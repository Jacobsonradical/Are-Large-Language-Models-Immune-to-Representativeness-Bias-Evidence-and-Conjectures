Given the information, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that shorter people are overrepresented among attackers.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability we're interested in as P(Tall | Evidence), where "Tall" refers to the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and "Evidence" refers to the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(Tall | Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Evidence)

From part b, we know that the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time, so P(Evidence | Tall) = 0.8.

Since the population is roughly equally split, we have P(Tall) = P(Not Tall) = 0.5.

However, we need to account for the fact that shorter people are overrepresented among attackers. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, this means that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(Tall) = 0.15.

To calculate P(Evidence), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is tall and the case where the attacker is not tall. Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Evidence | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

We already know P(Evidence | Tall) and P(Tall). To find P(Evidence | Not Tall), we use the fact that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person as not tall:

P(Evidence | Not Tall) = 1 - P(Not Evidence | Not Tall) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Putting it all together, we have:

P(Evidence) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Finally, we can calculate P(Tall | Evidence):

P(Tall | Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Evidence) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.1429

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1429, or 14.29%.
