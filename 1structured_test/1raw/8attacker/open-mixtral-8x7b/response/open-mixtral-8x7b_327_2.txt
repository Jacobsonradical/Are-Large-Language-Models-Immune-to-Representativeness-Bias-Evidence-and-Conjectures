To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

We have:
P(W|E) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller attacker)
P(E) = 0.15 (proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(E|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(E|W) = [P(W|E) * P(E)] / [P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|¬E) * P(¬E)]

We need to find P(W|¬E), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). This is the error rate of the witness, which is 20%:

P(W|¬E) = 0.2
P(¬E) = 0.85 (proportion of attackers under 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(E|W):

P(E|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(E|W) ≈ 0.3077

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3077 or 30.77%.
