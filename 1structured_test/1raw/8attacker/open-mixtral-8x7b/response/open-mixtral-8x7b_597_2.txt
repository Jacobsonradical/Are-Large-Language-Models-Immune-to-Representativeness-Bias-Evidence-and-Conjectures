To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements "a" and "b" to calculate the probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement and the attacker demographics, respectively. Then, we'll combine these probabilities using the principle of logical independence.

1. Probability based on the witness's statement (P(taller | witness)):

   The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (0.8) and errs in 20% of the cases (0.2). Since we have no information about whether the witness erred in this case, the probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement are equal to the witness's accuracy:

   P(taller | witness) = 0.8

2. Probability based on the attacker demographics (P(taller | demographics)):

   We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore,

   P(taller | demographics) = 0.15

3. Since the witness's accuracy and the attacker demographics are independent, we can combine their probabilities using the principle of logical independence:

   P(taller) = P(taller | witness) * P(taller | demographics)

   P(taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
