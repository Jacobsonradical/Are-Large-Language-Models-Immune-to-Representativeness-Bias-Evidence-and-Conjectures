Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, this implies that there's an 80% chance that the (at least one) attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.8}
