Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
P(Errs in identifying 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

According to the statement, the population is roughly equally divided between people under and at or above 185 cm. So, the probability of randomly selecting someone who is 185 cm or taller is:

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.50
P(Under 185 cm) = 0.50

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person given the scenario. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identification)

We know P(185 cm or taller) and P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.80. But we still need to calculate P(Witness identification). This is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identification | Under 185 cm) * P(Under 185 cm)
                                     = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50)
                                     = 0.60

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identification:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.667 or 67%.
