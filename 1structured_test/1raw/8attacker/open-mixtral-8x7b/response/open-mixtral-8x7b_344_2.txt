Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population: half of the people are shorter than 185 cm and half are 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's statement:

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when making this identification. Thus, the probability that the attacker is indeed 1
