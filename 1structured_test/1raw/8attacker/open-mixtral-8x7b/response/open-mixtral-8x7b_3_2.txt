Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that a randomly chosen person is at or above 185 cm:

P(person is at or above 185 cm) = 0.5

Since we want to find the probability that the attacker is at or above 1
