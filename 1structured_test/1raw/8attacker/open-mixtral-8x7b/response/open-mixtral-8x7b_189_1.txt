Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, contrary to the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is assessed to be correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we do not have enough information about P(not A), the total proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm. Without this information, we cannot calculate an accurate probability.

If you have additional information about P(not A), I would be happy to help you compute the probability.
