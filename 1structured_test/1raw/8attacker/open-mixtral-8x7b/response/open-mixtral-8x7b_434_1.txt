To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller

Using the given information:
P(A|B) = 0.8 (witness correct identification rate)
P(E) = 0.5 (population distribution)
P(B|E) = 0.8 (witness error rate)

We want to find P(A). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B). We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + (1 - P(B|not A)) * (1 - P(A))

Now, P(B|A) = 1 (since if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them correctly), and P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness error rate). Substituting these values in the equation for P(B):

P(B) = 1 * P(A) + (1 - 0.2 * (1 - P(A))) * (1 - P(A))

Now, we'll solve this equation for P(A):

P(A) = P(B) / (1 + 0.2 * (1 - P(B)))

From the given information, P(B) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Substituting P(B) in the equation for P(A):

P(A) = 0.12 / (1 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.12))
    ≈ 0.12 / 1.16
    ≈ 0.10345 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.10345}
