To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (when the person is actually 185 cm or taller). Let's denote this probability as P(w|t), where w is the event of the witness identifying the person's height correctly and t is the event that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.

We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(t).

We want to find P(t|w), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find:

P(t|w) = P(w|t) * P(t) / P(w)

We can calculate P(w) as follows:

P(w) = P(w and t) + P(w and not t)
P(w) = P(w|t) * P(t) + P(w|not t) * P(not t)
P(w) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
P(w) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(t|w):

P(t|w) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
P(t|w) â‰ˆ 0.345

However, since the question asks for an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we should use the witness's accuracy in identifying people as 185 cm or taller when given a person who is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
