Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%). This means that even though the general population is evenly split, attackers are not.

Now let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|~A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem, we know:
- P(A) + P(~A) = 1 (since the attacker is either 185 cm or taller or not)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

What we want to find is P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We don't have exact numbers for P(A) and P(~A), but since attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, let's assume P(A) ≤ 0.15 and P(~A) ≥ 0.85.

Substituting the values we know into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) ≥ [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Performing the calculation, we get:

P(A|B) ≥ 0.12 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is at least 0.12.
