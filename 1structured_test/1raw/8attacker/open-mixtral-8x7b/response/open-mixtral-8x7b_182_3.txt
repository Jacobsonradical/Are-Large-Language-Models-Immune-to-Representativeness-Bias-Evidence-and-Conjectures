Let's break down the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To do this, we will use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(not B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
