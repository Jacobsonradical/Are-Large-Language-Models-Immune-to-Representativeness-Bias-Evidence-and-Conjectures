Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We also know that the witness correctly identified someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is given by the product of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height:

P(Correctly identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(Correctly identified | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.15 x 0.8
= 0.12

Next, we need to find the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is given by the product of the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height:

P(Incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) x P(Incorrectly identified | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.85 x 0.2
= 0.17

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
