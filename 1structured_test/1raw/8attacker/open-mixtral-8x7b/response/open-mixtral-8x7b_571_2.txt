To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Then, the probability that the attacker's height was under 185 cm is 1 - P(T).

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the true height of the attacker:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness identifies under 185 cm | attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.85

Also, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

We can find the probability of the intersection term using the formula for conditional probability:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * P(T)

Similarly, we can find the probability of the witness identifying 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is under 185 cm) * P(attacker is under 185 cm)
= (0.8 * P(T)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(T)))

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * P(T)) / ((0.8 * P(T)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(T))))

Since we do not have enough information to determine the exact value of P(T), we cannot provide a single numerical estimate for the probability. However, if you would like to calculate the probability for a specific value of P(T), you can use the formula above. For example, if P(T) = 0.5, then the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.8.

Therefore, my answer is: {probability: approximately 0.8 for a specific P(T) value, cannot provide a single numerical estimate without more information}
