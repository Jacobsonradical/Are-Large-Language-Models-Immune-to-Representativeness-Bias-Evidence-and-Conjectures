To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

Let's break down the given information:
- The population is roughly equally divided into people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller.
- 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's define:
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- P(~A): Probability of the attacker being under 185 cm.
- P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(~B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as under 185 cm.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(~A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(~B|A) = 0.2, P(~B|~A) = 0.85, and P(B|~A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.15) * (0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1275
P(B) ≈ 0.2475

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.2475)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4848

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4848}
