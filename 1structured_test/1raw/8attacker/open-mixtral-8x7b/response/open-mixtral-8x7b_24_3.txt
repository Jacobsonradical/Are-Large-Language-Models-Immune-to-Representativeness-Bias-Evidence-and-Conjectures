Given the information provided, let's first calculate the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people of that height and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony, is:

P(tall | witness) = 0.80 * 0.5 (since there's a 50/50 chance the attacker is in the taller group) + 0.20 * 0 = 0.40

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the attacker population information. We know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the attacker population information, is:

P(tall | attacker population) = 0.15

Now, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine these two probabilities:

P(tall) = P(tall | witness) * P(witness | tall) + P(tall | attacker population) * P(attacker population | tall)

We are given that the witness's testimony is independent of the attacker population information. Therefore, P(witness | tall) = P(witness) and P(attacker population | tall) = P(attacker population). We are not given specific values for P(witness) and P(attacker population), but since both are related to the attacker's height, we can assume that they are equal, i.e., P(witness) = P(attacker population). Therefore, we can simplify Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(tall) = P(tall | witness) * P(witness) + P(tall | attacker population) * P(attacker population)
P(tall) = P(tall | witness) * P(witness) + P(tall | attacker population) * (1 - P(tall | witness))

We are not given P(witness), but we can solve for P(tall) as a function of P(witness):

P(tall) = 0.40 * P(witness) + 0.15 * (1 - P(witness))
P(tall) = 0.25 * P(witness) + 0.15

Since P(witness) is a probability between 0 and 1, the maximum value for P(tall) occurs when P(witness) = 1, in which case:

P(tall) = 0.25 * 1 + 0.15 = 0.40

Therefore, regardless of the value of P(witness), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at most 0.40.

Answer: {probability: 0.40}
