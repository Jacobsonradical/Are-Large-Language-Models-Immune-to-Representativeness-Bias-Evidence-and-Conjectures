To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Statement "a" provides the accuracy of the witness in judging a person's height under similar conditions as the night of the attack. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

Statement "b" provides that the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller. However, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness errs in identifying attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(Witness errs in identifying attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2
P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Substituting these values in the above equation:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 29%.
