To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when given a sample of people with equal numbers of individuals below and above 185 cm.
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while the remaining 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Then, we want to calculate P(A) = P(A|witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) + P(A|witness does not identify as 185 cm or taller) * P(witness does not identify as 185 cm or taller).

3. Given the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller (from statement "a"). So, P(A|witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
4. The total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller is given by the sum of probabilities when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller: P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(A) * 0.8 + (1-P(A)) * 0.2.
5. Given the witness does not identify someone as 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller (from statement "a"). So, P(A|witness does not identify as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.
6. We know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (from statement "b"). So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(A) using the values calculated above:
P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + (1-0.15) * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.18 = 0.3

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.3}.
