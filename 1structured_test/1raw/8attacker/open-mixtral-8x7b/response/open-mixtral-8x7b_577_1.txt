To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define two events:
- W: The witness correctly identifies that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- T: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

We know that P(W|T) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

We also know that P(T) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from part b of the information).

Now, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)

We already know P(W|T) and P(T). To find P(W|not T), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, we can use the complementary probability:

P(W|not T) = 1 - P(not W|not T) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

And P(not T) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85 (again, from part b).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.84

Finally, we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.1429

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1429 or 14.29%.
