Based on the given information, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This indicates that attacks by taller people are rarer.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% for such heights.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = probability of correct identification = 0.8
P(A) = prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (given in the problem)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for both correct identification and errors:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the witness's error rate for people below 185 cm, which is 20%:

P(B|not A) = probability of error = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
