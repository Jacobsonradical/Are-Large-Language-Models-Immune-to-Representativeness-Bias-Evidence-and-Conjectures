The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as follows:

Let's denote:
A - the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are people 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
