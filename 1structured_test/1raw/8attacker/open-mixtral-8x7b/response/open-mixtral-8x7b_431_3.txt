Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in the group of attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm than the general population.

Despite this, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate when the sample of people matches the conditions of that night (half under 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller).

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have specific numerical data about the population or the number of attacks, we will use the given percentages as our best estimates.

Let's define:
- P(A) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (0.8)
- P(B' ) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (1 - 0.8 = 0.2)
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

We know that:
- P(B|A) = 1 because if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them correctly as such.
- P(A) = 0.15 as mentioned earlier
- P(B|A') = 0.2 because the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

However, we don't have P(A') (the probability of an attacker being under 185 cm), which we need to calculate P(B|A') * P(A').

Since the population is roughly evenly split, we can estimate P(A') to be around 0.5 (0.5 for under 185 cm and 0.15 for 185 cm or taller).

Now we can compute:
- P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.5)) = 0.75

So, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.75}
