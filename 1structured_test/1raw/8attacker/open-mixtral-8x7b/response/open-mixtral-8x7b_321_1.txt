To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(A) is roughly equal to 0.5, as the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size.

However, the witness's ability to judge a person's height affects the probability of the attacker's height, given the witness's statement. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height, given the witness's statement:

P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) \* P(B) / P(witness)

We know P(witness|B) from the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
P(witness|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We know P(B) from the distribution of attackers' heights:
P(B) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate P(witness) as follows:
P(witness) = P(witness|B) \* P(B) + P(witness|not B) \* P(not B)

We know that P(witness|not B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (20% error rate). We also know that P(not B) is the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Therefore, P(witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22

Now, we can calculate P(B|witness) as follows:
P(B|witness) = P(witness|B) \* P(B) / P(witness) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.0909 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.413

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.413.
