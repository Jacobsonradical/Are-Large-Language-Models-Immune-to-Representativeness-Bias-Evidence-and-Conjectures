To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller,
C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|C') = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was not 185 cm or taller)

P(C) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(C') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

To find P(A), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(C) * P(B|C) + P(C') * P(B|C') * (1 - P(C)) / [P(C) * P(B|C) + P(C') * P(B|C')]

Substituting the values:

P(A) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.85) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A) ≈ 0.167 + 0.132 / (0.12 + 0.132)
P(A) ≈ 0.167 + 0.132 / 0.252
P(A) ≈ 0.167 + 0.524
P(A) ≈ 0.691
