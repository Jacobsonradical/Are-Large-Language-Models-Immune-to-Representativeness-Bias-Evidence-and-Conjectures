Let's break down the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when presented with a sample of people half of whom are shorter than 185 cm and half are 185 cm or taller. This implies that the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2 (20%).

b. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information above.

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have two possibilities:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of 0.15 (15%).
2. The attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as such, which has a probability of 0.2 (20%).

The total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.15 + 0.2 = 0.35, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
