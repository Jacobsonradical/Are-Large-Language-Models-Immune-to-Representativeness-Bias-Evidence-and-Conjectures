To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness will identify the attacker as such.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the product of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (0.8) and the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), which is:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.12}
