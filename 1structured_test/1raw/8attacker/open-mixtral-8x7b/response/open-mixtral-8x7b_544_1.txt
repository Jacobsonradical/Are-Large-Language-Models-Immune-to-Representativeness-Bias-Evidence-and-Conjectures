To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the likelihood of this scenario based on the witness's testimony and general population statistics.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Now let's consider the population statistics, where 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(185+ | witness) = P(witness | 185+) * P(185+) / P(witness)

We know that:
P(witness | 185+) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(185+) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(witness), we need to calculate the probability of the witness's testimony for both cases (under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller) and sum them up.

P(witness) = P(witness | 185-) * P(185-) + P(witness | 185+) * P(185+)
          = (1 - 0.8) * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15
          = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.15
          = 0.17 + 0.15
          = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(185+ | witness):

P(185+ | witness) = P(witness | 185+) * P(185+) / P(witness)
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.32
                 = 0.12 / 0.32
                 = 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.375.
