Let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that the population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm.
2. However, 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.
3. We have a witness who correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A), so let's break down each component:

- P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We don't know this value, but it's what we're trying to find.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is a combination of two scenarios: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them (0.8 * 0.15), and the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness erroneously identifies them as such (0.2 * 0.85). So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
0.2 = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.37
P(A) = 0.2 * 0.37 / 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.0925 or 9.25%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0925}
