To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the following terms:
- P(T): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|S): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(W|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(W|S) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, which means:
P(S) = 0.85

Therefore, we can find P(T) as follows:
P(T) = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

However, given the witness's testimony, we need to adjust P(T) based on the witness's accuracy. We can do this as follows:
P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)]

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.273

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.273.
