Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% likelihood) than 185 cm or taller (15% likelihood).

Now, we have a witness who has been assessed as having an 80% success rate in determining height and a 20% error rate.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller and that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Correct ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Correct ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Incorrect ID | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Given the witness's 80% success rate, we can say:
P(Correct ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

However, we want the reverse probability: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct ID). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct ID) = P(Correct ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Correct ID)

Since the witness's correct ID rate is 80%, we can assume that the overall correct ID rate is also 80%. Therefore, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct ID) = 0.29 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.0435 / 0.8
= 0.054375 or ~5.44%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 5.44%.
