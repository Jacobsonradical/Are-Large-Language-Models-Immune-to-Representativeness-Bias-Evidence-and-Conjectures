Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

First, let's consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. To calculate the probability of the witness being correct, we multiply the base rate by the witness's accuracy: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.

Next, let's consider the alternative hypothesis: the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are below 185 cm). Since 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, the probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17, or 17%.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(185 cm | Witness) = P(Witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(Witness)

P(Witness) = P(Witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(Witness | <185 cm) * P(<185 cm)

P(Witness) = (0.12) * (0.15) + (0.17) * (0.85) = 0.018 + 0.1445 = 0.1625

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(185 cm | Witness) = P(Witness | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(Witness) = (0.12) * (0.15) / (0.1625) â‰ˆ 0.1106

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.1106 or 11.06%.
