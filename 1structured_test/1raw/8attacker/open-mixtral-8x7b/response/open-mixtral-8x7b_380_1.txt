To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the question:
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the correct height given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people taller and shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
P(B) is the probability of the observed evidence, which depends on both P(B|A) and P(B|not A). However, calculating P(B|not A) is complex due to the given information structure. Instead, let's calculate the likelihood ratio L = P(B|A)/P(B|not A).

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, given as 0.2 (20%).

So, L = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Now, we can estimate P(A|B) without calculating P(B) directly by using the likelihood ratio:
P(A|B) ≈ L * P(A) = 4 * 0.15 ≈ 0.6

Answer: {probability: 0.6}
