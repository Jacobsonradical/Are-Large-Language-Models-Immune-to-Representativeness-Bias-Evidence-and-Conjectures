Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and then the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller erroneously.

P(Correctly identifies height) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies height) = 1 - P(Correctly identifies height) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

From the court's assessment, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

The scenario described in "a" indicates that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, but 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

Given these probabilities, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identification)

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identification | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

P(Witness identification | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

P(Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this value, we find:
