Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for such heights.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

The witness correct identification rate is 80%, so the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given the witness's testimony). However, because only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we would expect a lower probability without the witness's testimony.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We have the following probabilities from the information provided:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct identification rate)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8)) = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.16) = 0.06 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.273 (27.3%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 27.3%.
