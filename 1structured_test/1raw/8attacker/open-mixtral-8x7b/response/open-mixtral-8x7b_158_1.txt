To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Given these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

From statement "a", we have P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W|¬A) = 0.2.
From statement "b", we have P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85.

We can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.273

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.273}
