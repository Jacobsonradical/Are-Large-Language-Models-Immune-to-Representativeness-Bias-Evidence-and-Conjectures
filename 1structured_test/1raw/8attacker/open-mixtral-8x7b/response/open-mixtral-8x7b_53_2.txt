Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This shows that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm than over.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's identification (B).

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correct identification)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
