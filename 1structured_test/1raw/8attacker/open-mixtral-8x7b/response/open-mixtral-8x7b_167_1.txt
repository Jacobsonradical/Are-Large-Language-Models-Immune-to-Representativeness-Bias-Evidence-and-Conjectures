Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability the witness identifies the attacker's height correctly
P(~B) as the probability the witness identifies the attacker's height incorrectly
P(A') as the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(B|A') as the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not

From the problem, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness errs by identifying the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4286 or 42.86%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4286}.
