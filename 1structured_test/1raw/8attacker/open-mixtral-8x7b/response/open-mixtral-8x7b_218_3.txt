Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = Prevalence of attackers who are 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally split)
P(B|A) = Probability of correct identification = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = Probability of incorrect identification = 0.2
P(¬A) = Prevalence of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
≈ 0.667 or 66.7%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.667 or 66.7%}
