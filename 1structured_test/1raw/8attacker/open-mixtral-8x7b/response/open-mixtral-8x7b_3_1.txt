Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under similar conditions has been assessed. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(Tall | Evidence), where "Tall" represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and "Evidence" represents the given information about the witness's identification.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(Tall | Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Evidence)

First, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(Tall) = 0.15

Second, P(Evidence | Tall) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height, P(Evidence | Tall) = 0.8

Lastly, P(Evidence) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability: P(Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Evidence | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

We already know P(Evidence | Tall) = 0.8 and P(Tall) = 0.15. Similarly, P(Not Tall) = 0.85 and P(Evidence | Not Tall) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% (given by the witness's error rate). So P(Evidence | Not Tall) = 0.2

Putting it all together, we have:

P(Evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability we are interested in:

P(Tall | Evidence) = P(Evidence | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

probability: 0.41
