Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as an 185 cm or taller attacker.

P(correct identification) = 0.8
P(incorrect identification) = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can calculate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5
P(attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.5

Given these probabilities, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = [P(witness identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identification)

We need to calculate P(witness identification), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(witness identification) = P(witness identification and attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification and attacker is under 185 cm)
= P(witness identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification | attacker is under 185 cm) * P(attacker is under 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification):

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identification) = [P(witness identification | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identification)
= [(0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6]
= 0.6667, or approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.67}.
