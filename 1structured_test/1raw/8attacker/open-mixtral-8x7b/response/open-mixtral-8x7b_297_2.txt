To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 1
