Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This suggests that short people are both more common and more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the witness being correct 80% of the time in such judgments.

Given these two points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. 

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be written as:

P(tall | witness report) = P(witness report | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness report)

We are given:
P(witness report | tall) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is tall)
P(tall) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between tall and not tall)

To calculate P(witness report), we need to consider the two possibilities: the witness correctly identified a tall attacker or the witness incorrectly identified a short attacker. 

P(witness report) = P(witness report | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness report | not tall) * P(not tall)

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is tall:
P(witness report | tall) = 0.8

And given that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is not tall:
P(witness report | not tall) = 1 - P(witness report | tall not) = 1 - 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.96 (because 15% of the population is tall and the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not tall)

We are given that the population is roughly equally split between tall and not tall:
P(tall) = 0.5
P(not tall) = 1 - P(tall) = 0.5

Substituting these values into our equation for P(witness report):

P(witness report) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.96 * 0.5) = 0.88

Now we can calculate P(tall | witness report):

P(tall | witness report) = P(witness report | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness report) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.88 â‰ˆ 0.4545

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.4545.
