To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can use this information to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We'll call this probability P(185|W), where 185 represents the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and W represents the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(185|W) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person)

However, to estimate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we also need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller in the population. From statement "b", we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. We'll call this probability P(185), and it is the probability we want to estimate.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(185|W):

P(185|W) = P(W|185) * P(185) / P(W)

We already know P(W|185) = 0.8 from statement "a", and P(185) = 0.15 from statement "b". To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|185) * P(185) + P(W|not 185) * P(not 185)

From statement "a", P(W|not 185) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller), and from statement "b", P(not 185) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(185|W):

P(185|W) = P(W|185) * P(185) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

However, this is not the probability we want to estimate. We want P(185), which is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we can use the fact that P(185|W) = 0.8 and the relationship:

P(W) = P(W|185) * P(185) + P(W|not 185) * P(not 185)

We can solve for P(185) by rearranging the above equation:

P(185) = (P(W) - P(W|not 185) * P(not 185)) / P(W|185)

Plugging in the values we calculated above:

P(185) = (0.29 - (0.2 * 0.85)) / 0.8 ≈ 0.176

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.176}
