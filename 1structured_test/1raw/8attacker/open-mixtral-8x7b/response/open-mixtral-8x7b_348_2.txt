Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, and the attacker is more likely to be under 185 cm, we can infer that there are more opportunities for the witness to make an incorrect identification of a person as being 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) = P(Witness ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are interested in estimating P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller). 

Since the witness identification is given as 80% correct, we can assume that the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.80. 

However, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.20, but since there are more people under 185 cm, the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is lower.

Given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness Identification) / P(Witness ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is not 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness ID | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Witness ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can estimate:

P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This means that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, while there is an 85% chance that the attacker is under 185 cm.
