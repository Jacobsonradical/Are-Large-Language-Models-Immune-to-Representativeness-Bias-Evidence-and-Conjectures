Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Given that the population of people under and over 185 cm is roughly equal, we can estimate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as 0.50.

However, we also know that the witness is more likely to identify someone as being 185 cm or taller even when they are not (20% error rate). To account for this, we need to adjust our estimation by taking into account the witness's error rate.

The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not is:
P(Incorrect ID | Not 185 cm) = P(Not 185 cm) * P(Incorrect ID)
P(Incorrect ID | Not 185 cm) = 0.50 * 0.20 = 0.10

Now, to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm | Identified as 185 cm) = [P(Identified as 185 cm | 185 cm) * P(185 cm)] / [P(Identified as 185 cm | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(Identified as 185 cm | Not 185 cm) * P(Not 185 cm)]

Plugging in the values:
P(185 cm | Identified as 185 cm) = [(0.80 * 0.50) / ((0.80 * 0.50) + (0.10 * 0.50))]
P(185 cm | Identified as 185 cm) â‰ˆ 0.8889 or 88.89%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 88.89%.
