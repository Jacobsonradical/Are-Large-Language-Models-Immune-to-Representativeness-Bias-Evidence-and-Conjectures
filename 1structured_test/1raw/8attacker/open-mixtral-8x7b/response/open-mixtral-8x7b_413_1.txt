Given the two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (29%)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
