To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, the false negative rate, or the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller, is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of randomly choosing an attacker who is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller), and P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(E), we need to consider two cases: the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the case where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(~H) as 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

To calculate P(E|~H), we need to consider the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From statement "a", we know that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. So, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
