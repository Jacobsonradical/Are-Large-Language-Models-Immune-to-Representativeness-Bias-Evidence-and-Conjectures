To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability of the witness identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm
- P(W): probability of the witness being correct in their identification
- P(W' ): probability of the witness being incorrect in their identification

From the given information, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 1 (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will identify them as such)
P(B' |A') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B' |A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ( (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ) â‰ˆ 0.225

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.225.
