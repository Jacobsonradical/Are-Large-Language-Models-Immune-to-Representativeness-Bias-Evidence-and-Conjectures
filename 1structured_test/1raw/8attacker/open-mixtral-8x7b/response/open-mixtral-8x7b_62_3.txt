Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of them making an error:

P(correct_id) = 0.80
P(incorrect_id) = 1 - P(correct_id) = 0.20

According to statement (a), 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Now, we'll calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification:

P(attacker_185cm+ | correct_id) = 15% = 0.15
P(attacker_185cm- | incorrect_id) = 85% = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's correct identification:

P(correct_id | attacker_185cm+) = P(attacker_185cm+) * P(correct_id | attacker_185cm+) / P(correct_id)
P(attacker_185cm+) = 0.15
P(correct_id | attacker_185cm+) = 1
P(correct_id) = 0.80

P(correct_id | attacker_185cm+) = (0.15 * 1) / 0.80 = 0.1875

However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error and incorrectly identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(incorrect_id | attacker_185cm-) = P(attacker_185cm-) * P(incorrect_id | attacker_185cm-) / P(incorrect_id)
P(attacker_185cm-) = 0.85
P(incorrect_id | attacker_185cm-) = 0.20
P(incorrect_id) = 1 - P(correct_id) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

P(incorrect_id | attacker_185cm-) = (0.85 * 0.20) / 0.20 = 0.85

Now, we can find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(attacker_185cm+ | witness_id_185cm+) = P(correct_id | attacker_185cm+) * P(attacker_185cm+) + P(incorrect_id | attacker_185cm-) * P(attacker_185cm-)
P(attacker_185cm+ | witness_id_185cm+) = (0.1875 * 0.15) + (0.85 * 0.85) = 0.13125 + 0.7225 = 0.85375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately {probability: 0.85375}.
