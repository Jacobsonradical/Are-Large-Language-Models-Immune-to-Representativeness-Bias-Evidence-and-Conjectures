To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, the false negative rate is 100% - 80% = 20%.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, the witness has a 20% chance of misidentifying a person who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, we need to account for both the witness's error rate and the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem tells us:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time) and P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to account for both the true positives and false positives.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

So, P(B and not A) = 0.17 \* 0.85 = 0.1445

Thus, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 0.4535 (or 45.35%).
