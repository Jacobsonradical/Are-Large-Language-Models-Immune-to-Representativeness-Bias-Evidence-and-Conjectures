To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, but their ability to judge a person's height is not perfect. The witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time, but they also erred 20% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(taller | witness) = P(witness | taller) \* P(taller) / P(witness)

We are given:
P(witness | taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(taller) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(witness) = P(witness | taller) \* P(taller) + P(witness | shorter) \* P(shorter)

We need to calculate P(witness | shorter) and P(shorter).

P(witness | shorter) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the attacker's height 20% of the time)
P(shorter) = 1 - P(taller) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(witness):

P(witness) = P(witness | taller) \* P(taller) + P(witness | shorter) \* P(shorter)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(taller | witness) = P(witness | taller) \* P(taller) / P(witness)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
