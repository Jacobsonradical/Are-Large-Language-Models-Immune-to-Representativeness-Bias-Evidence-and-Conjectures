Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From part (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

From part (b), the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85. We need to find P(B|not A) which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 20% in part (b).

So, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
