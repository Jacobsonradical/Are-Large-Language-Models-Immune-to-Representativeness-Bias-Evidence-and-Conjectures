To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) about the attacker's height based on new evidence (witness report).

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability of the witness reporting that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the posterior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness report.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness reporting an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness reporting an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they actually are not.

From the problem statement, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.667 (or 66.7%).
