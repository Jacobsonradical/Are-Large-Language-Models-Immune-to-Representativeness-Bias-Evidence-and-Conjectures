To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This gives us a conditional probability of observing the witness's statement, given the attacker's height:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness says not 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This gives us the prior probabilities:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = 
[P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / 
[P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 
 P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)]

= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

= 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17)

= 0.09 / 0.26

= 0.34615384615

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.346}
