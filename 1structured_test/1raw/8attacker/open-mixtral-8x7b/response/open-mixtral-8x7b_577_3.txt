To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller regardless of the witness's identification is 0.15 (15%).
3. To calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   - P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   - Where P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 1), P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which we can calculate as the weighted sum of the witness being correct and the witness being incorrect).
4. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:
   - P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   - Where P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2, or the 20% error rate), and P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller (0.85).
5. Plugging in the values, we get:
   - P(B) = (1)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32
6. Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
   - P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1)*(0.15) / (0.32) â‰ˆ 0.4688

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.47 (or 47%).
