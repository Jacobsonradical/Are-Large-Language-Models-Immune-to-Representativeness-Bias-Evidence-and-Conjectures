To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while the remaining 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have P(B|A) from statement "a", which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time). We also have P(A) from statement "b", which is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|not A), we can use the complementary probability from statement "a": P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

We also need to find P(not A) from statement "b", which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
