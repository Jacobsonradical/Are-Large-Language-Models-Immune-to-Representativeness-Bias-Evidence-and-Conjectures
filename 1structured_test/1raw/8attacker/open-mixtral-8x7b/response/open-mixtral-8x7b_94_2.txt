Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80%. 

Then, we'll calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not (which is the error rate of 20%).

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height.

Let's calculate:

P(Correct Identification) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
P(Error) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (assumed, based on the population)
P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.5

We want to find P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (correct identification)
and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5

We need to calculate P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller):
P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6 (since the error rate is 20%)

Now we can calculate the required probability:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, or approximately 67%

Answer: {probability: 0.67}
