Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80%. We also know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. 

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to multiply these two probabilities together.

So, the calculation would be: 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person) = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.12}
