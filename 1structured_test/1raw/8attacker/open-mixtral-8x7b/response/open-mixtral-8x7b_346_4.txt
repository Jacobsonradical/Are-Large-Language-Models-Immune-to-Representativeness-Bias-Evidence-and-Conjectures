Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The error rate is 20%, or 0.2, meaning the witness might incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50% probability for either group. Thus, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.5
= 0.4

However, since we also know that the witness might make mistakes, we must account for this error rate:

P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * 0.5
= 0.1

To obtain the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.5 / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
= 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
