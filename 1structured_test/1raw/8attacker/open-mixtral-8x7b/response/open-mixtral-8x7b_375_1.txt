Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From part b, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time) and P(W'|A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases).

From part a, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population) and P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population).

Now, we want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find the probability:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
