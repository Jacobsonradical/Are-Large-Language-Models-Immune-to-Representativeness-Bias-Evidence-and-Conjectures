To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and erred 20% of the time. The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of such attackers are people 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, before any witness information is considered.

To find the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B represents the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from statement "a")
- P(A) = 0.15 (from statement "b")
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (from statement "a")
- P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (from statement "b")

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
