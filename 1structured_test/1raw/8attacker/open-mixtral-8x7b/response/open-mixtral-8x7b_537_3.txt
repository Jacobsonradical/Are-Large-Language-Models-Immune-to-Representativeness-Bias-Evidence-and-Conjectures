Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the attacker's height 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, where A' represents the complement of A).

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to calculate P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

We already know the values for P(B|A), P(A), and P(A'). To find P(B|A'), we reason as follows:

Since the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, and the witness is equally likely to err in both directions, we can assume that the witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as taller 10% of the time (0.2 * 0.5) and would incorrectly identify a taller person as shorter 10% of the time (0.2 * 0.5). In the context of the total population, this means that 10% of the time, a person who is not 185 cm or taller would be incorrectly identified as such. Thus, P(B|A') = 0.1.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.08) = 0.12 / 0.2 = 0.6

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6}
