To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(U) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E) as the probability that the witness errs in identifying the attacker's height

Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(U) = P(U|T) * P(T) + P(U|~T) * P(~T)

Where ~T denotes the attacker's height is under 185 cm, and P(U|~T) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability P(T|U):

P(T|U) = P(U|T) * P(T) / P(U)

From statement "a", we know P(U|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(U) as:

P(U) = P(U|T) * P(T) + P(U|~T) * P(~T)
= (0.8 * P(T)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(T)))

Now, we can find P(T|U):

P(T|U) = P(U|T) * P(T) / P(U)
= 0.8 * P(T) / ((0.8 * P(T)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(T))))

To find P(T), we need to take into account the information from statement "b". Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(T) = 0.15

Now, we can find P(T|U):

P(T|U) = 0.8 * 0.15 / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1 - 0.15)))
~= 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
