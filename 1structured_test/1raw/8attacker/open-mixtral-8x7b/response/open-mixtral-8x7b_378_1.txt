Let's break down the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means the witness has a 0.8 probability of being correct when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, and a 0.2 probability of being correct when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. However, we don't know how this distribution is affected by the conditions similar to that night.

Given this information, we cannot directly calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. In order to calculate this, we would need to know the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the conditions similar to that night.

Without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we cannot answer the question in the requested format.
