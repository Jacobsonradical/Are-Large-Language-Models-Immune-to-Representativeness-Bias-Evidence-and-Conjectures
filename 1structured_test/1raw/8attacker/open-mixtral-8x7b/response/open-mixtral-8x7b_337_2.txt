Given the information, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

2. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we cannot directly calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, but we can estimate it.

The witness's accuracy rate is 0.8 (80%). Since the error rate is 0.2 (20%), this means that when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance they are wrong. 

However, since the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller, we might infer that the witness's error rate could apply equally to both groups. Therefore, we might estimate that the probability of the witness being wrong in this case is also 20%.

Subtracting this error rate from 1 (100%), we get an estimated probability of 80% that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

So, {probability: 0.8}
