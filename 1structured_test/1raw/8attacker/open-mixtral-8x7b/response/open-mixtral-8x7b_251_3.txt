To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(A|B): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such
- P(A'|B ): probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as such
- P(B|A): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are
- P(B|A' ): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B'|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)
- P(A) + P(A' ) = 1 (attacker's height is either 185 cm or taller, or shorter)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A' ) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A' ) * P(A' ))

However, we do not know P(B|A' ). But we can use the law of total probability to find it:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A' ) * P(A' )

Now we can solve for P(B|A' ):

P(B|A' ) = (P(B) - P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(A' ) = (1 - 0.8 * 0.15) / 0.85 ≈ 0.5294

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A' ) * P(A' )) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.5294 * 0.85) ≈ 0.198

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.198}
