Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, and the error rate is 20%. Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm, we can estimate the probability as follows:

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker's height is at/above 185 cm. Since only 15% of attackers are at/above 185 cm, we have:

P(A) = 0.15

We also know that the witness correctly identifies a person as at/above 185 cm 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as at/above 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed at/above 185 cm, is:

P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | A) = 0.8

However, we want to find out the probability of the attacker being at/above 185 cm, given that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm. Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute this as follows:

P(A | witness identifies at/above 185 cm) = [P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | A) * P(A)] / P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm)

We have P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | A) and P(A). To compute P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm) = P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | A) * P(A) + P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(A) = 0.15, P(not A) = 0.85, and P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm | not A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

Substituting these values gives us:

P(witness identifies at/above 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute the probability of the attacker being at/above 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm:

P(A | witness identifies at/above 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
