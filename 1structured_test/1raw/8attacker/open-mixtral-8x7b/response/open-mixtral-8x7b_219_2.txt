To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights. We will apply Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, while B represents the observed evidence, which is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. Also, the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(not B|A) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
