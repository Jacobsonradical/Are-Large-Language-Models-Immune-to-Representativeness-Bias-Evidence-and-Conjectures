To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they indeed are
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(not B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.15 \* 0.85 + 0.85 \* 0.15 = 0.255 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and the witness identifies them as 185 cm or taller 15% of the time and identifies the actual taller attackers as shorter 15% of the time)

We need to find:
- P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - (0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2) = 0.59

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.255 \* 0.59 + 0.8 \* 0.15) â‰ˆ 0.318

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.318}
