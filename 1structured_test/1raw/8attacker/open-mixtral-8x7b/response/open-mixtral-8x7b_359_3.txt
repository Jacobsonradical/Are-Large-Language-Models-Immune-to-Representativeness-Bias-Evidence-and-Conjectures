Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter individuals are more likely to be attackers.

However, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height under similar conditions. The witness is also wrong 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population statistics and the accuracy of the witness. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we can start with an initial estimate of 0.8 (or 80%) that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

However, we also need to account for the fact that shorter individuals are more likely to be attackers. To do this, we can consider the likelihood of the witness being wrong (20%) and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. To calculate a more refined estimate, we can multiply the initial estimate of 0.8 by the likelihood that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), and then divide this by the likelihood that the witness is wrong or that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, whichever is less likely.

The likelihood that the witness is wrong (0.2) is greater than the likelihood that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), so we will use 0.2 for our calculation.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2 = 0.6 / 0.2 = 3

However, we need to convert this to a probability between 0 and 1 by dividing the result by 15 (the maximum possible value of the numerator):

3 / 15 = 0.2

Therefore, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
