Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since we know that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, this means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're correct (favorable outcome) and a 20% chance they're not (unfavorable outcome).

The probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = Favorable outcomes / (Favorable outcomes + Unfavorable outcomes)
= 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.20)
= 0.80 / 1.00
= 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
