To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|B): probability of the witness mistakenly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement:
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(W|B) = 0.2
P(A) + P(B) = 1

We are given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so:
P(B) = 0.85

Therefore,
P(A) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
