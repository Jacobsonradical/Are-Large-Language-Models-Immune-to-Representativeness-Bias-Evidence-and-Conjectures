Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185cm or taller correctly:

P(Correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185cm or taller attacker 80% of the time)

And the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185cm or taller incorrectly:

P(Incorrect) = 1 - P(Correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

From statement a, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(185cm or taller | Witness's Statement) = [P(Witness's Statement | 185cm or taller) * P(185cm or taller)] / P(Witness's Statement)

We can calculate P(Witness's Statement) as the sum of the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185cm or taller and the probability of identifying the attacker as 185cm or taller when they are not:

P(Witness's Statement) = P(Correct) * P(185cm or taller) + P(Incorrect) * P(Not 185cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185cm or taller | Witness's Statement) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29]
= 0.3862

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.3862 or 38.62%.
