Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the assessment is correct and a 20% chance that it's an error.

Given that the population is roughly evenly split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller, and the witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

0.8 (probability of correct assessment) + (0.2 * 0.5) (probability of incorrect assessment, given the even population split)

This gives us:

0.8 + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9}
