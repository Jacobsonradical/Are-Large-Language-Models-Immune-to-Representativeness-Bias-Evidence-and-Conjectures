Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). However, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller regardless of the witness's identification.

b) Among attackers of this type, only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This implies that, without any additional information, the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.8)
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which requires the use of the law of total probability)

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345
