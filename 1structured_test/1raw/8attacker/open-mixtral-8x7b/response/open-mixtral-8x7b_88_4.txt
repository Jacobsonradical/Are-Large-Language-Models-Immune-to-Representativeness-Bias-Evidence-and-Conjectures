To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the total number of correct identifications the witness would make out of a sample of 100 people:

Correct identifications = 50 (people under 185 cm) * (100% - 20%) + 50 (people 185 cm or taller) * 80% = 40 + 40

Now, let's calculate how many of those correct identifications would be people 185 cm or taller:

People 185 cm or taller = Correct identifications * Percentage of people 185 cm or taller = 80 * 15% = 12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
