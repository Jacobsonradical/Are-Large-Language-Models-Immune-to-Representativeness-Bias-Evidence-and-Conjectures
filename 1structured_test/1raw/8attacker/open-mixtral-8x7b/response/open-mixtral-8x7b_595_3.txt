Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80%. This is our "positive" case.

The complementary probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is given as 20%. This is our "negative" case.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, it's more likely that a randomly selected attacker is under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness's identification given the actual height of the attacker.

1. If the attacker is under 185 cm, the witness identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (negative case).
2. If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time (positive case).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can apply Bayes' theorem to find this:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 80%, and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15% based on the given information.

We need to calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) next. This can be calculated as:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is under 185 cm) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is under 185 cm) is 20%, and P(Attacker is under 185 cm) is 85%.

Substituting the above values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15)] = 0.12 / (0.17 + 0.12) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
