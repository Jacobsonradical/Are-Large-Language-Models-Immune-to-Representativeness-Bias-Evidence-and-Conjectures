Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height was assessed. They are correct 80% of the time and err 20% when making such judgments.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that an 185 cm or taller person was indeed identified as such.

However, there is still a 20% chance that the witness erred in their judgment. Due to the population's distribution, if the witness incorrectly identified a person below 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, there's a higher likelihood that this person is indeed an attacker (remember, 85% of attackers are below 185 cm).

Taking both possibilities into account, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm) = P(witness correct) * P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm | witness correct) + P(witness error) * P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm | witness error)

P(witness correct) = 0.8
P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm | witness correct) = 1
P(witness error) = 0.2
P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm | witness error) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Substituting these values, we have:

P(attacker height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.83.
