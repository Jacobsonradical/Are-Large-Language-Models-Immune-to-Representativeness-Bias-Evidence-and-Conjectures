Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that there is an 80% chance that if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will identify the attacker as such. It also means that there is a 20% chance that if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identification)

We are given P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(witness identification | shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (from part a). We need to find P(witness identification), which we can calculate as:

P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identification)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.38

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.38}
