To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185+ | Witness identifies as 185+) = P(Witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness identifies as 185+)

We are given:
- P(Witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(185+) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(Witness identifies as 185+) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 (probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(185+ | Witness identifies as 185+):

P(185+ | Witness identifies as 185+) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.5 or 50%.
