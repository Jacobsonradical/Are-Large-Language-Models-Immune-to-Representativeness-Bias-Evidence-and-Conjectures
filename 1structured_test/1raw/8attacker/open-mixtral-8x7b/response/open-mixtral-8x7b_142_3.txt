To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability from the distribution of people's heights. We will apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence, i.e., the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
P(B|A) = Witness accuracy, which is 0.8 (80% chance that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:
- The witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- The witness is incorrect and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not. Since the witness is erroneous 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
