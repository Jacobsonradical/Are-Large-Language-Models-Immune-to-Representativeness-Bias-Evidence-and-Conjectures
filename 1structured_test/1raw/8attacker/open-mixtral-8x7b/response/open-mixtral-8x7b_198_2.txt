Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is assessed to be correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36 or 36%.
