To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We have P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size).

From the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we can calculate the probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller as 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate), while the probability of erroneously identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Now, let's calculate P(B|A) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. We are given this information as 0.15 (15%).

Similarly, let's calculate P(B|not A) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a randomly chosen person is not 185 cm or taller. This would be 0.025 (1 - (1-0.15)/0.5).

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1-P(A))
P(B) = (0.15) * (0.5) + (0.025) * (0.5)

Calculating the above expression, we get:
P(B) = 0.09375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.09375}
