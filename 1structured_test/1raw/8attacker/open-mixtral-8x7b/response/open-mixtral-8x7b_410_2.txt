To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. 

To combine these pieces of information, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which we know is 0.8 from statement "a". Then, we multiply this probability by the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 from statement "b".

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

= 0.8 x 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.
