Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when comparing people of equal probability (50% short, 50% tall).

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.

To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15).
- P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85).
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8, as per the witness's accuracy).
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.2, as per the witness's error rate).

Now, plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
