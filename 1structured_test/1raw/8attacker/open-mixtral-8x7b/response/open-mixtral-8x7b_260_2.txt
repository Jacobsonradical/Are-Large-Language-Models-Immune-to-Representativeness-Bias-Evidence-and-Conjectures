Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they indeed are. This is the witness's accuracy when identifying people who meet or exceed the height of 185 cm, which is 80% based on the information provided.

Now, we need to consider the base rate, which is the ratio of people who are 185 cm or taller to the entire population. We are told that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm. Therefore, the base rate is 0.5 or 50%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
and P(A) = 0.5 (50% base rate)

We need to find P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.667 or 66.7%.
