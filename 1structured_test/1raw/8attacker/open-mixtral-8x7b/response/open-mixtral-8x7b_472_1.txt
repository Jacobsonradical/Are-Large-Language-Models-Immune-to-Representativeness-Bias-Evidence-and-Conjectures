To reason through this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial beliefs (prior probability) based on new evidence (likelihood).

Here, the prior probability is the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which according to point "a" is 15%. 

The likelihood is the probability that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given their actual height. According to point "b", the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a 185 cm or taller person (0.8)
P(B|not A) as the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (0.2)

We want to find: P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
Then, calculate P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17] â‰ˆ 0.3158

{probability: 0.3158}
