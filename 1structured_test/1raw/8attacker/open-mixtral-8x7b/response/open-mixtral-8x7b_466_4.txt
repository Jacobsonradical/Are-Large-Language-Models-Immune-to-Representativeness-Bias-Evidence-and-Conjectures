To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%).
4. The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).
5. We want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need the total probability of identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This includes the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the cases where the witness errs when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already have P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|not A), the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which occurs 20% of the time.

P(B|not A) = 0.2
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
