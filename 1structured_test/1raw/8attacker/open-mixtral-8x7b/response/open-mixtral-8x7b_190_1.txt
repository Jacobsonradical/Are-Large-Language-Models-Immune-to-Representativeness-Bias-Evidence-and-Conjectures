Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct identification) = 0.80
P(Incorrect identification) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Let's denote the attacker's height as H, where H = 1 if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and H = 0 otherwise. We want to estimate P(H=1 | Evidence). According to the witness's testimony, the attacker was identified as H=1.

We are given that the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller, so P(H=1) = P(H=0) = 0.5.

However, we are also told that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, or P(H=0|Attacker) = 0.85, and therefore P(H=1|Attacker) = 0.15.

Given these probabilities, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification:

P(H=1 | Evidence) = P(H=1 | Identified as H=1)
= [P(Identified as H=1 | H=1) * P(H=1)] / P(Identified as H=1)
= [0.80 * 0.5] / [0.80 * 0.5 + 0.20 * 0.5]
= 0.20 / (0.20 + 0.10)
= 0.6667, or 66.67%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 66.67%.
