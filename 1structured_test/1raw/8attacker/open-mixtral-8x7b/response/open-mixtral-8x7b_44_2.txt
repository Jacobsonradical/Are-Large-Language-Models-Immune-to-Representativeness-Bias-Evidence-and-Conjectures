To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, the probability is:

0.8 * 1 = 0.8 (or 80%)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller regardless of the witness's identification. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and we assume the population of attackers is roughly equal in size, the probability is:

0.15 = 0.15 (or 15%)

Since these two events are mutually exclusive, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and ¬B is the event that the witness did not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85) ≈ 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.29}
