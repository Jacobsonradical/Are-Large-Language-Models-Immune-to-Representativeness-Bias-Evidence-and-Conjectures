To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(Correct | 185+): probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such
- P(Error | <185): probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(Correct | 185+) = 0.8
- P(Error | <185) = 0.2
- P(B | A) = P(Correct | 185+) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(!A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we want to calculate P(A | B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / [P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | !A) * P(!A)]

We need to find P(B | !A):
P(B | !A) = P(Error | <185) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(A | B):
P(A | B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))] = 0.3

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3 (30%).
