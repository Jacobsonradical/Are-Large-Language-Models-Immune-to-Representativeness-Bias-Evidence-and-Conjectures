To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller:
P(B|A) = 0.8

However, the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm:
P(¬B|¬A) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(A and B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A and B) = P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, we can calculate P(¬A and ¬B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm and the witness identifies the attacker as under 185 cm:

P(¬A and ¬B) = P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Using the formula P(A) = P(A and B) + P(¬A and ¬B), we can find P(A):

P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.29}
