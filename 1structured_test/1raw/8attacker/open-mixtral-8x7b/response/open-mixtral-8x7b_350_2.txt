To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence (witness report).

First, let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (hypothesis)
- P(A'): probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (complementary hypothesis)
- P(W|A): probability of the witness report given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A'): probability of the witness report given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(A): prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is unknown but will be updated using Bayes' theorem.

From statement (a), we have:
P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85

From statement (b), we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
P(W|A') = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.41}
