To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B|¬A):

P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness identified the height correctly 80% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.276

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.276 (27.6%).
