Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from "b")

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not actually 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm):

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time, as given in "b")

Now, since we know that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = 
[P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / 
[P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + 
[P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)] 

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)) 

Final answer: {probability: 0.8, explanation: The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.}
