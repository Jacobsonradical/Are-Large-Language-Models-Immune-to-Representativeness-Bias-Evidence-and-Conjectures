To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while the rest are shorter than 185 cm.

To combine these pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we have P(B|A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 or 80%.

From statement "b", we have P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 or 15%.

We also need to find P(B|A'), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, we have P(B|A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Finally, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use the law of total probability to calculate this as P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A').

Putting in the numbers, we get P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26 or 26%.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 = 0.12 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46 or 46%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.46 or 46%.
