Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is assessed to be correct 80% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use the following formula, which is a form of Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct 80% of the time when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
