To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- q as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (so q = 1 - p)

Given the two scenarios, we can create a system of equations:

Scenario a: 0.85 * p + 0.5 * q = 0.5 (This is because there's an 85% chance of picking an attacker under 185 cm if the attacker is under 185 cm, and a 50% chance of picking an attacker under 185 cm if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Scenario b: p = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * q (This is because if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time, and if the attacker is under 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now let's solve this system of equations:

From Scenario b, we can rearrange the equation to: 0.2 * p = 0.2 * q, which means p = q. Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, this assumption is reasonable.

Now, let's substitute p = q into Scenario a:

0.85 * p + 0.5 * p = 0.5
1.35 * p = 0.5
p â‰ˆ 0.3704 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Answer: {probability: 0.3704}
