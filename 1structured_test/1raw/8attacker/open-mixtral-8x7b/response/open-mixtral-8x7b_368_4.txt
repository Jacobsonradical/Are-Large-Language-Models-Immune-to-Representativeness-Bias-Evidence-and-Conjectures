Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% likelihood).

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which we know is a mistake 20% of the time.

Given these facts, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. This is a problem of conditional probability, which can be written as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We're given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.5 (the population is evenly split between those under and at or above 185 cm).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness is correct, and the witness is incorrect. The probability of the witness being correct is P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8)*(0.5) = 0.4. The probability of the witness being incorrect is P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.2)*(0.5) = 0.1, where A' represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, and P(A') = 0.5 because the population is evenly split.

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.5) / (0.5) = 0.8.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
