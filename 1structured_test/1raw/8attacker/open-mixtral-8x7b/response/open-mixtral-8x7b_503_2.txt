Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies height) = 0.80
P(Erroneously identifies height) = 0.20

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, we can use this to our advantage. Let's denote:

U = probability that a randomly chosen person is under 185 cm
O = probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller

Since the populations are roughly equal, U = O = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(O | Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= (0.80) * (0.50) / ((0.80) * (0.50) + (0.20) * (0.50))
= 0.80 / (0.80 + 0.10)
= 0.80 / 0.90
= 0.8889 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8889}
