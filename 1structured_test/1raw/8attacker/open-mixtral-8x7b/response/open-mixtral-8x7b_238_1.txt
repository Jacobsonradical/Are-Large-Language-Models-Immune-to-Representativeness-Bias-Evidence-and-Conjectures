To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use this information to calculate the probability:

1. The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
2. Given the witness's accuracy, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the witness erred.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
4. Therefore, to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the witness's accuracy by the prior probability (15%).

So, the estimate is:
probability = (witness's accuracy) x (prior probability)
probability = 0.8 x 0.15
probability = 0.12 (or 12% when expressed as a percentage)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is: {probability: 0.12}
