To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(tall|witness identifies tall): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(short|witness identifies tall): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(B) = 0.8 (the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
- P(B') = 0.2 (the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm with 20% accuracy)
- P(tall) = P(short) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(witness identifies tall | tall) = 1 (100% of the time, the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(witness identifies tall | short) = 0.15 (15% of the time, the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(tall|witness identifies tall):

P(tall|witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness identifies tall)

We can calculate P(witness identifies tall) as follows:
P(witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness identifies tall | short) * P(short)
= (1 * 0.5) + (0.15 * 0.5) = 0.575

Now, we can calculate P(tall|witness identifies tall):
P(tall|witness identifies tall) = (1 * 0.5) / 0.575 â‰ˆ 0.87
