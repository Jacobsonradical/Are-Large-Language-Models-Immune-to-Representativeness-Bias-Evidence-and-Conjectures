Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(not A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the sum of P(B and A) and P(B and not A):

P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.345.
