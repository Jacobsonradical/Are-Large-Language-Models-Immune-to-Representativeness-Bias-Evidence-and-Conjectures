Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This is the probability of the witness's testimony being correct.

b) Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and E represent the event of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

From the statement a), we know that P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).

From the statement b), we know that P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

We need to find P(E) to compute Bayes' theorem.

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)

We need to find P(E|not H) (the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we have:

P(E|not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(not H):

P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Finally, we can find P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)

Now, we can compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / P(E)

Please note that I cannot provide the exact value of P(E) without more information. However, we can simplify the expression for P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]

Although I cannot provide a single number as the answer, the above expression is the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. To get the actual probability, you would need to calculate the value of P(E) and use that to compute the final answer.
