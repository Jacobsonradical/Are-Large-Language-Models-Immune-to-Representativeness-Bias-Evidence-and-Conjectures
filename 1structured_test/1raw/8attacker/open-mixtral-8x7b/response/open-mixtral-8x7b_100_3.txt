Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This means that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, but there are simply more tall people overall.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and 20% error rate for such identifications.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of tall attackers and the accuracy of the witness.

P(Tall | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness report)

We know:
- P(Witness report | Tall) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(Tall) = 0.5 * 0.15 (base rate of tall attackers)
- P(Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness report | Short) * P(Short)
- P(Witness report | Short) = 0.2 * 0.85 (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, and short attackers make up 85% of the attackers)

Calculating P(Witness report):
P(Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.5 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.196

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's report:

P(Tall | Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.5 * 0.15) / 0.196 ≈ 0.6132

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6132 (or 61.32%).
