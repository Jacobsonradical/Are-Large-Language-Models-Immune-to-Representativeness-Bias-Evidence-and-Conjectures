To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights. 

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. The witness also errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller. 

We also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is a weighted average of P(B|A) and P(B|not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller.

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller).

The weighted average is:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.8 + 0.68
= 1.48

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 1.48
= 0.0806

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0806}
