To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(A), P(B|A), and P(B|not A). We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that he was identified as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the problem, we know:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = Probability that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = Probability that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller given that they are not actually 185 cm or taller = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness errs 20% of the time, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = Probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [((0.8)*(0.15)) + ((0.17)*(0.85))]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.2645
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4537

Answer: {probability: 0.4537}
