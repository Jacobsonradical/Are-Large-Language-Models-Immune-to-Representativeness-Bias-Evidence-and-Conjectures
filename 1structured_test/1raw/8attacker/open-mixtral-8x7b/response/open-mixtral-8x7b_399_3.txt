To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- S as the event that the attacker's height is under 185 cm
- T as the event that a randomly selected attacker from the population is 185 cm or taller

From information "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. So, P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(S|W) = 0.2.

From information "b", we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, P(S) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|S) * P(S)

However, we don't have information about P(W|S), the probability of the witness identifying the height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is under 185 cm. Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact probability P(A|W).

Given the information available, we cannot provide a specific estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
