Let's reason through the problem:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
2. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are taller.
3. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which they do correctly 80% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's statement (B).
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is a combination of the witness correctly identifying taller attackers and incorrectly identifying shorter attackers.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
