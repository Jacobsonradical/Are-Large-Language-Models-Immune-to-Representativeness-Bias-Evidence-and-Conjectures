To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's define two events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height.
C: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(C|A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the available information.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P'(A) = 0.85 (since P(A) + P'(A) = 1, this is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(C|A), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(C|A) = P(A|C) * P(C) / P(A)

However, we don't have P(A|C), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height correctly if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. But, since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we can assume that if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify it 80% of the time. Therefore, let's assume P(B|C) = 0.8.

Now, we can use another form of Bayes' theorem:

P(C|A) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

We already know P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(C) = 0.15. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.8 * (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

Finally, we can find P(C|A):

P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

Strictly in the required format:
{probability: 0.15}
