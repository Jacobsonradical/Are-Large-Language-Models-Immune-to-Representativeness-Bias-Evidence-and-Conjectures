To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification and the prevalence of attackers of different heights.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identified people who were 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement b, we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

In this case, A represents the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and B represents the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(not B|A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the attacker's height 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

= 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)

= 0.096 / 0.266

= 0.361 (rounded to three decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.361}
