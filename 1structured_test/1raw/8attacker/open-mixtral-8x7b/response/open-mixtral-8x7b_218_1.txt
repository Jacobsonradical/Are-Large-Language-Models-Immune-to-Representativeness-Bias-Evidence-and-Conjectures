Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter attackers are more common.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions as 80% accurate. This means that the witness is correct 4 out of 5 times for people 185 cm or taller and errs 1 out of 5 times.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time for people under 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
