To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in calculating P(C|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We have the following probabilities:
1. P(B|C) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was actually 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|~C) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03 (witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was not 185 cm or taller, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
3. P(C) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / (P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|~C) * P(~C))

First, calculate P(~C):
P(~C) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate the denominator of the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|~C) * P(~C) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.03 * 0.85) ≈ 0.138

Finally, calculate P(C|B):
P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / denominator ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.138 ≈ 0.8696

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8696}
