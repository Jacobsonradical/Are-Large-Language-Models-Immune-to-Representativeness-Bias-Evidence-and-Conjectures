To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

The witness correctly identifies people as 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate, which can be denoted as P(B|A) = 0.8, and the witness incorrectly identifies people as 185 cm or taller with a 20% failure rate, which can be denoted as P(¬B|A) = 0.2.

Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies people as shorter than 185 cm with a 20% failure rate, which can be denoted as P(B|¬A) = 0.2, and correctly identifies people as shorter than 185 cm with an 80% success rate, which can be denoted as P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

By substituting the values from above, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.4286

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4286 (or 42.86%).
