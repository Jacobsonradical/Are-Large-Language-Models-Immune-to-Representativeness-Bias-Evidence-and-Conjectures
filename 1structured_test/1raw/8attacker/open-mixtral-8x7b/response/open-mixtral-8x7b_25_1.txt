Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. However, the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, can be calculated as:
