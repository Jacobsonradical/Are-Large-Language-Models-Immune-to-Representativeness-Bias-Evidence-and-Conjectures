To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From statement "a", we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

From statement "b", we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(not A), which is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm. Since the population distribution is roughly equal, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of observing the given evidence. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
