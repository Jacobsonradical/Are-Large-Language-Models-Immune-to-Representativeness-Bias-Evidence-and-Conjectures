To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. If the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we know that:
- In 80% of the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify the height.
- In 20% of the cases where the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify the height.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that:
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the witness's accuracy when identifying attackers who are shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
