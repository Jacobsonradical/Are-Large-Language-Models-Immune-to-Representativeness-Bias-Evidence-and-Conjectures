Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80%. We also know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We know P(B|A) is 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person), and P(A) is 0.15 (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller). We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) is 0.8 and P(A) is 0.15. P(not A) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(B|not A) is the probability of incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. Plugging in these values:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
