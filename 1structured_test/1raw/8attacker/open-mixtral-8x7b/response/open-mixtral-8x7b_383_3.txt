Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This suggests that even though there are many people of this height, they are less likely to be attackers.

Next, we have the testimony of the witness. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs in 20% of the cases. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness might say the person is 185 cm or taller even if they are not.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. We need to account for both the base rate of such attackers in the population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(W|A) = 0.8, and P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases where the person is not 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A), the probability that a random attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Then, calculate the denominator of the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138
