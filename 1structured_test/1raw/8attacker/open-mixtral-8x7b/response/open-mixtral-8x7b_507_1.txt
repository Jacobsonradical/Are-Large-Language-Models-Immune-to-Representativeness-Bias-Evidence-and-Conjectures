To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's height)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the distribution of attackers' heights:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the distribution of attackers' heights)

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We are given P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. We also know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5.

To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm), we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.22 = 0.08 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
