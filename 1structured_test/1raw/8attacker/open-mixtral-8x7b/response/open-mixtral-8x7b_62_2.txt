Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can express this as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness identified as 185 cm) = P(witness identifies correctly) * P(attacker is 185 cm) + P(witness errs) * P(attacker is not 185 cm)

We are given:
P(witness identifies correctly) = 0.8
P(witness errs) = 0.2
P(attacker is 185 cm) = 0.15 (from point a)
P(attacker is not 185 cm) = 0.85 (from point a)

Substituting these values into the equation:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness identified as 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(attacker is 185 cm | witness identified as 185 cm) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(attacker is 185 cm | witness identified as 185 cm) = 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.
