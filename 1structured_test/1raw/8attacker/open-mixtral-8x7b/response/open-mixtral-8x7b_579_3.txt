To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
