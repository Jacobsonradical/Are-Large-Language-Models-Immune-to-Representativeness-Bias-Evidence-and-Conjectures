Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, we need to consider that the witness could also incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. We know that the witness errs in 20% of cases, so the probability of them identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let's denote the probability we want to find as P(A), which stands for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, P(A) is either 0.15 (if the attacker is randomly chosen from the general population) or the height was correctly identified by the witness, which has a probability of 0.8.

We also know that the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2. Let's denote this as P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We have all the values we need except for P(B|A). Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.096 / 0.266
P(A|B) = 0.361344537815

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.361344537815}
