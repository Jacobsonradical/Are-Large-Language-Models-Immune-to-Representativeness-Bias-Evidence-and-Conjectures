To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness identified correctly) = 0.80
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
