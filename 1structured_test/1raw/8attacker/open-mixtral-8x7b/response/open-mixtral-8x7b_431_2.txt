Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height. Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such. This is a conditional probability problem and can be solved using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's find P(B|A): the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's correct identification rate, 0.80.

Now, let's find P(A): the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size, we can assume this probability to be 0.50.

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(Correct ID) * P(A) + P(Incorrect ID) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50)
P(B) = 0.60

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60
P(A|B) = 0.6667 or approximately 0.67 (67%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 67%.
