Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. Let's denote this probability as P(W|T), where W is the event of the witness identifying the correct height and T is the event of the person being 185 cm or taller.

So, P(W|T) = 0.8

However, we want to find the probability of the person being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, which is P(T|W). We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

To calculate this, we still need to find P(T), the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, and P(W|F), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Since the population is roughly equal in size for those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller, P(T) = 0.5.

The probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, P(W|F), can be calculated as the product of the probability of the person being shorter than 185 cm, P(F) = 0.5, and the error rate of the witness, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. So, P(W|F) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

Now we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.1 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.05) = 0.933 (93.3%)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 93.3%.
