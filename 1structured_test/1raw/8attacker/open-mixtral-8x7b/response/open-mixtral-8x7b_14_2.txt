To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from statement "a")
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from statement "b")
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now, we can calculate the probability:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.41
â‰ˆ 0.293

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.293}.
