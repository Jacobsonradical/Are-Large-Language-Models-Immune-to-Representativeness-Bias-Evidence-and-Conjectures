Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. Let's denote this probability as P(W|T), where W represents the event of a correct identification by the witness and T represents the event that the person is 185 cm or taller.

We also know that the population is evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(T) = 0.5 and P(U) = 0.5, where U represents the event of a person being under 185 cm.

The witness also errs 20% of the time. Thus, the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually under 185 cm, denoted as P(W|U), is 20% or 0.2.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|U) * P(U)]

Substituting the given and calculated values, we have:

P(T|W) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(T|W) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(T|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(T|W) = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
