Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can infer that the witness will be correct 80% of the time, and err 20% of the time. 

However, since the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, we're interested in the probability that the witness is correct in this case. 

The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually under 185 cm is 20%. 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.8}
