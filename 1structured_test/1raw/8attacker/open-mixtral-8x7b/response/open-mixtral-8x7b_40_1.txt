Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this witness.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. 

Let's assume that there are two possibilities: the attacker is either under 185 cm (A) or 185 cm or taller (B). 

The witness said the attacker is B, which happens to be correct with 80% probability and erroneous with 20% probability. 

We want to find P(B|witness says B) = P(witness says B|B) * P(B) / [P(witness says B|B) * P(B) + P(witness says B|A) * P(A)]

We know P(witness says B|B) = 0.8, P(witness says B|A) = 0.2 (error rate), and P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (equal population).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B|witness says B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 0.6 = 1.3333, which is not a valid probability (should be between 0 and 1).

This means that there is a mistake in the problem statement or our interpretation of it. The given data does not seem to support a valid probability estimation. As it stands, we cannot provide a reasonable estimate given the provided information.
