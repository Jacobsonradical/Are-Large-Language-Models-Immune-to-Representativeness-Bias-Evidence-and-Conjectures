Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm and taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that taller people are overrepresented as attackers.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. From the problem, we have P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is under 185 cm. Denote P(¬A) as the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm. Then, P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm). For the case where the attacker is under 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
