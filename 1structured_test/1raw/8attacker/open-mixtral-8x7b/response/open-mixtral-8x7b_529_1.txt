Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This suggests that, despite the general population having an equal split of heights, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

Now let's consider the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is a case of posterior probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate it.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is not. 

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From the problem, we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time when the person is not. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 = 0.12 / 0.2645 = 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information available, is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
