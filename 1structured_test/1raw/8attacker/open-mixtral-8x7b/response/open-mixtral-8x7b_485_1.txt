Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This indicates that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller under these conditions, we can use the formula for posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a tall attacker)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between tall and short people)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is tall and where the attacker is short.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall)
P(not A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between tall and short people)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.667 (or 66.7%).
