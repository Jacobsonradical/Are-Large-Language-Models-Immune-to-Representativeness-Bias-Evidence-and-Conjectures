Let's break down the information given:

a) Even though the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm and above, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm and above. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b) A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate with a 20% error rate.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and their ability to judge height. 

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (in this case, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability of B (in this case, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(B|A) from part b) of the information provided, which is 0.8 (80%).

We know that P(A) is 0.15 (15%) because the information states that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness is correct and the witness is incorrect. The total probability of B is the sum of these two scenarios.

P(B) = P(B and correct) + P(B and incorrect)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.345 (or 34.5%).
