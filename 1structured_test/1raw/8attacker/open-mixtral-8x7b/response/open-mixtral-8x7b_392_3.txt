Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8, which is the probability of a true positive. The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2, which is the probability of a false positive.

b) The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

We are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H) given the observation (O) that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|O) = P(O|H) * P(H) / P(O)

We are given P(O|H) = 0.8 (probability of a true positive) and P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller).

However, we are missing P(O), the total probability of the observation. To calculate P(O), we need to consider both true positives and false positives.

P(O) = P(O|H) * P(H) + P(O|~H) * P(~H)

We are given P(O|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(O|~H) (probability of a false positive) as follows:

P(O|~H) = 1 - P(~O|~H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness never identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm when they actually are)

We are also given P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(O):

P(O) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|O):

P(H|O) = P(O|H) * P(H) / P(O) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
