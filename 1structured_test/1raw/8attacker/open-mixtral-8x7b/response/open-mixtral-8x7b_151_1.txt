To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's define two events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A): The population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to the population of people shorter than 185 cm. So, we can assume that P(A) = 0.5.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To compute P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.5
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Now we need P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, the witness will err 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can compute P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 4 / 3 * 0.5 = 0.6667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.6667}
