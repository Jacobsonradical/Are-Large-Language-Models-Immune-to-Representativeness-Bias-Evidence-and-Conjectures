To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such with 80% probability (P(B|A) = 0.8) and errs with 20% probability (P(B'|A) = 0.2), where B' is the event that the witness fails to identify an 185 cm or taller person as such.

Similarly, for people under 185 cm, the witness fails to identify them as such with 20% probability (P(B|B') = 0.2) and correctly identifies them as under 185 cm with 80% probability (P(B'|B') = 0.8).

From statement (b), we know that the proportion of such attackers who are under 185 cm is 85% (P(B') = 0.85), and thus, the proportion who are 185 cm or taller is 15% (P(A) = 0.15).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence.

First, we calculate P(B), the probability of observing the evidence. This is given by:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|B') * P(B')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
