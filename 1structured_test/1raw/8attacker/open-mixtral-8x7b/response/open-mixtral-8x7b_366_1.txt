To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We know that the witness correctly identified people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. We also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A) given the information above.

From the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we can use Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(A | witness identifies taller) = P(witness identifies taller | A) * P(A) / P(witness identifies taller)

We are given that P(witness identifies taller | A) = 0.8 (80% correct identification rate) and P(A) is what we want to find.

To find P(witness identifies taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identifies taller) = P(witness identifies taller | A) * P(A) + P(witness identifies taller | not A) * P(not A)

We are given that P(witness identifies taller | A) = 0.8, and since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now we need to find P(witness identifies taller | not A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller when the attacker is actually not taller than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are not taller, P(witness identifies taller | not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can find P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(A | witness identifies taller) * P(witness identifies taller) / P(witness identifies taller | A)
= (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17 * 0.85)

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.17 / (0.17 + 0.14 * P(A))

Rearranging the terms, we get:

P(A) - 0.14 * P(A) = 0.17
0.86 * P(A) = 0.17
P(A) = 0.17 / 0.86 â‰ˆ 0.1977 (19.77%)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 19.77%.
