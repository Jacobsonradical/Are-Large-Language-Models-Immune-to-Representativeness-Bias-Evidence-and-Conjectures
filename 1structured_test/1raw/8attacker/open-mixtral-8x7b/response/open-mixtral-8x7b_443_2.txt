To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): Probability that the witness does not identify a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller
- P(A'|B): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B'|A') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time, meaning they fail 20% of the time, or erroneously identify a person as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A'))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.517

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.517 or 51.7%.
