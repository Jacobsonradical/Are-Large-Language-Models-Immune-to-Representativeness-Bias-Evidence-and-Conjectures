To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(F): probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(E) = 0.8
P(F) = 0.2
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(A)
P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(A)
P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(B | A)
P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = P(B | NOT A)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(A | B)

From the problem, we know that P(B | A) = P(E) = 0.8 and P(B | NOT A) = P(F) = 0.2.

We need to find P(A | B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / (P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | NOT A) * P(NOT A))

To find P(A | B), we need to know P(A), the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, it means that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(A | B):
P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / (P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | NOT A) * P(NOT A))
P(A | B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A | B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.36 (or 36%).
