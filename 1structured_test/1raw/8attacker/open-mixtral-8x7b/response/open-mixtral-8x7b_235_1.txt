To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights. We will use Bayes' theorem to combine these probabilities.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = Witness accuracy when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the distribution of attackers' heights.
P(B|¬A) = Witness accuracy when the person is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
P(¬A) = Prior probability of the attacker NOT being 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85 based on the distribution of attackers' heights.

We want to find P(A|B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
