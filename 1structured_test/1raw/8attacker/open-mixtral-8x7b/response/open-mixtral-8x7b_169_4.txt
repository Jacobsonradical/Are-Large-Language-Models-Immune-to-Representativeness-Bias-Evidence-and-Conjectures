To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(B) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) as the probability that a witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
P(A|B) as the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A' and B) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, this happens 20% of the time and there is a 50% chance of the person actually being shorter)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

First, calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6 (60%)

Now, calculate P(A|B)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.67 (67%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.67.
