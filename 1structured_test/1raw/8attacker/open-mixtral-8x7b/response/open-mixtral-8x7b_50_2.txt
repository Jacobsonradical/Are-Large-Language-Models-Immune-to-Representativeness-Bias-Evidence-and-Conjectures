Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies height) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies height) = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

Now, let's calculate the probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as shorter:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter) = P(Witness identified as shorter | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter) * P(Witness identified as shorter)
= 0.4 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.145.
