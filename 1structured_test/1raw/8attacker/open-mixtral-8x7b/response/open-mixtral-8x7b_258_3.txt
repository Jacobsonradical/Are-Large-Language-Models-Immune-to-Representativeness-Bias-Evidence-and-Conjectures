To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the general population and the witness's ability to judge height.

Let's denote:
- P(SH) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(T) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|SH) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

From the information provided, we know that:
P(SH) = P(T) = 0.5
P(W|T) = 0.8
P(W|SH) = 0.2

We want to estimate P(T|W), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|SH) * P(SH)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

Now, compute the above expression:

P(T|W) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
