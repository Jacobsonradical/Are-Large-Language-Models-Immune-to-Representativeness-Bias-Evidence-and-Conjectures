To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- P(S) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(W|S) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(T) = P(S) = 0.5 (because the population is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(W|S) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time)

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller: P(T|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)]

Plug in the values, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

After simplifying, we find that:

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
