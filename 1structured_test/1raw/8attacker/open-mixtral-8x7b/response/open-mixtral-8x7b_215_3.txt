To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). Then, we want to find P(A) given the witness's observation. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|observation) = P(observation|A) * P(A) / P(observation)

We want to find P(A|observation). However, without additional information, we cannot directly calculate P(observation). Instead, we can calculate the ratio of P(A|observation) and P(not A|observation) using the following:

P(observation|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A|observation) = P(observation|not A) * P(not A)
P(observation|not A) = 1 - P(not observation|not A) = 1 - 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.98 (the witness either correctly identifies the attacker as under 185 cm or erroneously identifies an attacker under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is under 185 cm)

Thus,

P(observation|not A) * P(not A) = 0.98 * 0.85 = 0.838

Now, we can calculate the ratio of P(A|observation) and P(not A|observation):

P(A|observation) / P(not A|observation) = 0.8 * P(A) / 0.838

Since the probabilities of all heights should sum to 1, we have:

P(A) = 1 - P(not A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Substituting this into the equation above, we get:

0.8 * 0.15 / 0.838 = 0.139

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.139}
