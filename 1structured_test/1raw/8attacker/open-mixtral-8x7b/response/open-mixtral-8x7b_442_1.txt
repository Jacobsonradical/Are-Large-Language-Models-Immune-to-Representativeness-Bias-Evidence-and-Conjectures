Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. However, since the witness can also make mistakes, we need to account for the error rate of 20%, or 0.2.

The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows:

P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)
+ P(Identified as shorter | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)

Given that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time, we have:

P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.2) * 0.15
= 0.12 + 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.15
= 0.39

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.39.

Answer: {probability: 0.39}
