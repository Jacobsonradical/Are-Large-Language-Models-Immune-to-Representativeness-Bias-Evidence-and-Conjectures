To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. This means that, on average, the witness's identification has an 80% true positive rate and a 20% false positive rate.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A multiplied by the prior probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and let event B be the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability of event A given event B, or P(A|B).

We know that P(B|A) is the witness's true positive rate, which is 80%. We also know that P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

To find the probability of event B, we need to consider both the true positive rate and the false positive rate. The probability of event B is equal to the probability of a true positive plus the probability of a false positive. In this case, the probability of a true positive is P(B|A) \* P(A), or 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of a false positive is P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A), where ¬A is the complement of A, or the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm. The probability of ¬A is 85%, and the witness's false positive rate is 20%, so the probability of a false positive is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability of event B is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
