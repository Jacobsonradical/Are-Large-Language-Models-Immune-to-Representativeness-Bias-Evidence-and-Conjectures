To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief about the probability of an event based on evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller". 
Event B is "the observed data based on the witness report and population statistics".

From the given information, we have:
P(B|A) = Witness accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
P(A) = Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from part b)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two mutually exclusive cases - when the attacker's height is less than 185 cm and when it is 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From part (a), the witness was correct 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, hence P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.80 * 0.50 = 0.70
And P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

So, P(B and not A) = 0.70 * 0.85
Therefore, P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.70 * 0.85 = 0.685

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.685 â‰ˆ 0.175

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.175 (or 17.5%).
