Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct identification) = 0.8
P(incorrect identification) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume a 50/50 chance of the attacker's height being under or over 185 cm.

We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(taller | identification) = P(identification | taller) * P(taller) / P(identification)

We want to find P(taller | identification), and we know P(identification | taller) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller), and P(taller) = 0.5 (the base rate probability of a person being 185 cm or taller).

We need to calculate P(identification), which is the sum of probabilities for both correct identification and incorrect identification.

P(identification) = P(identification | taller) * P(taller) + P(identification | shorter) * P(shorter)
P(identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(taller | identification):

P(taller | identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.6667

Answer: {probability: 0.6667}
