Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate when the population is evenly split between those under and over 185 cm, and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness's accuracy implies that there's an 80% chance that they correctly identified the attacker's height and a 20% chance that they erred. 

Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we're interested in the 80% probability event. 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
