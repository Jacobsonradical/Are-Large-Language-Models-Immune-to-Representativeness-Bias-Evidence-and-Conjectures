To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. We know that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone as shorter 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that their assessment is correct.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that even though the population may be roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the witness's accuracy (0.8) by the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (0.15). This gives us:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
