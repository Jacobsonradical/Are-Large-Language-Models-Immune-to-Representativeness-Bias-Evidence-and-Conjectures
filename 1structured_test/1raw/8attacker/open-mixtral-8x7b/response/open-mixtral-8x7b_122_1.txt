To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is taller or equal to 185 cm)

Next, we need to account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can do this by calculating the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification:

P(Taller) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness Identified Taller)

We need to calculate P(Witness Identified Taller). Since there are two types of people, we can calculate the probabilities for both and sum them up:

P(Witness Identified Taller) = P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness Identified Taller | Shorter) * P(Shorter)
P(Witness Identified Taller) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.25 + 0.17 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness Identified Taller)
P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = (0.8)*(0.15) / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2857 or 28.57%.
