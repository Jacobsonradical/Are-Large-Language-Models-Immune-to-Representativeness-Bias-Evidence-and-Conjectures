Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, but taller people are still a significant minority.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the known error rates.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 80% (the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker as tall)
- P(A) = 15% (the general population proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller)

However, we are not directly given P(B), the overall probability that a witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We know:
- P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
- P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are not directly given P(not A), the general population proportion of attackers shorter than 185 cm. However, since the general population is roughly evenly split between people shorter and taller than 185 cm, we can estimate that P(not A) = 0.5 (or 50%).

We are also not directly given P(B|not A), the probability that a witness identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller. However, we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying tall attackers and errs 20% of the time. Since the error rate is 20%, we can estimate that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (or 20%).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.1
P(B) = 0.22 (or 22%)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5455 (or 54.55%)

Therefore, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 54.55%.
