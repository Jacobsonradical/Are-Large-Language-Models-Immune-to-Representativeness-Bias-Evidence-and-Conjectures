Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% chance) than 185 cm or taller (15% chance).

Now, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This witness is correct 80% of the time when judging a person's height and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's identification (B).

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (20%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we want to find.
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which we can estimate as 0.55 (55%) based on the information that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.55)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
