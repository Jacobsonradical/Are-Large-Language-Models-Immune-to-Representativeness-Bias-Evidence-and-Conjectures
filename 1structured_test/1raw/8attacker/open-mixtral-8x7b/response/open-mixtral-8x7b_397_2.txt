To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event based on evidence.

Let's define:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- C as the evidence that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the distribution of attacker heights in the population.

First, we calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies such a person 80% of the time. Hence, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we calculate P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). According to the given information, the witness errs 20% of the time in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is the sum of identifying correctly and erring, hence P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). However, without knowing the prior probability P(A), we cannot calculate P(B).

Therefore, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given only the provided information. However, since P(not A) is the majority (85%), it is more likely that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller. But without knowing the exact prior probabilities, we cannot quantify this statement.

In the requested format, I would answer: {probability: cannot be determined without additional information}.
