Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. So, the probability is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the person is shorter than 185 cm). The witness errs in 20% of the cases. Since 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the product of these two probabilities gives us the probability of the witness identifying a person shorter than 1
