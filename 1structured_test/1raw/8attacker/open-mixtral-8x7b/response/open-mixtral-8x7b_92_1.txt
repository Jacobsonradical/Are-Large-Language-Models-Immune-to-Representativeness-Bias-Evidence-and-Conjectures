To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)].

First, calculate P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Next, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
