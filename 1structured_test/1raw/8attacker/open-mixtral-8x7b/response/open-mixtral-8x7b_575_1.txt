Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that it's roughly evenly split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, in the group of attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, which is much higher than 50%. This suggests that being 185 cm or taller might be relatively rare among attackers.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if a person is 185 cm or taller but incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is a piece of evidence supporting this hypothesis. However, we also need to take into account the witness's error rate. If the actual distribution of attacker heights were the same as the general population (50-50), then given the witness's error rate, we would expect them to incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller about 20% of the time.

However, we know that the distribution of attacker heights is skewed towards shorter individuals. So even though the witness might have a 20% chance of being wrong overall, the chance of them being wrong when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller could be higher because there are fewer tall attackers to begin with.

Without specific numbers for the distribution of attacker heights, we can't provide a precise numerical estimate. But based on the information given, it seems more likely that the witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, simply because the witness has more success identifying taller individuals than shorter ones. But without further information, it's hard to give a definitive probability.

{probability: Cannot provide a precise numerical estimate without more information, but the probability seems higher than 0.5 based on the provided information}
