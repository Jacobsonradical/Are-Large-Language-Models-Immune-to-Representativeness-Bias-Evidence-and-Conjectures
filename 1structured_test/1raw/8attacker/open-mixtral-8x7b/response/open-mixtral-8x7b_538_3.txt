Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(identified as shorter than 185 cm | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller)
                                         + P(identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(actually shorter than 185 cm | identified as 185 cm or taller)
                                         = (0.8 * P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller))
                                         + (0.2 * P(actually shorter than 185 cm | identified as 185 cm or taller))

Since we're looking for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't know the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(identified as 185 cm or taller). To find this probability, we can use the information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Thus, we have:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
                                                 + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
                                                 = (0.15 * 1) + (0.85 * 0.2)
                                                 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 1) + (0.2 * 0.32) = 0.8 + 0.064 = 0.864

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.864}
