To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- q as the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm (which is also q = 1 - p)
- w as the accuracy of the witness (0.8 for correct identification and 0.2 for errors)

We know that the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than or equal to 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. This means that the probability of an attacker being under 185 cm is 0.85, so q = 0.85. Therefore, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now, we need to account for the accuracy of the witness. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:

P(p | w) = P(w | p) * P(p) / P(w)

We don't have information about P(w), so we can't compute the exact probability. However, we can simplify the expression to:

P(p | w) = P(w | p) * P(p) / [P(w | p) * P(p) + P(w | q) * P(q)]

We know that P(p) = 0.15, P(q) = 0.85, P(w | p) = 0.8, and P(w | q) = 0.2 (witness error rate). So we can compute:

P(p | w) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.375

However, since we don't have information about P(w), we cannot provide an exact answer. But we have used the available information to arrive at a probability range:

0.375 ≤ P(p | w) ≤ 0.8

So, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is between 0.375 and 0.8. However, without information about P(w), we cannot give a more precise answer.
