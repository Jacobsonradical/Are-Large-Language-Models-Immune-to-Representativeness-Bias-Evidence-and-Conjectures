Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, yet 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to be attackers in this population.

b. A witness has identified the attacker as being at/above 185 cm, with a reliability of 80% for this type of identification.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want to find the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as at/above 185 cm, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being at/above 185 cm, which is 15% or 0.15 based on part a.
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as at/above 185 cm, which is a combination of the witness correctly identifying people at/above 185 cm and incorrectly identifying people below 185 cm as being at/above 185 cm.

P(B) = [P(B and A)] + [P(B and not A)]
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]
= 0.12 + 0.16
= 0.28

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28
= 0.12 / 0.28
â‰ˆ 0.42857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.43 (or 43%).
