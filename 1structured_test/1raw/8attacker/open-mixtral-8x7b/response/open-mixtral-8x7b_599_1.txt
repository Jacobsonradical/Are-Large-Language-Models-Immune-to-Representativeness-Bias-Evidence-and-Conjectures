Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement a), we know that P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

From statement b), we know that P(A) is the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the case where the attacker is under 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From statement a), we know that P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2. And from statement b), we know that P(not A) is the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being under 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
