To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness's reports of a person being 185 cm or taller can be considered as having a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.8 and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.2.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prevalence (pre) of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Using these probabilities, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using the following formula:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A))

where:

* P(A|W) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's report
* P(W|A) is the true positive rate (TPR) of the witness's report
* P(A) is the prevalence (pre) of attackers who are 185 cm or taller
* P(W|not A) is the false positive rate (FPR) of the witness's report
* P(not A) is the prevalence (1-pre) of attackers who are not 185 cm or taller

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
