Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

a. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that attackers are more likely to be shorter than taller.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(¬B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

From the problem statement, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), and the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the attackers who are shorter than 185 cm are more likely (85%), we can assume that P(B|¬A) is greater than 0.

To estimate P(B|¬A), we can use the witness's error rate of 20%: P(¬B|A) = 0.2. Since there are twice as many attackers who are shorter than 185 cm, we can assume that the witness is more likely to make an error in this direction. Therefore, we can estimate P(B|¬A) as being less than 0.2, let's say 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * (1 - 0.15)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.57

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.57}
