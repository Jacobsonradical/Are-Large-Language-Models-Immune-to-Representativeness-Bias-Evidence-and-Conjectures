Given the information provided, let's denote:

A: The event that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
C: The event that the person is one of the 15% of attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(B) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).

However, we are not directly given information about P(B|C), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they are one of the 15% of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. To find this, we need to use the information provided that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller: P(C) = 0.15.

Since we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, and we assume the heights are distributed equally among attackers, we can infer that P(B|C) = 1 (given that someone is an attacker in the 185 cm or taller group, they are definitely 185 cm or taller).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(B|A), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

To find P(A), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (event A and B), or the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they were actually shorter than 185 cm (event A and not B).

P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)
= P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)
= (0.8) * (0.5) + (0.2) * (0.5)
= 0.6

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is:

{probability: 0.25, "The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.25."}
