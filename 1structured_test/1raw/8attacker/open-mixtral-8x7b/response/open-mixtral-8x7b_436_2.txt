To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From statement (a), we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

From statement (b), we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

What we need is P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since the attacker can either be 185 cm or taller, or shorter than that, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
