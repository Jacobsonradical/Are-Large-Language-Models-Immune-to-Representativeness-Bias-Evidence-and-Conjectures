Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them making an error:

P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Error | Not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height. Therefore:

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.5
P(Not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(185 cm or taller) = 0.5

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness's identification given the attacker's actual height. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identification)

We need to calculate P(Witness identification):

P(Witness identification) = P(Witness identification and 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identification and Not 185 cm or taller)

Using the law of total probability:

P(Witness identification) = P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identification | Not 185 cm or taller) * P(Not 185 cm or taller)

Calculating the terms:

P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Witness identification | Not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Error | Not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Substituting these values:

P(Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.8 * 0.5) = 0.8

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identification)
P(185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.8 = 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
