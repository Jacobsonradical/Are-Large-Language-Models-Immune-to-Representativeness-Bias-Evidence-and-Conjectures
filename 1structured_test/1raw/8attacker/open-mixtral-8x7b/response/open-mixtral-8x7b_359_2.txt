To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's assume that the general population has N people, half of whom are shorter than 185 cm and half are 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the witness's accuracy. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller AND the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Correctly identified as 185 cm or taller AND height is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct identification) * P(Height is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.80 * 0.15
= 0.12

Next, we'll calculate the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, but the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller (a false positive):

P(False positive) = P(Incorrect identification) * P(Height is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.20 * 0.50
= 0.10

Finally, we'll calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(Height is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = P(Correct identification) * P(Height is 185 cm or taller) / (P(Correct identification) * P(Height is 185 cm or taller) + P(False positive) * P(Height is not 185 cm or taller))
= (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.10)
= 0.5455 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.5455.
