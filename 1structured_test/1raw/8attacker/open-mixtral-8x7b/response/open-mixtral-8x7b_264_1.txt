To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

Now, let's find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly or incorrectly, given the attacker's height:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B'|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

P(B'|A') = 0.15 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|A') = 0.85 (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A), so we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(A and B) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')

Find P(B and A):
P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A)

Solve for P(A):
P(A) = P(B and A) / P(B)
P(A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'))

We know the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|A') = 0.85
P(A') = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size)

So,
P(A) = 0.8 \* P(A) / (0.8 \* P(A) + 0.85 \* 0.5)

0.2 \* P(A) = 0.425 \* 0.5

P(A) = 1.0625 / 2.1

Now, we need to round P(A) to the nearest probability between 0 and 1.
