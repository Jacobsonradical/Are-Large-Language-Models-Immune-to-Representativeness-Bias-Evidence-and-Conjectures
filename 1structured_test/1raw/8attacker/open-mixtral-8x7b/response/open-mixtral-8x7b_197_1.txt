Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under these conditions is assessed to be correct 80% of the time, but they err 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy rate for this is 80%, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

{probability: 0.8}
