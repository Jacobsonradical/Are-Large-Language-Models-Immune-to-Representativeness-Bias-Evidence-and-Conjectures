Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers compared to their proportion in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from point a).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (from point b).
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% (from point a, since 85% of attackers are below this height).
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% (from point b).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / ((0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
