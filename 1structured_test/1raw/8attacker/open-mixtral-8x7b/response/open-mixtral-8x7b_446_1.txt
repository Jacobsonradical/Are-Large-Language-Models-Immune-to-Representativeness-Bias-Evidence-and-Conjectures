Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Next, we consider the attacker's height. The population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, leaving 15% at or above 185 cm.

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker = 185 cm | Witness ID) = [P(Witness ID | Attacker = 185 cm) * P(Attacker = 185 cm)] / P(Witness ID)

We need to calculate P(Witness ID). Since the total probability for the witness's identifications should sum to 1, we can calculate the complement of the incorrect identification:

P(Witness ID) = 1 - P(Incorrect ID) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Now we can plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker = 185 cm | Witness ID) = [(0.80 * 0.15) / 0.80] = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
