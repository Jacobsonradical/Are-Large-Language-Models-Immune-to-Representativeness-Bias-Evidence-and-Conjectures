To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(A|B): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such

From the information provided, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B'|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 0.15 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate it as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - P(B'|A')) * (1 - 0.15)
      = (0.12) + (0.85 * 0.85)
      = 0.12 + 0.7225
      = 0.8425

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8425)
      = 0.12 / 0.8425
      ≈ 0.1424

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use the same formula as above but with different notations:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We already have the values for P(B|A) and P(A), and we calculated P(B) earlier. So,

P(A|B) ≈ 0.1424 / 0.8425
      ≈ 0.1687

But this value is not within the range of 0 to 1 as requested. The reason for this is the relatively low accuracy of the witness (0.8) and the low probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15). In such cases, the witness's identification might not provide a strong basis for estimating the attacker's height.
