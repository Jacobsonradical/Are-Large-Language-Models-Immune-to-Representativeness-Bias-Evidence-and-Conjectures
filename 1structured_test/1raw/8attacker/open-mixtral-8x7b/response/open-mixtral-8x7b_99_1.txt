To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We know that the witness correctly identified people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, this means that the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller is 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075, or 7.5%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185+ | witness) = P(witness | 185+) * P(185+) / P(witness)

We know that P(witness | 185+) = 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate), P(185+) = 0.075 (the base rate), and P(witness) is the total probability of the witness's identification, which can be calculated as:

P(witness) = P(witness | 185+) * P(185+) + P(witness | <185) * P(<185)

Since the witness is equally likely to make an error for people shorter or taller than 185 cm, we have P(witness | <185) = 1 - P(witness | 185+) = 0.2. Since 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(<185) = 0.5. Therefore, we have:

P(witness) = 0.8 * 0.075 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.15 + 0.10 = 0.25

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(185+ | witness) = 0.8 * 0.075 / 0.25 = 0.06 / 0.25 = 0.24

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.24}
