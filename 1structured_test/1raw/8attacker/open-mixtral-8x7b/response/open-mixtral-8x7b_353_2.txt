Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population where people of different heights are equally distributed. According to point "a", 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. The fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller in a 50-50 population distribution implies that people who are 185 cm or taller are disproportionately more likely to be attackers.

Next, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height correctly as described in point "b". The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying whether a person is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's combine these two pieces of information to estimate the probability of the attacker's height. We know that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
