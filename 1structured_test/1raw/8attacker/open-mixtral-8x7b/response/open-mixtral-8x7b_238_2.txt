Given the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
2. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness report)

We have the following probabilities:
- P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(Witness report | Tall) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
- P(Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness report | Short) * P(Short)

However, we don't have information about P(Witness report | Short), which is the probability of the witness reporting a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm. Due to this missing information, we cannot provide an accurate estimate of the probability.
