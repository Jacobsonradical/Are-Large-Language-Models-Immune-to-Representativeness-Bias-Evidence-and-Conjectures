To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller
- q as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, so q = 1 - p
- w as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- e as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not

From the given information, we know that p is roughly equal to q. Also, we are told that w = 0.8 and e = 0.2.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm | witness identifies 185 cm) = P(witness identifies 185 cm | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness identifies 185 cm)

Using the given values and applying Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm | witness identifies 185 cm) = (0.8 * p) / ((0.8 * p) + (0.2 * q))

Given that p is roughly equal to q:

P(185 cm | witness identifies 185 cm) ≈ (0.8 * p) / (0.8 * p + 0.2 * p)
P(185 cm | witness identifies 185 cm) ≈ (0.8 * p) / (1 * p)
P(185 cm | witness identifies 185 cm) ≈ 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
