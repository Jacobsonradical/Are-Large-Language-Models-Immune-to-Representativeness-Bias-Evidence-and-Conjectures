To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

1) First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker:
P(Correct ID | Tall Attacker) = 0.8

2) Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(Incorrect ID | Short Attacker) = 1 - P(Correct ID | Short Attacker) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

3) Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the information about the population:
P(Tall Attacker) = 0.15

4) We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:
P(Tall Attacker | Witness ID) = P(Correct ID | Tall Attacker) * P(Tall Attacker) / P(Witness ID)

5) The probability of the witness identification can be calculated as follows:
P(Witness ID) = P(Correct ID | Tall Attacker) * P(Tall Attacker) + P(Incorrect ID | Short Attacker) * P(Short Attacker)

Now, let's calculate the probability:

P(Witness ID) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, let's calculate the final probability:

P(Tall Attacker | Witness ID) = P(Correct ID | Tall Attacker) * P(Tall Attacker) / P(Witness ID) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
