Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for such heights.

Given these conditions, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume two scenarios:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (Scenario A).
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (Scenario B).

We want to calculate the probability of Scenario A being true.

According to the witness, the probability of identifying Scenario A as true is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of identifying Scenario B as Scenario A is 0.2 (20%). Given that there are equal numbers of people in both categories, the overall probability can be calculated as follows:

P(Scenario A) = P(Scenario A | Witness identifies Scenario A) * P(Witness identifies Scenario A) + P(Scenario A | Witness identifies Scenario B) * P(Witness identifies Scenario B)

Given the provided information:

P(Witness identifies Scenario A) = 0.8 (80% correct identification rate)
P(Witness identifies Scenario B as Scenario A) = 0.2 (20% error rate)
P(Scenario A) = (0.8 * P(Scenario A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(Scenario A)))

Solving for P(Scenario A) gives us:

P(Scenario A) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
