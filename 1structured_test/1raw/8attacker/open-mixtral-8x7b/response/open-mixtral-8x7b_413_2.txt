To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we have P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(¬B|A) = 0.2, where ¬B is the event that the witness did not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "b", we have P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since the witness is always presented with an equal number of people shorter than and 185 cm or taller, the probability of guessing correctly when the person is not 185 cm or taller is also 80%. Thus, P(B|¬A) = 0.8.

Now, we can compute P(B):

P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.8) * (0.85) = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8) ≈ 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.15.
