Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. It's roughly evenly split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% versus 15%). This suggests that being tall may be negatively correlated with being an attacker.

Despite this, a witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the witness being correct 80% of the time in such judgments.

Given these factors, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness is correct 80% of the time, so the prior probability (that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is multiplied by 0.8 (80%). The remaining 20% represents the witness being incorrect, which would mean the attacker is actually under 185 cm.

However, since the general population is evenly split but attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, we need to apply a correction factor to our calculation. This factor would reduce the weight given to the witness's identification, as the attacker is more likely to be short.

Unfortunately, without more specific information about the exact distribution of attackers' heights or the size of the general population, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate. But based on the given information, we would generally increase the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller due to the witness's identification, but not as much as if the attacker population were also evenly split between short and tall.
