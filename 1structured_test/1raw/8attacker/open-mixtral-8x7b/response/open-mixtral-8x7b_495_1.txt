Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(error) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. This is a problem of conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to solve it:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We need to find P(B|A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are. This is the same as P(correct ID), which we calculated as 0.8.

We need to find P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.67 (or 67%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 67%.
