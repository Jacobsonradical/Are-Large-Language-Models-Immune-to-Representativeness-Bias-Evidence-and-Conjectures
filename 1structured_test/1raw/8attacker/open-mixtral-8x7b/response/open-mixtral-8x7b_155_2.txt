To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge height)

Next, we need to account for the fact that the witness might have erred in their identification. Since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Given that the witness's error rate is 20% and that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the second probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.87

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 and the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.87, we can calculate the overall probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.87 = 0.64 + 0.174 = 0.814

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.814}
