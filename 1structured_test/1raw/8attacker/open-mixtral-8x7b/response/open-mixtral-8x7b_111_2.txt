To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

According to statement "a", the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the witness would identify the attacker as such.

Statement "b" tells us that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to account for both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(T): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(~T): probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T): probability that the witness identifies a 185 cm or taller attacker correctly
- P(W|~T): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller

Using the given information, we have:
- P(T) = 0.15
- P(~T) = 0.85
- P(W|T) = 0.8
- P(W|~T) = 0.2

Now, we want to find the probability P(T|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|~T) * P(~T)]

Substituting the values:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the result:

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
