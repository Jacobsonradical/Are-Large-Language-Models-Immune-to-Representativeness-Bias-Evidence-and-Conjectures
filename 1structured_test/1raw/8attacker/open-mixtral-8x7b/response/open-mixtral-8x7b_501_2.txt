Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such using Bayes' theorem:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller)] / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

The term P(actually 185 cm or taller) is the prior probability, which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, this probability is 0.5:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.5

To calculate the term P(identified as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) * P(actually shorter than 185 cm)

Plug in the values:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

{probability: 0.667}
