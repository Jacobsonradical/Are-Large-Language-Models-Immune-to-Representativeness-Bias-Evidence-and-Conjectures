Let's break down the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as shorter than 185 cm is 0.8 as well.

b. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
