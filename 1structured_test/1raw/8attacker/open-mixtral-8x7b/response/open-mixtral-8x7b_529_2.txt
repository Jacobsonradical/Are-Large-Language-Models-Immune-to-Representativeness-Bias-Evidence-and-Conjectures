Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

a. We know that the population has roughly an equal number of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate when judging heights under similar conditions.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

To estimate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 80%.
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the information provided.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (A is true), with a probability of P(B|A) = 80%.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A is false), with a probability of P(B|A') = 20% (the error rate of the witness).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * (1-P(A)) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statement:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
