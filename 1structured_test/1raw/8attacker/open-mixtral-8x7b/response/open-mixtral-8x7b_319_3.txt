To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Given a person of height 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time and erroneously identify them as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
