Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability of the event "correct identification" is 0.8, and the probability of the event "incorrect identification" is 0.2.

Now, let's consider the attacker's height. According to the given data, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

However, we also have a piece of evidence - a witness identification. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is a piece of information that we can incorporate into our calculation using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let A be the event "attacker's height is 185 cm or taller", and B be the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given data, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correct identification)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrect identification, where ¬A is the event "attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller")

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|¬A) = 0.2. We also know that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm).

So,
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.345.
