Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%).
b. The witness correctly identifies a person as at/above 185 cm 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm given the witness's claim. This is a problem of conditional probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, and W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm.
We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

We can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.5 (since the population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm).

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct or the witness is incorrect.
- If the witness is correct, P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4
- If the witness is incorrect, P(W|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

So P(W) = 0.4 (witness is correct) + 0.1 (witness is incorrect) = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
