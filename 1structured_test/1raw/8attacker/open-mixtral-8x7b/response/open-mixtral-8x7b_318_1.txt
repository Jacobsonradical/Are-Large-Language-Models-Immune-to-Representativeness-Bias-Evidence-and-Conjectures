Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means the witness has a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 0.8 and a false positive rate (1 - specificity) of 0.2.

b. Out of such attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that even though the number of people below and above 185 cm is roughly equal, the proportion of attackers who are taller is much smaller.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let's denote:
- TP as true positive (the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the witness identifies it correctly)
- FP as false positive (the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, but the witness mistakenly identifies it as such)
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|TP), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|TP) = [P(TP|A) * P(A)] / [P(TP|A) * P(A) + P(TP|A') * P(A')]

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height, P(TP|A) = 0.8, P(TP|A') = 0.2, and P(A') = 1 - P(A).

Since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting these values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|TP) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.375, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.
