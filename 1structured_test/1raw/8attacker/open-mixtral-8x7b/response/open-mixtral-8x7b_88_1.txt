To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(Correct) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(Error) as the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller

From the given information:
P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We are also given the following probabilities for the witness:
P(Correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(Error) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(Correct) * P(A) + P(Error) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
probability: 0.15 or 15% (since we know that P(A) = 0.15)
