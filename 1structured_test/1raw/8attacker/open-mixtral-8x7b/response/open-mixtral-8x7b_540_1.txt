To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. We know that the witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that there is a 0.8 probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller and a 0.2 probability of mistakenly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that there is a 0.85 probability of an attacker being under 185 cm and a 0.15 probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

To find P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | under 185 cm) * P(under 185 cm)

We are given that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15. We also know that P(under 185 cm) = 0.85 and that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | under 185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Putting this all together, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17) = 0.36 / 0.53 â‰ˆ 0.68

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.68.
