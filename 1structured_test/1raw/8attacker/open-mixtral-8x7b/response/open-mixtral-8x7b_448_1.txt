To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find: P(A|B)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
      = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
      ≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
