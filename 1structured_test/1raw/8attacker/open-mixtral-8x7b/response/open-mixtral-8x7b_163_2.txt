Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From part (a), we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

From part (b), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height, so P(B|A) = 0.8. Similarly, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when judging height, so P(B'|A') = 0.2, where A' is the complement of A, representing the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than and at least 185 cm tall, we also know that P(B'|A') ≈ P(B|A'), meaning the witness is equally likely to incorrectly identify someone as being 185 cm or taller, whether they actually are or not.

Now we can calculate P(A'|B), the probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A'|B) = P(B|A') * P(A') / (P(B|A') * P(A') + P(B|A) * P(A))
= 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15)
≈ 0.2045

Finally, to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we calculate P(A|B) = 1 - P(A'|B):

P(A|B) = 1 - P(A'|B)
= 1 - 0.2045
≈ 0.7955

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7955 (or 79.55%).
