Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
P(falsely identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

Let's denote the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller as H and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W. We want to find the probability P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to the information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, the witness only identifies people correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability we're looking for is:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We know P(W|H) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller) and P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(W), we need to consider both the true positives and false positives. In this case, the true positives are the 15% of attackers who are actually 185 cm or taller and are correctly identified as such by the witness. The false positives are the 85% of attackers who are not 185 cm or taller, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as such.

P(W) = P(W ∩ H) + P(W ∩ H')
= P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|H') * P(H')
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
