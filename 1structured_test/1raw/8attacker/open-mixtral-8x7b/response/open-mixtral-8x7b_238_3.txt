Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in these values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.2818 or 28.18%.
