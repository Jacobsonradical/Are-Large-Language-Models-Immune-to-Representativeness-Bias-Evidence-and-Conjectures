Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness will identify them correctly, and if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as such.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Now let's calculate:

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
       = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(B|A), P(A), and P(not A) (which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85) but we need to find P(B|not A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, we can calculate P(B|not A) as follows:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time) * 0.85 (85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller) = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
          = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
          = 0.12 + 0.1445
          = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
           = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2645
           = 0.12 / 0.2645
           = 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4535.

Answer: {probability: 0.4535}
