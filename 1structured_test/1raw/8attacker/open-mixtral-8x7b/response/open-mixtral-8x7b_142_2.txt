To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated as:
