Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that shorter people may be more aggressive or involved in more attacks, but it doesn't necessarily reflect the overall population.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases. Therefore, given this specific witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller would be 0.8, or 80%.

However, it's important to note that this calculation is based on the assumption that the witness's ability to judge height is independent of the attacker's height being more likely to be under 185 cm. If the witness's ability to judge height is influenced by the attacker's actual height, then this calculation could be off. But based on the information given, we have no reason to believe this is the case.

So, {probability: 0.8}. The attacker is estimated to be 185 cm or taller with an 80% probability.
