Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually under 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness will identify him as 185 cm or taller.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, this implies that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- U: The event that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- T: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

We know that P(W|T) = 1 (since if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will always correctly identify him as such), P(T) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), and P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|U) * P(U) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32 (since the overall misidentification rate is 0.2, as stated).

Therefore, P(T|W) = 0.15 / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.46875}
