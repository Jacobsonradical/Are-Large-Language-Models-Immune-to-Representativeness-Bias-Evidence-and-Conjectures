Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

First, let's consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from part a). Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the likelihood of the identification given the attacker's height is 0.8 (80%). The witness also errs 20% of the time, so the false positive rate is 0.2 (20%).

To calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B represents the witness identification.

Plugging in the values:
P(A) = 0.15 (15%)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (80%)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85%)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20%)

After calculating, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
