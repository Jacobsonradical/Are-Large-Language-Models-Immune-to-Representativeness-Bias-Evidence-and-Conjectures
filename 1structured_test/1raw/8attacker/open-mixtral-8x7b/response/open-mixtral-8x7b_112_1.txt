To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we know that the witness correctly identified people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Second, we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the observed evidence
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of the observed evidence, which is the weighted sum of P(B|A) \* P(A) and P(B|not A) \* P(not A), where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2) and P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height was under 185 cm (which is 0.85).

After calculating P(B), we can find P(A|B) and express the answer as a probability between 0 and 1.
