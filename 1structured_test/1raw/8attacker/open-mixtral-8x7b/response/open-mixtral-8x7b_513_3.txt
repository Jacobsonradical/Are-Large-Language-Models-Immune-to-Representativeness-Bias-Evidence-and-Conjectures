To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified people taller than or equal to 185 cm 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%).

P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is:

{probability: 0.41}
