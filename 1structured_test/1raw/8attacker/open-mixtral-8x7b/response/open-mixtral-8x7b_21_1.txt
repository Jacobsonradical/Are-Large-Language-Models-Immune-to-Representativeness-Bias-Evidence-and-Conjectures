To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A =Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B =Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem:
P(A) = P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = P(Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since the witness is always correct when the actual height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = P(Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the actual height is less than 185 cm)
P(not A) = P(Attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [ P(B|A) * P(A) ] / [ P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) ]
P(A|B) = [ 1 * 0.15 ] / [ 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ]
P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.32
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.46875.
