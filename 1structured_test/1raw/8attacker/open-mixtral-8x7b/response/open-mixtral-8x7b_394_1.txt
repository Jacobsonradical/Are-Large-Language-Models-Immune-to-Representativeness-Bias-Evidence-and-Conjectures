To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E): probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From part (a), we have P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B'|A) = 0.2, where B' is the complement of B (witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).

From part (b), we have P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the given values:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (P(B|A') * 0.85)

However, we don't have direct information about P(B|A'), so we need to make an assumption or use additional data to estimate it. Let's assume that the witness makes errors uniformly (i.e., the error rate is the same for both overestimating and underestimating). In that case, P(B'|A') = 0.8 and P(B|A') = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Finally, we can estimate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.351

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.351}
