Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. We also know that the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (when they are not) is 20%.

Now, let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness will correctly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
2. The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Since the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given that P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2, and that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, we can estimate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= [P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) - P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)] / [2 * (P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) - P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm))]

Plugging in the values:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= [0.8 - 0.2] / [2 * (0.8 - 0.2)]
= 0.6 / 1.2
= 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5.
