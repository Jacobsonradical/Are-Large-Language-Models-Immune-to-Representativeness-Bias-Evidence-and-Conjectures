To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time.

P(Correctly identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time.

P(Incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the distribution of attackers' heights) and P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as follows:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.32]
â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.375}.
