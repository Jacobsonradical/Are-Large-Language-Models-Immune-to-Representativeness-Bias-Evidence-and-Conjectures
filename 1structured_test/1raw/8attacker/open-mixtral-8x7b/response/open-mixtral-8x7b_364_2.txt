The problem can be broken down as follows:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. This means that the prior probability of a person randomly selected from the population being taller or shorter than 185 cm is 0.5.
2. We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the likelihood of the attacker's height given the two categories.
3. We are also given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and erred 20% of the time. This is the conditional probability of the witness's identification given the attacker's actual height.

Based on this information, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and I be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|I) = P(I|A) \* P(A) / P(I)

We are given that P(I|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.5, and we need to find P(I) and P(I|not A).

P(I) = P(I|A) \* P(A) + P(I|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + P(I|not A) \* 0.5

We are also given that P(not A) = 0.5, and that P(I|not A) = 1 - P(not I|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (because the witness erred 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller).

Therefore, P(I) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.8

Now we can compute the posterior probability P(A|I) = P(I|A) \* P(A) / P(I) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.8 = 0.5

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's identification is independent of the attacker's height, which is not the case given that the witness has a higher error rate when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. To account for this dependency, we can use the law of total probability:

P(A|I) = P(I|A, not A) \* P(A|not A) + P(I|A) \* P(A)

We are given that P(I|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.5, P(A|not A) = 0.2 (because the witness erroneously identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller), and we need to find P(I|A, not A).

Since the witness is equally likely to make an error when identifying a short attacker as when identifying a tall attacker, we have P(I|A, not A) = 0.5 \* 0.2 + 0.5 \* 0.8 = 0.5

Therefore, the posterior probability P(A|I) = 0.5 \* 0.2 + 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.6

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6}
