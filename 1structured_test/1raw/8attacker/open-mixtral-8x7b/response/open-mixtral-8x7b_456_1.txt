Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%.

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(185 cm | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(witness identification)

We are given P(witness identification | 185 cm) = 0.8
Since the population is roughly equally split, P(185 cm) = 0.5

To find P(witness identification), we need to calculate the probability of the witness identification for both height categories:
P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(witness identification | < 185 cm) * P(< 185 cm)

We are given P(witness identification | 185 cm) = 0.8 and P(witness identification | < 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% error rate)

So, P(witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification:
P(185 cm | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

{probability: 0.667}
