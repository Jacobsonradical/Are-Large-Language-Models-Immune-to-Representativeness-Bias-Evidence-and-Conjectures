To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b". We will apply conditional probability and Bayes' theorem to calculate the final probability.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we have the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

From statement "b", we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller in 85% of such cases)

Now, we can calculate P(¬B), the probability of the witness not identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(¬B) = P(¬B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(¬B) = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.15 * 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.1275 = 0.1575

Now, we can calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = 1 - P(¬B) = 1 - 0.1575 = 0.8425

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8425
P(A|B) ≈ 0.1429 / 0.8425
P(A|B) ≈ 0.1692

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1692 (or 16.92%).

answer: {probability: 0.1692}
