Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values in:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4137931 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
