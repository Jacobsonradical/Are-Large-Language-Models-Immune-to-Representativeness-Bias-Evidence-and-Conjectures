Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equally divided between people under and at or above 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.5

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.889 (88.9%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 88.9%.
