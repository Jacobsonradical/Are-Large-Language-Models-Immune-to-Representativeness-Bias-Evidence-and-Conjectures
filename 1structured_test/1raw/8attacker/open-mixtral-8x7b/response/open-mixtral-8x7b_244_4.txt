Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This gives us the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller as 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller as 0.2.

b) In the population, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information. We can use Bayes' theorem to do this.

Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being under 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17)
= 0.09 / 0.26
= 0.346154

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
