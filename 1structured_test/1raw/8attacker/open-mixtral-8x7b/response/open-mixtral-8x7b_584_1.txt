To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in "a" and "b" to calculate the probabilities independently, and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We'll call this probability P(W|H), where W is the event of the witness identifying the attacker correctly, and H is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information given in "a", P(W|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. We'll call this probability P(W|~H), where ~H is the event of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. According to the information given in "a", P(W|~H) = 0.2, since the witness has a 20% chance of erroneously identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution given in "b". We'll call this probability P(H). Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15.

Similarly, let's calculate the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution given in "b". We'll call this probability P(~H). Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(~H) = 0.85.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. We'll call this probability P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / (P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)).

Substituting the values we calculated above, we get P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.108 / (0.108 + 0.17) = 0.3867 (rounded to four decimal places).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3867}
