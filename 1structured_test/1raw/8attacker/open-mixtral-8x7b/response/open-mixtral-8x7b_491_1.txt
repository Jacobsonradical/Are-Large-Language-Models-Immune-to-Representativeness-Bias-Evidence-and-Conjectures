Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This gives us a conditional probability P(witness says 185cm+ | attacker is 185cm+) = 0.8 and P(witness says 185cm+ | attacker is not 185cm+) = 0.2.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability P(attacker is 185cm+) = 0.15.
