Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being actually shorter than 185 cm despite the witness identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

b) 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This implies that the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 1
