Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the population's distribution.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate.

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

1. First, consider the likelihood of the witness being correct. The witness is correct 80% of the time. Thus, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

2. Second, consider the possibility of the witness being incorrect. The witness errs 20% of the time. However, we don't have enough information to determine the distribution of these errors (whether they are more likely to claim someone is taller when they are not or vice versa).

3. Based on the information available, we can only use the witness's accuracy rate to estimate the probability. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
