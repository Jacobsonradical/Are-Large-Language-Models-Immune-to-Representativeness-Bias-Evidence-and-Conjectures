To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: Given the attacker's height, the probability that the court assessed the witness's ability and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller, the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(not A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

We also need P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate it as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
