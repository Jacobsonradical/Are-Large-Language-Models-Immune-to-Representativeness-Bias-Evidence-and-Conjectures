Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right and a 20% chance they're wrong.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

Since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, without any additional information, we would assume the probability of any given attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%.

However, since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and we trust the witness's ability to judge a person's height 80% of the time, we should adjust our estimate based on the witness's statement.

We can model this as a probability tree:

- The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:
  (Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller AND the witness being correct) / (Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

- This simplifies to:
  (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)

- Calculating this value, we find that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.28 or 28%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 28%.
