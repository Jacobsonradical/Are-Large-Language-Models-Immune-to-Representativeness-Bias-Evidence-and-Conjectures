To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the provided information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies people taller than or equal to 185 cm 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can represent this as follows:

P(Correctly Identified | Height >= 185 cm) = 0.8
P(Incorrectly Identified | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are people 185 cm or taller. We can represent this as follows:

P(Height < 185 cm | Attacker) = 0.85
P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker) = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker, Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Height >= 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker) / P(Witness Identification | Attacker)

We can calculate P(Witness Identification | Attacker) as follows:

P(Witness Identification | Attacker) = P(Witness Identification and Height >= 185 cm | Attacker) + P(Witness Identification and Height < 185 cm | Attacker)

We are given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, so:

P(Witness Identification and Height >= 185 cm | Attacker) = 1

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(Witness Identification and Height < 185 cm | Attacker) as follows:

P(Witness Identification and Height < 185 cm | Attacker) = P(Witness Identification | Height < 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height < 185 cm | Attacker)

We can calculate P(Witness Identification | Height < 185 cm, Attacker) using the witness's error rate:

P(Witness Identification | Height < 185 cm, Attacker) = P(Incorrectly Identified | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Witness Identification | Attacker) = 1 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 1.16

Since this value is greater than 1, it suggests that the witness's identification is not reliable given the prior distribution of attackers' heights. However, we can still use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker, Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Height >= 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker) / P(Witness Identification | Attacker)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Height >= 185 cm | Attacker, Witness Identification) = 1 * 0.15 / 1.16 = 0.129

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.129}
