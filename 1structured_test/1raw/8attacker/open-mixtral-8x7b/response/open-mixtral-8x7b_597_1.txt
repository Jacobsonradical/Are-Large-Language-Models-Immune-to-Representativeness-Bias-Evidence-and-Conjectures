To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm.
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (0.8, or 80%).
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (0.2, or 20%).
- P(B|W) as the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find: P(A|W)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)]

We know:
P(W|A) = 0.8
P(W|B) = 0.2
P(B) = 0.55 (85% of 0.65, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.45 (1 - 0.55)

Now, we need to calculate P(B|W):

P(B|W) = P(W|B) * P(B) / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|A) * P(A)]
P(B|W) = (0.2 * 0.55) / [(0.2 * 0.55) + (0.8 * 0.45)]
P(B|W) ≈ 0.2222

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B|W) * P(B) / P(B|W)]
P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.45] / [0.8 * 0.45 + 0.2 * 0.2222 * 0.55]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.6556

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6556}
