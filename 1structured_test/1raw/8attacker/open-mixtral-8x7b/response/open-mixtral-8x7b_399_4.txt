To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We are also given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:

* P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness reports the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller
* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
* P(B) is the probability that the witness reports the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We are given:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B):

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
* P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness reports the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is NOT actually 185 cm or taller
* P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was NOT 185 cm or taller
* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)
* P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is the complement of the true positive rate, so P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2

So, we can calculate P(B):

* P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

* P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
