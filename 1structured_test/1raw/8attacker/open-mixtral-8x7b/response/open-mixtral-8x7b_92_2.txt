To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are mistaken. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and 85% are not, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 because the witness would be mistaken 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller. We also know that P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4535}
