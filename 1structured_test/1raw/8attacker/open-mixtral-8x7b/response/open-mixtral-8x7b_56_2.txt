Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions as accurate 80% of the time.

Given this information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are above this height)

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probabilities of the two possible scenarios: the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Scenario 1: The witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

Scenario 2: The witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Now, we can find P(B) by adding the probabilities of these two scenarios:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
