Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct identification) = 0.8
P(Incorrect identification) = 0.2

From statement a, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Identified as 185 cm or taller)

The term P(Identified as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:
P(Identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Under 185 cm) * P(Under 185 cm)

We have all the required values to calculate the probability:

P(185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

After calculating the above expression, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) â‰ˆ 0.4286 or 42.86%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is approximately 42.86%.
