To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define some terms:
- Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.
- Let E be the event that the witness errs in identifying the attacker's height.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Mathematically, this means that:

P(W | H) = 0.8
P(E | H) = 0.2

From statement (b), we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Mathematically, this means that:

P(H) = 0.15

To find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H | W) = (P(W | H) \* P(H)) / (P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | not H) \* P(not H))

We don't have direct information about P(W | not H), but we can use the law of total probability to find it:

P(W) = P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | not H) \* P(not H)

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time, so:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + P(W | not H) \* 0.85

Solving for P(W | not H):

P(W | not H) = (P(W) - 0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.85

Now we can find P(H | W):

P(H | W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Simplifying:

P(H | W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
