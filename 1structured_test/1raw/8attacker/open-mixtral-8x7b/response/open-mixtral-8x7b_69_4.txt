To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in two parts:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From part a), we have P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(¬W|A) = 0.2, where ¬W is the event that the witness does not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From part b), we have P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(¬W|A) * P(¬A)]

Now we compute the value:
P(A|W) = (0.8) * (0.15) / [(0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)] ≈ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
