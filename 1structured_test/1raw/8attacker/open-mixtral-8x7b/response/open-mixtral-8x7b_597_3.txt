To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote:
- P(A): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(~B): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(C): the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(~C): the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 1
