Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the assessment is correct and a 20% chance that it's an error.

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, but the population is roughly equally split between those two height categories. This means that even though attackers are more likely to be shorter, taller people make up half the population.

Given these facts, the probability that a person chosen at random from the attacker population who fits the description given by the witness (185 cm or taller) is 15% (the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 80% (the accuracy of the witness's assessment) + 50% (the proportion of people in the population who are 185 cm or taller) * 20% (the error rate of the witness's assessment), which equals 0.15*0.8 + 0.5*0.2 = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22 or 22%.

{probability: 0.22}
