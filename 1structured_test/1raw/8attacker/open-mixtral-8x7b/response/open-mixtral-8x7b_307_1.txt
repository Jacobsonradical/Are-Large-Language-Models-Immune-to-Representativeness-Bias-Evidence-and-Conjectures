To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event A) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event B).

P(A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Next, we can use the distribution of attackers' heights to calculate the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(A | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified 185 cm or taller)

P(witness identified 185 cm or taller) = P(A) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(B) \* P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

P(witness identified 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Substituting the values back into Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.293

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.293}
