Based on the information provided, let's first estimate the overall population distribution and then calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. This implies a 50-50 distribution.

2. We are told that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% attackers are 1
