To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's define our probabilities:
- P(A'): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(A): The attacker is under 185 cm
- P(W|A'): The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W'|A): The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as under 185 cm
- P(W|A'): The witness correctly identifies the attacker as under 185 cm
- P(W'|A): The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in P(A'|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A'|W) = P(W|A') * P(A') / [P(W|A') * P(A') + P(W|A) * P(A)]

Given the information, we can assign the following probabilities:
- P(W|A') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller attacker)
- P(A') = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A'|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A'|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36 or 36%.
