To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This implies that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance the witness would have correctly identified the height and a 20% chance the witness would have incorrectly identified a shorter attacker.

2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to calculate P(A) which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(B) which is the probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

From statement "a", we know that the witness erred 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identified a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller). Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.3571

Answer: {probability: 0.3571}
