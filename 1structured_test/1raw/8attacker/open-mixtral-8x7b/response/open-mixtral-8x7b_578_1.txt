Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use the witness's statistics to calculate a likelihood ratio, comparing the probability of the witness identifying a tall attacker to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall.

P(witness identifies tall person | attacker is tall) = 0.8
P(witness identifies short person as tall | attacker is short) = 0.2

Now, we need to calculate the prior probabilities based on the given information:
- Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(attacker is tall) = 0.15
- Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(attacker is short) = 0.85

Applying Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is tall | witness identifies tall person) = [P(witness identifies tall person | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall)] / P(witness identifies tall person)

The denominator P(witness identifies tall person) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a tall attacker and a short attacker as tall:

P(witness identifies tall person) = [P(witness identifies tall person | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall)] + [P(witness identifies short person as tall | attacker is short) * P(attacker is short)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(attacker is tall | witness identifies tall person) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
