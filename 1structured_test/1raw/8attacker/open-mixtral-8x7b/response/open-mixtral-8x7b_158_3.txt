Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This means that even though there are many people in the general population who are this tall, they are less likely to be attackers.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs in 20% of the cases.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We need to account for both the base rate of such attackers in the population and the accuracy of the witness.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%)
P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80%)

We need to find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), which we can calculate as follows:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%). Since the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter and taller than 185 cm, we have:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 41%.
