Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people in this scenario.

2. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

(0.5 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.80) = 0.075 + 0.4 = 0.475

This calculation takes into account the base rate of taller attackers (15%) and the accuracy of the witness's identification (80%).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.475}
