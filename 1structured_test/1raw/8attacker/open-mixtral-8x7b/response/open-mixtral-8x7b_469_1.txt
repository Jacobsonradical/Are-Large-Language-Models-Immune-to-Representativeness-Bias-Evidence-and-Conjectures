Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the witness will identify them correctly, and if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B be the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information provided:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

{probability: 0.36}
