To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time) and P(B'|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs and identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

From statement "b", we know that P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually under 185 cm, which we can denote as P(B|A'). From statement "a", we know that the witness errs in 20% of cases, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

We can then use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(A|B) = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.
