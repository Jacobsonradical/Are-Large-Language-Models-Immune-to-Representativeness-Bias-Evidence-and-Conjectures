To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the witness's accuracy when the person is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as P(B|A), and the overall probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller as P(B).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. To find P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies them as such with probability 0.8; and the attacker is actually under 185 cm, and the witness erroneously identifies them as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2.

The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is therefore:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931034482759

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
