Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that, although the population is evenly split, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, meaning they correctly identified tall attackers 80% of the time and incorrectly identified short attackers as tall 20% of the time.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness says 185 cm) = [P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm)] / P(Witness says 185 cm)

We know:
P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(Attacker is 185 cm) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(Witness says 185 cm):

P(Witness says 185 cm) = P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) + P(Witness says 185 cm | Attacker is not 185 cm) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm)
P(Witness says 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness says 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.345 (or 34.5%).
