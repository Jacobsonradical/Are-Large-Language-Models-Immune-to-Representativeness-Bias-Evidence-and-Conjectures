To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (event A) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (event B).

Event A: P(A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller)

Event B: P(B) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each event given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (event C) and given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (event D):

P(A|C) = Probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8

P(B|D) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So:

P(C) = Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15

P(D) = Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(C|A) = P(A|C) * P(C) / (P(A|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D))

P(C|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

P(C|A) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
