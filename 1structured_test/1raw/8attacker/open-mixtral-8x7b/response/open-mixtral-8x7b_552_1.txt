To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (event A) and the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (event ~A). We are given that the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

P(A) = 0.8
P(~A) = 0.2

Next, we need to find the probability of a person actually being 185 cm or taller among attackers. We are given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (event B) and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm (event ~B).

P(B) = 0.15
P(~B) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

We know that P(A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. To find P(A and B), we can multiply the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (P(A)) with the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller (P(B)).

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
P(A and B) = 0.8 * 0.15
P(A and B) = 0.12

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.8
P(B|A) â‰ˆ 0.15

However, since the witness's identification is not enough to conclude the attacker's height, we need to consider the prior probability as well:

P(B) = 0.15

Since the prior probability and the posterior probability are equal in this case, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller remains:

{probability: 0.15}
