To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This gives us some idea of the witness's reliability.

From statement "b", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, but 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This gives us information about the distribution of attackers' heights.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.5, given that the population is roughly equal).
- P(B) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15, as given in statement "b").
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from statement "a").
- P(W|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (from statement "a").

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) \* P(A)) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))

Calculate the result:

P(A|W) ≈ 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
