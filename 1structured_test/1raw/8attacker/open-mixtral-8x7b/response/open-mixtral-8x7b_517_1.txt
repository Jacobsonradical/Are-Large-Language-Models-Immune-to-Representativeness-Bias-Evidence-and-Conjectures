Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the assessment is correct and a 20% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, and assuming the witness's error rate is random and doesn't favor one group over the other, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The probability would be the witness's correct identification rate, which is 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
