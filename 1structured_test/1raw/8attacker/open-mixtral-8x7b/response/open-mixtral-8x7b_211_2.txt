Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that being 185 cm or taller might be somewhat atypical for this particular group of people (attackers).

Next, we have a witness who correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to account for both the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15%) and the accuracy of the witness (80%).

One way to combine these pieces of information is to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
W = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We know the following probabilities from the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider all possible ways the witness can identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This includes both the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the cases where the witness errs and identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know P(W|A) and P(A). To calculate P(W|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not, we use the complementary probability: P(W|¬A) = 1 - P(W|A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.

We also know that P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
      = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
      ≈ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
