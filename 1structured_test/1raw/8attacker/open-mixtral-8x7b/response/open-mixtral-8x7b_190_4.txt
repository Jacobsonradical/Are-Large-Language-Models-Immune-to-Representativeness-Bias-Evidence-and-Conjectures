Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attacks are more likely to be committed by people under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This could suggest that there are more people under 185 cm in the relevant population (people capable of committing such attacks).

Now, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let's denote this probability as P(Taller). 

We know that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will correctly identify this. And if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter), there's a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify them as such.

However, we also know from the first piece of information that attackers are more likely to be shorter. So, even if the witnessed identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, it could be more likely that they are mistaken.

To estimate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of various events.

P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = [P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness Identified Taller)

We are given P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) = 0.8 and P(Taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

We need to find P(Witness Identified Taller), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for two scenarios: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness erroneously identifies them as such.

P(Witness Identified Taller) = P(Witness Identified Taller and Taller) + P(Witness Identified Taller and Not Taller)
= P(Witness Identified Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness Identified Taller | Not Taller) * P(Not Taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness Identified Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.345

So, given the information provided, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
