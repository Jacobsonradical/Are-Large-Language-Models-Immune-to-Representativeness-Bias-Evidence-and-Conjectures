Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is 80% or 0.8. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they were not. The witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

The total population is evenly split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, whether correct or not, is 50% or 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the identified attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, by using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (given the evenly split population)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, whether correct or not, which is 0.5

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
