Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate in judging height and a 20% error rate.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability of correct identification)
- P(A) = 15% (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), which is the total probability of a witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(B|A), P(A), and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller). To find P(B|not A), we use the witness's error rate of 20%.

P(B|not A) = error rate * (1 - P(A)) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.17 * 0.85] = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2645
â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
