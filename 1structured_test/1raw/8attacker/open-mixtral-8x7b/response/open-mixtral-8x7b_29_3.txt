Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This implies that attackers are more likely to be below 185 cm than the general population.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as at/above 185 cm 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm based on the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is at/above 185 cm.
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as at/above 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (given in the problem, the population is roughly 50-50)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is at/above 185 cm)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not at/above 185 cm)

We want P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
