Let's analyze the information given:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This indicates that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.
b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on this information.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A) is the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the initial information.
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as the sum of the product of the probability of the attacker's height and the probability of the witness identifying them correctly or incorrectly:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)
= 0.096 / 0.266
= 0.361344537815126

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.361 (36.1%).
