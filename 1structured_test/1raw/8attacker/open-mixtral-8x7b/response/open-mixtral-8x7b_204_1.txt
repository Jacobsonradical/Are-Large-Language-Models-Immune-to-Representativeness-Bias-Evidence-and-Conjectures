Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions as 80% accurate and a 20% error rate.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From part b, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with an 80% rate (P(B|A) = 0.8) and is wrong 20% of the time (P(B'|A) = 0.2).

What we want to find is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, which is P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

However, we don't have information about P(A), the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Without this information, we cannot accurately compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
