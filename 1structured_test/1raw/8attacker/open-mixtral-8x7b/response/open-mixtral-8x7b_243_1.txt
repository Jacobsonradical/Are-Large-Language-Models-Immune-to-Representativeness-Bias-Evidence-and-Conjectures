To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness identified the attacker as being taller or shorter than 185 cm.

To account for both possibilities, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, and the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

We also know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

However, we do not know P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability and consider the two possible events: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A), but we don't know P(B|not A) and P(not A).

However, we can use the witness's error rate to estimate P(B|not A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate that P(B|not A) is the product of these two probabilities:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

We can also estimate P(not A) as 1 - P(A), which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2645
= 0.12 / 0.2645
= 0.4535

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4535 or 45.35%.
