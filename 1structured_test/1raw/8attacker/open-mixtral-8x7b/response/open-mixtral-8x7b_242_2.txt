Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this witness under similar conditions.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's statistics to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so there's an 80% chance that an identified person is actually 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}
