Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. Let's denote this probability as P(W|T), where W is the event of the witness identification and T is the event of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

So, P(W|T) = 0.8

However, we need to find the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(T). To do this, we can use the additional information provided about the distribution of attackers' heights in the population. It is mentioned that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller. Also, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Knowing that P(T) + P(T') = 1, where T' represents the event of the attacker's height being under 185 cm, we can find P(T').

P(T') = 1 - P(T) = 0.5 (since the population is equally split)

Now, given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can find P(T') as:

P(T') = 0.85

Therefore, P(T) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, to find the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to calculate P(T|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

We know P(W|T) and P(T), but we don't know P(W). However, since we are only interested in the probability ratio P(T|W) / P(T'), we can simplify Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(T|W) / P(T') = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W|T') * P(T')

We know P(W|T) and P(T), and we have calculated P(T') above. To find P(W|T'), we use the fact that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time. So, P(W|T') = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate the probability ratio:

P(T|W) / P(T') = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.9 / 0.17 = 5.294

Since the probability ratio is significantly greater than 1, we can be more confident that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, to provide an estimate of the probability in the requested format, we need to normalize the probability ratio so that it sums to 1 for both P(T|W) and P(T'):

P(T|W) = Probability estimate
P(T') = 1 - P(T|W)

Normalizing the probability ratio:

P(T|W) = 5.294 / (5.294 + 1) = 0.842 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:

{probability: 0.842}
