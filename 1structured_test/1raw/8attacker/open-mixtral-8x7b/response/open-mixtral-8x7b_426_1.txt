Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The error rate for this identification is 20% or 0.2. Since the error rates are equal for both overestimation and underestimation of height, we can calculate the probability that a person who is actually 185 cm or taller is identified correctly as follows:

P(Correct identification) = P(Identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(Correct) + P(Identified as shorter than 185 cm) * P(Error)
= 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now, we are given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can approximate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 0.5 or 50%.

Taking into account the witness identification probability of 0.5, we can now calculate the final probability estimate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.5 * 0.5
= 0.25

The answer is:
{probability: 0.25}
