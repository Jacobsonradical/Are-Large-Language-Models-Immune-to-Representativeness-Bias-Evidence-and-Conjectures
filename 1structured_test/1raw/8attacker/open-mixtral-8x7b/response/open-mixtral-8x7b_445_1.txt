Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)] / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

The prior probability P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) is 0.5, since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.

The probability P(identified as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:
P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) * P(actual height is shorter than 185 cm)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] + [0.2 * 0.5]
= 0.5 + 0.1
= 0.6

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.8 * 0.5] / 0.6 = 0.6667, or approximately 67%.

Answer: {probability: 0.67, this is an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller}.
