Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height is 80% accurate when the person is in that height range.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let's assume that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate the probability of this event happening.

Since 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies people in this height range 80% of the time, the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of this height is 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This could happen 20% of the time when the attacker is actually below this height (given that the witness incorrectly identifies people in this height range 20% of the time).

Given that 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being in this range is 0.85. Thus, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as being 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Now, to find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can add the probabilities of the two scenarios we considered:

0.4 (witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) + 0.17 (witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.57

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is: {probability: 0.57}
