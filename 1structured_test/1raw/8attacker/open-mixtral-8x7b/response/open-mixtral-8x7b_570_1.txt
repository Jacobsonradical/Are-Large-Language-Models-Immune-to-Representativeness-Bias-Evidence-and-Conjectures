To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(A' ): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we have:
P(A) + P(A') = 1
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller)
P(B' |A') = 0.8 (probability of identifying the attacker incorrectly as shorter than 185 cm)
P(A') = 0.5 (based on the population distribution)
P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 0.5

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A'))

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.5
P(B'|A') = 0.8
P(A') = 0.5

Now, we need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (probability of identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller)

So,
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.6 = 0.6667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6667}
