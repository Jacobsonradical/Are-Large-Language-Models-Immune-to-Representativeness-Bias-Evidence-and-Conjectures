Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (because the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size and 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

However, we need to adjust this prior probability based on the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is:

P(person is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) * P(person is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

The term P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | person is 185 cm or taller) * P(person is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | person is shorter than 185 cm) * P(person is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(person is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8)) = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.16) = 0.36 / 0.52 â‰ˆ 0.6923

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6923}
