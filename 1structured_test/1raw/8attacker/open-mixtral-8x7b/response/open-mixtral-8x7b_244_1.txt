To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the new evidence from the witness.

We want to find P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witness.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(D|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(D|~H) = 0.2 (the complement of P(D|H), the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
4. P(~H) = 0.5 (from point 1, the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm)
5. P(~D|~H) = 0.85 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D) = [P(D|H) * P(H)] / [P(D|H) * P(H) + P(D|~H) * P(~H)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5 * 0.85)]
= 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.08)
= 0.6
