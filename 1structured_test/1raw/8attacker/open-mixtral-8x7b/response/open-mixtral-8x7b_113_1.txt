To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical variables. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information available. Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the observed information.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, let's determine the prior probabilities P(A) and P(not A). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Next, we need to find the likelihoods P(B|A) and P(B|not A). According to statement (a), the witness correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.80.

To find P(B|not A), we need to consider that the witness errs 20% of the time when judging people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1445)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4545

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4545 or 45.45%.
