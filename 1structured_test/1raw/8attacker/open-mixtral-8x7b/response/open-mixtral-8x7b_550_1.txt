To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can denote these probabilities as P(T|W) = 0.8 and P(F|W) = 0.2, where T is the event that the person is 185 cm or taller, F is the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm, and W is the event that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "b", we know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can denote this probability as P(W|T) = 0.15, which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, P(T). We can use Bayes' theorem to find this:

P(T) = P(W and T) / P(W)
= P(W|T) \* P(T) / (P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F))

We know that P(W|T) = 0.15, and since P(T) + P(F) = 1, we can express P(F) as 1 - P(T).

The witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, so P(W|F) = 1 - P(W|T) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

We also know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so we can assume that P(T) = P(F) = 0.5.

Now we can calculate P(T):

P(T) = 0.15 \* 0.5 / (0.15 \* 0.5 + 0.85 \* 0.5)
= 0.075 / (0.075 + 0.425)
= 0.075 / 0.5
= 0.15

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.
