To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. In the population, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases:

- the attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
