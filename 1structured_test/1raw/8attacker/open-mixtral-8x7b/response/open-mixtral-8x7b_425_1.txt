To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they were, and erred 20% of the time when they were not. This gives us the following probability:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This gives us the following probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(witness says 185 cm or taller):

P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values we have:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
