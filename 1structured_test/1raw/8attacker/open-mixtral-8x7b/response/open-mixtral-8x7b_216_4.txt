Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct identification) = 0.8
P(incorrect identification) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can use these probabilities for both cases.

P(attacker is taller, identified as taller) = P(attacker is taller) * P(correct identification)
P(attacker is taller, identified as shorter) = P(attacker is taller) * P(incorrect identification)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is taller | identified as taller) = [P(identified as taller | attacker is taller) * P(attacker is taller)] / P(identified as taller)

The term P(identified as taller) can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of being identified as taller for both cases (attacker is taller and attacker is not taller):

P(identified as taller) = P(identified as taller | attacker is taller) * P(attacker is taller) + P(identified as taller | attacker is not taller) * P(attacker is not taller)

Since the population is roughly equal in size, we can approximate P(attacker is taller) = P(attacker is not taller) = 0.5.

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(identified as taller | attacker is taller) = 0.8
P(identified as taller | attacker is not taller) = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller)

Substituting these values into the equation:

P(identified as taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(attacker is taller | identified as taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.667}
