Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of them are by people under 185 cm. This means that even though the population is evenly split, taller people are less likely to be attackers.

Now let's consider the witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We have two possibilities: the witness is correct, or the witness is incorrect. The probability of the witness being correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.2 (20%).

However, we also know that taller people are less likely to be attackers (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). Therefore, even if the witness is correct, it's less likely that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we need to multiply the witness's reliability (0.8) by the base rate of tall attackers (0.15). This gives us:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
