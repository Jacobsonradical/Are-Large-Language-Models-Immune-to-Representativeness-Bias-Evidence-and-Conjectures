To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given a positive identification by the witness, is 0.8 (the witness's sensitivity).
2. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, without any other information, is 0.15 (from part b of the statement, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

Given these two probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We can simplify the calculation using the witness's sensitivity and the prior probability:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85)
P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 (or 12%).
