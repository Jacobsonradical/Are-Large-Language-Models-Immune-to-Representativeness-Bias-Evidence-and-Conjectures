Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when the population is split equally between those under and at/above 185 cm.

Given these facts, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller. Therefore, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.
