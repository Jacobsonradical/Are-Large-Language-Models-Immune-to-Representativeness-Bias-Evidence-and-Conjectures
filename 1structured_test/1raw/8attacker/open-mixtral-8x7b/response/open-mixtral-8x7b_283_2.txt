Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such judgments.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to estimate P(A).

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.

P(Correct|A) = 0.8 and P(Incorrect|not A) = 0.8 (complementary probability)

P(not A) = 1 - P(A)

Now, we want to calculate P(A|Correct), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|Correct) = P(Correct|A) * P(A) / P(Correct)

To calculate P(Correct), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. P(Correct and A) = P(Correct|A) * P(A)
2. P(Correct and not A) = P(Correct|not A) * P(not A)

P(Correct) = P(Correct and A) + P(Correct and not A)

Substituting the expressions from above:
P(Correct) = (0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A)))

Now we can find P(A|Correct):
P(A|Correct) = (0.8 * P(A)) / ((0.8 * P(A)) + (0.2 * (1 - P(A))))

Since we don't have information on the exact prior probability P(A), we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. However, if we assume that P(A) is close to 0.5 (given that the population is roughly equally split), then the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, P(A|Correct), would be close to 0.8, reflecting the witness's accuracy.

{probability: ~0.8, assumption: P(A) is close to 0.5}
