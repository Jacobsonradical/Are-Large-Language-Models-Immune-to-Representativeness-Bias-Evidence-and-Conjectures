Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This indicates that short people may be more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate for such judgments.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of taller attackers and the witness's accuracy. This is a classic problem of combining evidence from multiple sources, and we can use Bayes' theorem to solve it.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

From the problem, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies taller attackers 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies shorter attackers as taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm)
- P(¬A) = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
