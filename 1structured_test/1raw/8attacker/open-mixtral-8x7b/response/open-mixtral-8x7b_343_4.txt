Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. There is an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm (85% of the time). This suggests that taller individuals may be less likely to be attackers.

However, the witness in this case identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height under such conditions. 

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller. 

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) is 15% (from point a), and that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller (from point b).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A) and P(B|A), but we need to find P(B).

P(B) can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8, P(A) = 15%, and P(not A) = 85%.

To find P(B|not A), we can use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying a person's height:
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.3448275862068966

Given the witness's identification, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be approximately 34.48%.
