Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps.

The total population has roughly equal numbers of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability:

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to statement (a), 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the total population is divided equally between the two height categories, this means that people who are 185 cm or taller make up 15/(85+15) = 0.15 or 15% of the attackers.

So, P(A) = 0.15.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
