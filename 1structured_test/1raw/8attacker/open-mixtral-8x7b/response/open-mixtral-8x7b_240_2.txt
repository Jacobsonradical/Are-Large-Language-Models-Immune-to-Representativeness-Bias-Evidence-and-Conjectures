Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This indicates that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We seek P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the problem, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (assuming 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (assuming 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
