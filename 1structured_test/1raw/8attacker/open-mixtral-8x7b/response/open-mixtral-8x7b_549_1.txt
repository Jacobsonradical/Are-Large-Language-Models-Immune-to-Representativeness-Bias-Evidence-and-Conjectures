To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate a conditional probability.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can use this information to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then, we are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement "b", we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (attackers who are 185 cm or taller and are correctly identified as such) and the false positives (attackers who are shorter than 185 cm but are incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller).

Let C be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, the probability of a false positive is P(B|C) = 0.2 (from statement "a"). The probability of a true positive is P(B|A) = 0.8 (also from statement "a").

Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm (from statement "b"), we have:

P(C) = 0.85
P(A) = 1 - P(C) = 0.15

We can now calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and C)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|C) \* P(C)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
