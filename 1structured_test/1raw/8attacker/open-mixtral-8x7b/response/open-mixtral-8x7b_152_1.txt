To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population. We will use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the observed evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

1. P(B|A): The probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
2. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Since the population has roughly an equal number of people shorter and taller than 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, this probability is 0.15.
3. P(B|not A): The probability of observing the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
4. P(not A): The prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm. Since the population has roughly an equal number of people shorter and taller than 185 cm, this probability is 0.85.

Now, let's compute the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
