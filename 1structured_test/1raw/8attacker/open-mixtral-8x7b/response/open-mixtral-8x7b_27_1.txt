Let's analyze the information given:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that there are more attackers who are shorter than the average height.
b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. We will use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We know:
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 15% (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 85% (prior probability of an attacker being under 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (or 41.38% when expressed as a percentage)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
