Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

From this, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)] / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under and at or above 185 cm, so:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5

We also know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller)]
P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.667, or 66.7%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 66.7%.
