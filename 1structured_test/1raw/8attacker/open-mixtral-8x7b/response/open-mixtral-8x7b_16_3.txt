To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability that the witness does not identify a person as 185 cm or taller

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we have:
- P(B | A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B' | A) = 0.2

Given the distribution of attackers' heights, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We also know that:
- P(B | A') = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B' | A') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as under 185 cm 80% of the time)

We can now calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker's height is under 185 cm:
- P(B | A') = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A | B):

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / (P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After computing, we get:
