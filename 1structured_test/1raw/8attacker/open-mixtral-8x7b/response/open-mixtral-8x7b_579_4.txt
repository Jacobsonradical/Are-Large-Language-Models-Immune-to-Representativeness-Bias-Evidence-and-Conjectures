To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the probabilities and then apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person, denoted as P(W|T). This is given as 0.8 in statement (a). Similarly, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|F). This is given as 0.2 in statement (a).

Next, we can calculate the prior probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(T), and the attacker being under 185 cm, denoted as P(F), using the information from statement (b). We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller in the population of attackers. Therefore, P(T) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, denoted as P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values we calculated above, we get:

P(T|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.36 or 36%.
