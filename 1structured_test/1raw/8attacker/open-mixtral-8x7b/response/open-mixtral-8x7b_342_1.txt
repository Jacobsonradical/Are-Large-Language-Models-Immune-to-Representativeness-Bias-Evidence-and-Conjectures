To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm (statement b), we can assume that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability of incorrectly identifying an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller).

From statement (b), we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now we need to calculate P(B). To do this, we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
