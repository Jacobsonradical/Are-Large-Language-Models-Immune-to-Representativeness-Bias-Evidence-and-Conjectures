Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is given as 80% or 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to multiply these two probabilities together to get the overall probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the attacker actually being this tall.

Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.8 (for correct identification) * 0.15 (for being an attacker of this height) = 0.12, or 12%.
