Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm):

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (because the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller)] / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

The term P(actually 185 cm or taller) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability is 0.15.

We can further break down the term P(identified as 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) * P(actually shorter than 185 cm)

Since the population is roughly equal, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.5 (i.e., P(actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.5455 (rounded to 5 decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5455}
