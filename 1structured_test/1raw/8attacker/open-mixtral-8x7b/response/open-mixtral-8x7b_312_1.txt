To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the total number of correct and incorrect judgments by the witness. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, half of the sample will be shorter and half will be taller. Thus, the witness will correctly identify the height of 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 or 40% of the people in the sample. The witness will err in 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the cases, identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (0.1) by the proportion of attackers who are actually 185 cm or taller (0.15). Thus, the estimated probability is 0.1 * 0.15 = 0.015 or 1.5%.

Answer: {probability: 0.015}
