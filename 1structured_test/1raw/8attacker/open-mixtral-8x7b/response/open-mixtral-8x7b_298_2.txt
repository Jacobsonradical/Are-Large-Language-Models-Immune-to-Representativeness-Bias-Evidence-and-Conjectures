To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that this assessment is correct.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, even if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is only a 15% chance that this identification is correct.

To estimate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the witness's accuracy (0.8) by the distribution of attackers' heights (0.15). This gives us:

probability = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
