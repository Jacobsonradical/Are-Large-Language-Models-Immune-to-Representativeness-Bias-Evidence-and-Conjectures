To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability is:

P(Tall | Witness identifies Tall) = 0.8

Next, we need to account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) = 1 - P(Witness identifies Short | Tall) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall) = P(Tall) * P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) / P(Witness identifies Tall)

We know P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) = 0.80, and we can calculate P(Witness identifies Tall) using the law of total probability:

P(Witness identifies Tall) = P(Tall) * P(Witness identifies Tall | Tall) + P(Short) * P(Witness identifies Tall | Short)

Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we have:

P(Tall) = 0.5 and P(Short) = 0.5

We also know that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(Witness identifies Tall | Short) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(Witness identifies Tall):

P(Witness identifies Tall) = 0.5 * 0.80 + 0.5 * 0.20 = 0.50 + 0.10 = 0.60

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall) = 0.5 * 0.80 / 0.60 = 0.40 / 0.60 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
