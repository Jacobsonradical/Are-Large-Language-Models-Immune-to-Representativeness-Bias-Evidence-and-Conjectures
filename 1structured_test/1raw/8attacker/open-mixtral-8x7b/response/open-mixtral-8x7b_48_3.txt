Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. Let's denote this probability P(W|T), where W is the event of witness identification and T is the event of the person being 185 cm or taller.

Next, we need to calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not that tall, denoted as P(W|NT). This is given as the error rate of the witness, which is 20%.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the information provided. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|NT) * P(NT)]

However, the prior probabilities P(T) and P(NT) are not explicitly given. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume a 50-50 split for simplicity.

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
