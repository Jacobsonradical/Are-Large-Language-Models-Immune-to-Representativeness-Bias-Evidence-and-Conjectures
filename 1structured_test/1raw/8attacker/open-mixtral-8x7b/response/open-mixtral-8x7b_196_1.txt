To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From part a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, we can say that:

P(A|W) = 0.8 (the probability of A given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A|W) = 0.2 (the probability of not A given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

From part b, we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, we can say that:

P(W|A) = 0.15 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.85 (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A):

P(A) = [P(W|A) * P(A|W)] / [P(W|A) * P(A|W) + P(W|not A) * P(not A|W)]
P(A) = [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]
P(A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A) = 0.4138 (approximately)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4138}.
