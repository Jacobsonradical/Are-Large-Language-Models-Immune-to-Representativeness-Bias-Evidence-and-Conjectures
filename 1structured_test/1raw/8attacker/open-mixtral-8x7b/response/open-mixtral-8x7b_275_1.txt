Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height. Therefore:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.50
P(Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.50

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct ID) = 0.80

And the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually under 185 cm:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is under 185 cm) = P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We just need to find P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is under 185 cm) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm)
P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50) = 0.60

Now we can calculate the final probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60 = 0.6667 â‰ˆ 0.67

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.67.
