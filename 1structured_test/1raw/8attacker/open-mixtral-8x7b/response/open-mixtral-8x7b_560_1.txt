Given the two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the witness's assessment has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 80% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 20%.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. This implies that the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the base rate of attackers being under 185 cm is 0.85.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the post-test odds of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's assessment:

post-test odds = (PPV * base rate) / (FPR * (1 - base rate))

plugging in the values:

post-test odds = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.2 * (1 - 0.15))

post-test odds = 0.096 / 0.168

post-test odds = 0.5714

To convert post-test odds to probability, we divide the post-test odds by 1 plus the post-test odds:

probability = post-test odds / (1 + post-test odds)

probability = 0.5714 / (1 + 0.5714)

probability = 0.362

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.362 or 36.2%.
