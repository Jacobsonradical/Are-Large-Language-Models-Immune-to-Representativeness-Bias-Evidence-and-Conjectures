To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's first calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm:
P(Incorrect identification | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we use the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observation of the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | Observation) = [P(Observation | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Observation)

Given that the observation is either the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller or incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(Observation) = P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(Incorrect identification | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Observation) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | Observation) = [P(Observation | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Observation)
P(185 cm or taller | Observation) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
