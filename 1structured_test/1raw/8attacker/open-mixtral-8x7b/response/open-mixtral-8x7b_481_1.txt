Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify this 80% of the time. Similarly, if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Since the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, we can estimate the probability as follows:

(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
