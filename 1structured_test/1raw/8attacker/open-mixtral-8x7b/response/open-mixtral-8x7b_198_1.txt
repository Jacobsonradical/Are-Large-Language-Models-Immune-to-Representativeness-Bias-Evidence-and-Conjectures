Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, and the witness incorrectly identifies people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, this means that the witness is likely to incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller even if they are not:

P(Incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller | Actual height is under 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

However, we need to calculate P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) in the denominator. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.4138.
