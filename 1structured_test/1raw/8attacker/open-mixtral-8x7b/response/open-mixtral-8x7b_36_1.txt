To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

We know that the witness correctly identified people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Also, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to account for both the correct identifications and the errors. Let X be the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. Then:

X = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
X = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
X = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
