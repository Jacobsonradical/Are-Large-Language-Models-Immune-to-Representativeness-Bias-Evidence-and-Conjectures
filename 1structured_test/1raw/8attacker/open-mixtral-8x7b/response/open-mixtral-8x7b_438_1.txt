To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the probabilities and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(A'') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B'|A'') as the probability of the witness being correct when identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B'|A') as the probability of the witness being incorrect when identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

From statement a, we have:
P(A'') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B'|A'') = 0.8 (when the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, they are correct 80% of the time)
P(B'|A') = 0.2 (when the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, they are incorrect 20% of the time)

From statement b, we have:
P(B) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A''|B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(A''|B) = P(A'') * P(B'|A'') / (P(A'') * P(B'|A'') + P(A') * P(B'|A'))

We need to find P(A'), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since there are roughly equal numbers of people shorter and taller than 185 cm, and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, then P(A') = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Substituting the values, we have:

P(A''|B) = (0.8 * 0.8) / ((0.8 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2)) ≈ 0.9655

Now, to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use:

P(A) = P(A''|B) * P(B) / P(B'|A'')

We already have P(A''|B) ≈ 0.9655 and P(B) = 0.15. We can find P(B'|A'') as the complement of P(B'|A''), so P(B'|A'') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we have:

P(A) = (0.9655 * 0.15) / 0.2 ≈ 0.7266

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.7266}
