To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both (a) and (b).

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they made an error.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's combine these two pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. We also know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (when the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (when the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller). The probability of a true positive is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability of a false positive is P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, the probability of B (the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is the sum of the true positives and false positives:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
