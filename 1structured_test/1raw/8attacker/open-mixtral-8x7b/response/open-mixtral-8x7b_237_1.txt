To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' ): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(S): probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm
- P(T): probability that a person is 185 cm or taller

From the given information:
a) P(B|T) = 0.8 and P(B' |T) = 0.2
b) P(T) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85

We want to calculate P(T|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|B) = P(B|T) * P(T) / (P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|S) * P(S))

However, we do not have P(B|S) directly. Instead, we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|S) * P(S)

Solving for P(B|S):
P(B|S) = (P(B) - P(B|T) * P(T)) / P(S)

Substituting P(B) = 1 - P(B' ), we get:
P(B|S) = ((1 - P(B' )) - P(B|T) * P(T)) / P(S)

Now, we have all the values:
P(B' ) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

So,
P(B|S) = (0.2 - 0.8 * 0.15) / 0.85 ≈ 0.1059

Now, we can calculate P(T|B):
P(T|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1059 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.5765

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.5765}
