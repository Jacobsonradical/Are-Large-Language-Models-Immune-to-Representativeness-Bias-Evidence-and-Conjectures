To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

Let's denote:
- p as the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller
- w as the witness's correct identification of a person as being 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that p â‰ˆ 0.5 and that the witness is correct 80% of the time (w = 0.8) and errs 20% of the time (1-w = 0.2).

Now, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(p|w) = P(w|p) * P(p) / P(w)

We know P(w|p) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 (w), and we know P(p) (the probability of a randomly chosen person from the population being 185 cm or taller) is 0.5 (p). However, calculating P(w) requires more information about the distribution of the witness's errors.

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(w), we cannot calculate P(p|w) directly. Therefore, we cannot provide an exact estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information.
