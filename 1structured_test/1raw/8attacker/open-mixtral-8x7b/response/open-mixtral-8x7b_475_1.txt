Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, which means that taller people are more likely to be attackers (disproportionately).

b. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let P(A) represent the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm (from a), it follows that 15% are 185 cm or taller:
P(A) = 0.15

However, this does not take into account the additional information from b that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and that their identification is correct 80% of the time.

So, we should multiply P(A) by the witness's accuracy:
P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.12}
