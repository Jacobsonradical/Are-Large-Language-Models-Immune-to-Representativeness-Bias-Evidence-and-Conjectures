To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights. We will apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 * (1-0.15) = 0.16 (witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.16 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4517

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4517 or 45.17%.
