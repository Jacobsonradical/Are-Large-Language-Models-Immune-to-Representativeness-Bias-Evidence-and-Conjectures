To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. According to statement "a", the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness would have identified the attacker correctly.
2. Statement "b" indicates that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information.

Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, there is still a chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the distribution of attacker heights)

We need to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We need to find P(E), which is the probability of identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height.

Let's assume that the attacker heights are evenly distributed between two categories: under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. So, there is a 50% chance of selecting an attacker from either group.

If the attacker is under 185 cm, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify them as 185 cm or taller (P(E|¬H) = 0.2).

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)

Substituting the values:

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
