Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means the false positive rate is 20%, and the true positive rate is 80%.

b) In reality, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the false positive rate, the witness errs in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.5)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
