To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that a random person is under 185 cm.
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies a person's height.
- ~W as the event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height.

From the given information, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(~W|C) = 0.8 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(B) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(C) = 0.85 (85% of the attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. To do this, let's find P(W) and P(~W) and apply the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|C) * P(C)
P(~W) = P(~W|A) * P(A) + P(~W|C) * P(C)

We know that P(W|C) = 1 - P(~W|C) = 0.2 and P(W) + P(~W) = 1. Solving the system of equations, we get:

P(A) â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3571}
