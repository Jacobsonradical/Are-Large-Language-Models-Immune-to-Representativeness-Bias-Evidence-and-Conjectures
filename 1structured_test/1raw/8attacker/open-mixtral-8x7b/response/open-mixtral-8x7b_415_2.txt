To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define two events:
- W: The witness correctly identifies that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- T: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(W|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller) and P(T) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)

We don't have information about P(W|not T), but we can use the complementary event: P(not W) = 1 - P(W).

P(not W) = P(not W|T) * P(T) + P(not W|not T) * P(not T)

We know that P(W|T) = 0.8, P(T) = 0.15, and P(not T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85. Since the witness is equally likely to make an error in both directions, P(not W|T) = 1 - P(W|T) = 0.2. 

Solving for P(not W|not T):

0.2 = P(not W|T) * 0.15 + P(not W|not T) * 0.85
P(not W|not T) = (0.2 - 0.15 * 0.2) / 0.85 ≈ 0.1647

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.1647) * 0.85 ≈ 0.7147

Finally, we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.7147 ≈ 0.1679

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1679 (16.79%).

Answer: {probability: 0.1679}
