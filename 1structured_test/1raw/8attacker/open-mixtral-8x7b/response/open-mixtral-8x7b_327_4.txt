To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the the time. So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are given P(B | A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) and P(B) = 0.15 (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)
= P(B | A) * P(A) + P(not B | A) * P(A)

We know that P(B | A) = 0.8 and P(not B | A) = 1 - P(B | A) = 0.2. We also know that P(A) + P(not A) = 1 and P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

0.85 = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.15

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = (0.85 - 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.7875

Now we can find P(A | B):

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.7875 / 0.15
= 4.717

Since this value is greater than 1, it suggests that the witness's identification is not reliable in this case and that the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is lower than what the witness suggested.

To get a more realistic estimate, we can use the prior probability P(A) = 0.7875 as our estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.7875}
