To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally divided between those under and at/above 185 cm)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually at/above 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is not at/above 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
= 0.8889, approximately.

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8889}
