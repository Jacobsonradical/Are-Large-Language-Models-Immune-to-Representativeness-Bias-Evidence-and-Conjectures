To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement and the prevalence of attackers' heights in the population. We then combine these probabilities using the total probability rule.

1. The probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (P(W|H)) = 0.8
2. The probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (P(W|~H)) = 0.2
3. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) = 0.15 (15% of attackers)
4. The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (P(~H)) = 0.85 (85% of attackers)

Now we calculate the posterior probabilities for each scenario using the total probability rule:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / (P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|~H) * P(~H))
P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the numbers, we get:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.273

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.273}
