To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

1. Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A).
2. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
3. Therefore, we can say that P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) and P(W'|A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller), where W' is the complement of W (the witness being incorrect).
4. Similarly, we can denote P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) as P(A) and P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) as P(A').
5. From the information about the distribution of attackers' heights, we know that P(A') = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.
6. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W'|A) * P(A')]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.12}
