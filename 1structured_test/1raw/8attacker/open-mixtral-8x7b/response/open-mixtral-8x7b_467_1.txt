To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / P(W)

P(W|H) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(H) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(W), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct or the witness is mistaken.
P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)
- P(W and H) is the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
- P(W and not H) is the probability that the witness is mistaken and identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
