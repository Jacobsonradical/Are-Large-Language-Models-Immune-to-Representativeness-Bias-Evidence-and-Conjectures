Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
2. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, this probability does not take into account the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given in the second piece of information. So, let's calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

1. We know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
2. Thus, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the population statistics, is 0.15 (or 15%).

Now, let's update our probability based on the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  * P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not (which is the 20% error rate, or 0.2)
  * P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is: {probability: 0.345}
