To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness identifies 185+)

We know that P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(185+) is what we want to find
P(Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) + P(Witness identifies 185+ | <185) * P(<185)

From the problem, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so P(185+) = P(<185) = 0.5

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(Witness identifies 185+ | <185) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which accounts for 15% of the attackers, and correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases when the person is 185 cm or taller, which accounts for 85% of the attackers)

Now, we can calculate P(Witness identifies 185+):
P(Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) + P(Witness identifies 185+ | <185) * P(<185)
= 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.37 * 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.185 = 0.585

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness identifies 185+)
= 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.585 = 0.683760683761

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.68}
