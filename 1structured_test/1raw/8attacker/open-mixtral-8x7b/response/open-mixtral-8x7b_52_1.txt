Let's analyze the given information:

a) A witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This information is about the witness's ability to correctly judge a person's height, not about the attacker's height.

b) Among such attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information is about the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information.

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy, we know that the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than what the witness reported (0.8).

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the actual probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and considering the witness's accuracy, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller by calculating the weighted average of the witness's reported probability and the actual population proportion:

(0.8 * witness accuracy) + (0.2 * actual population proportion) = (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.15) = 0.64 + 0.03 = 0.67

Therefore:
{probability: 0.67}
