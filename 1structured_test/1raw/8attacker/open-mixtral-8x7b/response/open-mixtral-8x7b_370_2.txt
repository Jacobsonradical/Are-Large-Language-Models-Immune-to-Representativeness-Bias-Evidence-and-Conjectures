Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate in such judgments and a 20% error rate.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

By substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))]
P(A|B) = 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36 or 36%.
