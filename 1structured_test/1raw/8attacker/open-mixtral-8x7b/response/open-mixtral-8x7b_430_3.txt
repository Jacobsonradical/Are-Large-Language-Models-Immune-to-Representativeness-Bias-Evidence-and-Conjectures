To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, but errs 20% of the time, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

However, there is another piece of information that the witness might have identified an attacker who is actually shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, there is a higher chance that the witness erred in this way.

Let E be the event that the witness erred in identifying the attacker's height. Then:
P(E) = P(E|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.17

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the witness erred:
P(A|B and E) = P(B and E|A) * P(A) / P(B and E)

We are given:
- P(B and E|A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B and E), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B and E) = P(B and E|A) * P(A) + P(B and E|not A) * P(not A)

We are not given P(B and E|not A), but we can calculate it as follows:
P(B and E|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(E|not A) = (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B and E):
P(B and E) = P(B and E|A) * P(A) + P(B and E|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.2045

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B and E):
P(A|B and E) = P(B and E|A) * P(A) / P(B and E) = (0.2 * 0.15) / 0.2045 = 0.1467

Since the witness might have erred, we should consider both P(A|B) and P(A|B and E) to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

probability: 0.48 (if the witness did not err) + 0.1467 (if the witness erred) = 0.6267 â‰ˆ 0.63 (63%)
