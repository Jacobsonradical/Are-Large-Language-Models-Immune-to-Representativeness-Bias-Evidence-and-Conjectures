Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in estimating P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: B is true when either A is true (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) or when B is true when A is false (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
     = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to consider the witness's error rate when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A)
            = 1 - 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time in identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
     = 0.8 \* 0.15 + (1 - 0.20) \* 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.68
     = 0.80

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
       = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.80
       = 0.09 / 0.80
       = 0.1125

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1125 (or 11.25%). This is lower than the initial assumption that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (based on the witness's identification), which highlights the importance of using statistical reasoning and evidence to update our beliefs.
