To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witnessed identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller"
- C as the event "the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller"

From statement "a", we have P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(B|not C) = 0.2. We want to find P(C|B). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / [P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|not C) * P(not C)]

Now, from statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, which means 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(C) = 0.15.

Plugging the values into the formula:

P(C|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
