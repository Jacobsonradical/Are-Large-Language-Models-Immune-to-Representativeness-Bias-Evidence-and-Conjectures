Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, with 85% of attackers being in this category. 

The witness in this case identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which we know is correct 80% of the time when the witness makes such a judgment. 

To calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we multiply the base rate (the rate at which this kind of person is represented in the population) by the accuracy of the witness's judgment. 

So, the calculation would be: (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2 * 0.2) = 0.4 + 0.04 = 0.44, or 44%. 

This means that, given the information provided, there's a 44% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
