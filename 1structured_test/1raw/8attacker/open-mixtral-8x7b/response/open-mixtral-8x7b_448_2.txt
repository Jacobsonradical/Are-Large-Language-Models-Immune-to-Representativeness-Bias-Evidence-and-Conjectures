To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights. We can combine these two pieces of information to make a probabilistic estimate.

Let's break down the problem using the two pieces of information provided:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Let's assume the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. However, we also need to consider the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (15%). To account for both pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and the attacker is under 185 cm (A'). We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time when the attacker is under 185 cm. So:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
         = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
            = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
            = 0.12 / 0.29
            â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
