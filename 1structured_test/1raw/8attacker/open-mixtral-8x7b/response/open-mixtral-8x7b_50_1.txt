Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when they actually are. This is based on point "b" and is given as 80% or 0.8.

Next, let's consider the base rate probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, from point "a". This is given as 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two probabilities. Using Bayes' theorem, this would be:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know P(B|A) is 0.8 (from point "b"), and P(A) is 0.15 (from point "a"). We need to find P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of probabilities for each possibility - in this case, there are two possibilities: the person is 185 cm or taller, or they are not. 

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
