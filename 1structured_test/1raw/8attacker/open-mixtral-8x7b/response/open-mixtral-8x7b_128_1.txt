To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

1. We know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're correct.

2. However, since the attacker is more likely to be under 185 cm (85% of the time), we must consider the base rate of attackers with that height. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is only 15%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can compute the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the information we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are and 20% of the time when they aren't, P(B|not A) = 0.2 and P(not A) = 0.85:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, plug the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41
