To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller;
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we can compute P(B|A) as the witness's ability to correctly judge a person's height: P(B|A) = 0.8. Similarly, we can compute P(B|¬A) as the witness's tendency to mistakenly judge a person's height: P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Furthermore, we are given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now, by applying Bayes' theorem, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
