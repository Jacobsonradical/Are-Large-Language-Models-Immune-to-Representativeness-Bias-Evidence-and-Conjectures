Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This suggests that even though there are many people of this height, they are less likely to be attackers.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if a person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which matches 80% of the time when the attacker is actually that height. But it also mismatches 20% of the time when the attacker is not that height. Since we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the probability of this event occurring (a match) is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%.

However, we must also consider the possibility that the witness mismatched (i.e., incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller), which happens 20% of the time when the person is not actually that tall. Given that 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, the probability of this event occurring (a mismatch) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 or 17%.

Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities to get our final estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is 12% + 17% = 29%.

So, {probability: 0.29}
