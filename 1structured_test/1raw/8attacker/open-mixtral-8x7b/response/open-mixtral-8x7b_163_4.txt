Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that 50% of attackers are shorter and 50% are taller. 

However, we are told that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so we need to adjust our calculation:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We know:
- P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) + (P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
