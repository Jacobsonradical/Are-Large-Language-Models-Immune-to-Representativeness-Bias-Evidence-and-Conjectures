Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identifies the attacker as such, is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, is also 0.8.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(A) = 0.15.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To find P(B|not A), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
