Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person)
P(error) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

According to the first piece of information, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness ID) = [P(witness ID | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(witness ID)

We know P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(witness ID | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the witness's 80% accuracy). We need to calculate P(witness ID), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(witness ID) = P(witness ID | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness ID | under 185 cm) * P(under 185 cm)

We know P(witness ID | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(under 185 cm) = 1 - P(185 cm or taller) = 0.85. We still need to find P(witness ID | under 185 cm), which is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:

P(witness ID | under 185 cm) = 0.2 (from the witness's 20% error rate)

Now, we can calculate P(witness ID):

P(witness ID) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(185 cm or taller | witness ID) = [P(witness ID | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(witness ID)
P(185 cm or taller | witness ID) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
