To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness identifies tall)

From (a), P(witness identifies tall | attacker is tall) = 0.8 and P(attacker is tall) = 0.15 (from (b))

To calculate P(witness identifies tall), we can use the law of total probability:
P(witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) + P(witness identifies tall | attacker is not tall) * P(attacker is not tall)

From (a), P(witness identifies tall | attacker is not tall) = 0.2 and P(attacker is not tall) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(witness identifies tall):
P(witness identifies tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(tall | witness identifies tall):
P(tall | witness identifies tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
