Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.
3. So, if we were to assume that the witness's identification is accurate, we would overestimate the attacker's height.
4. To find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
   where A is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller".

5. We are given:
   P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
   P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
   P(B|~A) = 0.2 (probability of mistakenly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller)
   P(~A) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

6. We can find P(B) using the law of total probability:
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

7. Now we can find P(A|B):
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
