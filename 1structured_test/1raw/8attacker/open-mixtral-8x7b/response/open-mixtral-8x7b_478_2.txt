Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given this information. To do this, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event "attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and B be the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We're looking for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information given, P(B|A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) (the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct or the witness is incorrect:

- P(B and A) is the probability of the witness being correct (0.8) times the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(B and not A) is the probability of the witness being incorrect (0.2) times the probability of the attacker being under 185 cm (0.85) since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.345}
