Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 80% = 0.8
P(incorrect ID) = 20% = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50-50 chance for either type of person in the population. Therefore:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(correct ID) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.5
= 0.4

We also need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(incorrect ID) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.2 * 0.5
= 0.1

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, by applying Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of probabilities calculated above:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.4 * 0.5 + 0.1 * 0.5
= 0.25

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.4 * 0.5) / 0.25
= 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
