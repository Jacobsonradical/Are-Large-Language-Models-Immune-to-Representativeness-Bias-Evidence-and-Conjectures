Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attacks are disproportionately attributed to those under 185 cm, making up 85% of such attackers. This suggests that even though the population is evenly split, there may be more smaller people committing attacks.

However, we have additional information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The court assessed this witness as having an 80% success rate in judging a person's height under similar conditions, with a 20% error rate.

Given these facts, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as the product of the witness's accuracy and the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker would be 185 cm or taller, given the disproportionate number of attacks by shorter individuals.

First, let's calculate the prior probability. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and assuming attacks are independent events, the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

Next, let's incorporate the witness's accuracy. The witness was correct 80% of the time. Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the product of the witness's accuracy and the prior probability:

0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
