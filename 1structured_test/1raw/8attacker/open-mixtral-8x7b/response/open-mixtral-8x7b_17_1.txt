Based on the information provided, there are two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

a. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

b. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. Similarly, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

To estimate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1-0.15)]
= 0.15 / [0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
= 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.517

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.517}.
