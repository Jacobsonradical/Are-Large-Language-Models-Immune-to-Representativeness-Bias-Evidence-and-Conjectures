Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The probability of them making an error, i.e., identifying someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, is given as 20% or 0.2.

The scenario describes that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm are equal, so the probability of the attacker being under or over 185 cm is 50% each, or 0.5.

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to find the post-identification probability that this statement is true. This is a classic problem of updating our beliefs based on new evidence, and it can be solved using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(B) can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
â‰ˆ 0.6667

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.6667}
