To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:
P(Tall | Identified Tall) = P(Identified Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Identified Tall)

We are given:
P(Identified Tall | Tall) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(Tall) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(Identified Tall) = P(Identified Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Identified Tall | Short) * P(Short)

Now, we need to find P(Identified Tall | Short), the probability of the witness identifying a short attacker as tall. We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time, so:
P(Identified Tall | Short) = 0.2

We also know that the population of short and tall people is roughly equal, so:
P(Short) = P(Tall) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(Identified Tall):
P(Identified Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
P(Tall | Identified Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
