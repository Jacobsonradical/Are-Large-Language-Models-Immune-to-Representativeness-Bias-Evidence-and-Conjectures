Given the two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the given probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is 0.8 (80%).

However, statement "b" suggests that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. To account for this additional information, we need to multiply our initial estimate by the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, and then divide by the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:

P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80%)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%)
P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since half the population is 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = 0.8 x 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.24 (24%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 24%.
