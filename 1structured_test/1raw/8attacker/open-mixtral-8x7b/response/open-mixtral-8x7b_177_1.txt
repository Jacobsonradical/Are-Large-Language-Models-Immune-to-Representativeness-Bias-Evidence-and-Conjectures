Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the person is shorter than 185 cm):

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)] / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, so P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5.

To calculate P(identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to take into account all possibilities:
- P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actual height is shorter than 185 cm) * P(actual height is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.667}
