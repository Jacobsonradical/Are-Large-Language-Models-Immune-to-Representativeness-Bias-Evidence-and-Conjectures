Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8
P(incorrect ID) = 0.2

From statement (a), we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification, is 0.12 or 12%.
