To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness's assessment has a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.8 and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.2.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller | witness assessment) = P(witness assessment | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness assessment)

We are given that P(witness assessment | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (PPV), P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(witness assessment) as follows:

P(witness assessment) = P(witness assessment | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness assessment | not 185 cm or taller) \* P(not 185 cm or taller)

P(witness assessment) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) \* (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, we can calculate P(185 cm or taller | witness assessment) as:

P(185 cm or taller | witness assessment) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
