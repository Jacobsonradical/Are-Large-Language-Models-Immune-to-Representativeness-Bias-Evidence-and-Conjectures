Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more likely to become attackers due to their larger numbers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller under these conditions.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness is correct 80% of the time, or with a probability of 0.8, and incorrect 20% of the time, or with a probability of 0.2.

Next, we need to take into account the base rates of people being 185 cm or taller in the population. Since the population is roughly evenly split between those below and above 185 cm, the base rate is 0.5 (50%).

To calculate the probability that the witness is correct given the base rates, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness reports 185 cm) = [P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm)] / P(Witness reports 185 cm)

P(Witness reports 185 cm) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and incorrect:

P(Witness reports 185 cm) = P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) + P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm)

We know the values of all the other terms except for P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm). However, we can derive this value from the witness's error rate:

P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm) = 1 - P(Witness reports NOT 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm)

The witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was NOT 185 cm, so:

P(Witness reports NOT 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now,

P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm) = 1 - P(Witness reports NOT 185 cm | Attacker is NOT 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(Witness reports 185 cm):

P(Witness reports 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness reports 185 cm):

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness reports 185 cm) = [P(Witness reports 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm)] / P(Witness reports 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
