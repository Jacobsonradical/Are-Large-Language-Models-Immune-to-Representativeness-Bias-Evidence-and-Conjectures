Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This indicates that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy and a 20% error rate.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller attacker 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equally split between heights below and above 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equally split between heights below and above 185 cm)

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
