To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A' ): Probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm.
- P(B' | A' ): Probability that the witness identifies a person as under 185 cm given that the person is actually under 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B'|A' ) = 0.8 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as under 185 cm 20% of the time when the person is actually under 185 cm)
P(A') = 0.5 (roughly equal population of people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
P(A|B') = 0.1667 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.8 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.1667)))

Calculating the result:
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.273

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.273}
