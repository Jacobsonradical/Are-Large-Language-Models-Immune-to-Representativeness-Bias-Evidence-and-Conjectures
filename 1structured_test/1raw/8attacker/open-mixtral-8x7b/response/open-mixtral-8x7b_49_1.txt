To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the observed information.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equal in size)

We need to find P(B), the probability of observing the given information if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and if the attacker is shorter than 1
