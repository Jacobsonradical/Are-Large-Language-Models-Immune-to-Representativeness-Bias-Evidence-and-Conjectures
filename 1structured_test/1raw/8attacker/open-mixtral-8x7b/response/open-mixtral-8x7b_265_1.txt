Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under similar conditions is 80% accurate (correct identification) with a 20% error rate (incorrect identification).

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8 or 80%).
P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15 or 15% based on part a).
P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller; this can be broken down into two parts:
- P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12 (witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller)

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the final probability:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.414}
