Let's reason through this problem:

We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are taller. This information suggests that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people.

Now, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 1
