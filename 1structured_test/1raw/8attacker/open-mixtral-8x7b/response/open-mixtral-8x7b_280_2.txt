To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(!A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(B|!A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of cases when the person is under 185 cm)

We want to find: P(A|B)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.413793103 (rounded to 11 decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.413793103}
