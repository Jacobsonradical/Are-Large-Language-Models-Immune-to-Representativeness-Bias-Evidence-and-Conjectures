Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. It's roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, with 85% of them being so, and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

The witness, however, identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information. The witness's identification gives us some information, but we also need to account for the fact that attackers are more likely to be shorter.

Let's denote:
- P(A): The probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that a reported attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.2818 or 28.18%.
