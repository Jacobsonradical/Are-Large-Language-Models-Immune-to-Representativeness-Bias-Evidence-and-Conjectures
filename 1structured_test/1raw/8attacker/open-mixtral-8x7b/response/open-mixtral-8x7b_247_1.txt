To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the probabilities and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from statement a)

Next, let's find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (from statement a, since the witness erred in 20% of cases)

Now, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm using the given information:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from statement b, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (from statement b, since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness says 185 cm or taller)

We can find P(witness says 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:
P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the final probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says 185 cm or taller) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.38 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.38}
