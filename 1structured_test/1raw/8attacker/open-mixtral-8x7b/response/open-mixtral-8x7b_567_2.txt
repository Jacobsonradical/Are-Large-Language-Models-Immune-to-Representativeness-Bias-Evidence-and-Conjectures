Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This suggests that even though there are many people of that height, they are less likely to be attackers.

Next, let's consider the reliability of the witness. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

We start with the prior probability, which is the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, i.e., 0.15. 

Then we multiply this by the likelihood, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height, i.e., 0.8. 

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

However, this is a simplistic calculation and does not take into account the possibility that the witness might be more likely to incorrectly identify someone as being 185 cm or taller (perhaps due to a psychological bias towards identifying the attacker as a taller person). To account for this, we could also consider the false positive rate, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, i.e., 0.2.

In this case, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / 
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We know that:
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the likelihood)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (the prior probability)
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 
P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate the second term as follows:

P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (the false positive rate)
P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

So, P(witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 
0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting these values into the posterior probability formula, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 
0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Therefore, based on the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345 (34.5%).
