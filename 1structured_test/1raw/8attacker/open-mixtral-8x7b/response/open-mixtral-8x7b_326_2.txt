To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's find the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller:
P(Correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's find the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:
P(Incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller | Shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, let's use the information about the distribution of attacker heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the information about the attacker:

P(185 cm or taller | Attacker) = P(Attacker | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(Attacker)

We don't have direct information about P(Attacker | 185 cm or taller) and P(Attacker), but we can make some assumptions. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, and 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, it's reasonable to assume that the probability of an attacker being taller than 185 cm is 0.15, and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(185 cm or taller | Attacker):

P(185 cm or taller | Attacker) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.308

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.308.
