To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B and A):
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A)
= (0.8) * (0.15)
= 0.12

Next, we need to find P(B). We can do this by considering the two possible cases: the attacker is either 185 cm or taller (A), or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
