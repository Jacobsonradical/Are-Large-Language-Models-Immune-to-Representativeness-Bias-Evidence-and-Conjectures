To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = 0.8

However, we need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(tall) = P(tall and witness identifies tall) + P(tall and witness identifies short)

P(tall) = P(tall) * P(witness identifies tall | tall) + P(short) * P(witness identifies tall | short)

Let's plug in the values we know:

P(tall) = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2

P(tall) = 0.15 + 0.17

P(tall) = 0.32

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.32}
