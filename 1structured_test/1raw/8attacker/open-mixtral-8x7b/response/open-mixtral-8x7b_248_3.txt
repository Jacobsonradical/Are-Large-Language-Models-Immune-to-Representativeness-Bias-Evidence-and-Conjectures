Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under similar conditions is 80% accurate (correct identification) and 20% inaccurate (incorrect identification).

Given these pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

We know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness identified the attacker as being in this category with 80% accuracy. So, the probability estimate that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is:

Probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0 (since there's no probability for the complementary scenario, i.e., the witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are actually taller)

Which simplifies to:

Probability: 0.12

Please note that this is an estimate based on the given information and the witness's accuracy. The actual probability may differ depending on other factors not provided in the question.
