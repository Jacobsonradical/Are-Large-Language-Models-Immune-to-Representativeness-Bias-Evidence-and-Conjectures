To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume that the witness's ability to judge a person's height is independent of the attacker's actual height. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Then,

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and we need to find P(B) to calculate P(A|B).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, and we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

To find P(B|not A), we can use the fact that the witness erred 20% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Putting it all together, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85 = 0.84

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.84 = 0.136

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.136}
