To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, compute P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, compute P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) ≈ 0.3158

Answer: {probability: 0.3158}
