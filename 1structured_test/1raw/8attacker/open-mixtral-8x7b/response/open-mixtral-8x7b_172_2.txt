Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we cannot directly calculate the probability, but we can estimate it. The witness's accuracy is still relevant, even though the attacker's height seems unusual based on the proportions of attackers. The witness may still be correct, despite the atypical height.

To estimate the probability, we can use the witness's accuracy to weigh the two possibilities:
- The attacker is 185 cm or taller (80% chance of being correct)
- The attacker is not 185 cm or taller (20% chance of being incorrect)

Based on the witness's accuracy, we have a higher probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
