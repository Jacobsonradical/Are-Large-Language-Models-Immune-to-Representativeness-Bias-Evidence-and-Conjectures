Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. There is an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm (85% vs 15%). 

The witness in this case identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is a positive assertion about the attacker's height. However, the witness is not perfect and makes errors 20% of the time.

Given these facts, we want to estimate the probability that an attacker who is identified as 185 cm or taller by this witness is actually 185 cm or taller. We can set this up as a conditional probability problem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can expand this as:

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

From the problem, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies them as such 20% of the time. Therefore, P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Given that attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is less than 0.5, but we don't have an exact number. However, since the witness is more likely to correctly identify taller attackers, even if P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is quite small, the overall probability P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) could still be relatively high.

To estimate this probability, let's consider different values of P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller). If P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.1, then:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.1) / ((0.8 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.9)) = 0.29 (approximately)

If P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.2, then:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.2) / ((0.8 * 0.2) + (0.2 * 0.8)) = 0.4 (exactly)

If P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3, then:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.3) / ((0.8 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.7)) = 0.51 (approximately)

Based on these calculations, even if the baseline probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is quite low (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2), the conditional probability given the witness identification is still reasonably high (0.29 or 0.4, respectively). If the baseline probability is higher (e.g., 0.3), the conditional probability is even higher (0.51).

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is:

{probability: between 0.4 and 0.51, with a stronger leaning towards 0.51 if the attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller}
