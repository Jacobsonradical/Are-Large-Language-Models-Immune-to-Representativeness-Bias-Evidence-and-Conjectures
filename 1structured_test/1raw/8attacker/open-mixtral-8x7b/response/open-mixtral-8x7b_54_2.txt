To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's denote:
A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem definition we know:
1. P(B|A) - the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
2. P(A) - the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people taller and shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal, but only 15% of attacks come from people 185 cm or taller, this probability is 0.15.
3. P(B) - the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is what we need to calculate now.

We can write P(B) as a sum of two probabilities:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

The first term, P(B and A), is the probability of both the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is equal to P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The second term, P(B and not A), is the probability of both the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:
- The probability of the witness identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).
- The probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.

So, P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate P(B) as the sum of these two probabilities:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

Answer: {probability: 0.345}
