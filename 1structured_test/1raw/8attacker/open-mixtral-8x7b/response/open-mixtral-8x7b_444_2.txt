Let's break down the given information:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(Taller | Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness)

We are given:
P(Witness | Taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a taller attacker 80% of the time)
P(Taller) = 0.15 (15% of the attacker population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(Witness), which can be calculated as:
P(Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) * P(Shorter)

We're given:
P(Witness | Shorter) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(Shorter) = 0.85 (85% of the attacker population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(Witness):
P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
