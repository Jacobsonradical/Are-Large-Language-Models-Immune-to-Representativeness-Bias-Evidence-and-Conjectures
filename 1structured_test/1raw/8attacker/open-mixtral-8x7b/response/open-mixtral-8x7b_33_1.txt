To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that a randomly chosen attacker from this attack type is 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
- P(A|witness) = 0.8 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification)
- P(B) = 0.15 (probability that a randomly chosen attacker from this attack type is 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(A). Instead, we can use P(B) to estimate P(A). Since the witnessed attack is a single event, we cannot precisely calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. But we can make an educated guess based on the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
