To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and P(E) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(T|E), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|E) = P(E|T) * P(T) / P(E)

We are given P(E|T) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller) and P(T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|T) * P(T) + P(E|not T) * P(not T)

We are given P(E|T) = 0.8, and we need to find P(E|not T). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(not E|not T) = 0.8, and P(E|not T) = 1 - P(not E|not T) = 0.2.

We are also given P(not T) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(T|E):

P(T|E) = P(E|T) * P(T) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
