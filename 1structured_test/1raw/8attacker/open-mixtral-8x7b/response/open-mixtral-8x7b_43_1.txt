Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker correctly and misidentifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

Now, let's calculate the probability that a person randomly selected from the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size for those shorter and 185 cm or taller, this probability is 0.5.

Finally, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is the product of the two probabilities calculated above: 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person) multiplied by 0.5 (population probability). This gives us 0.4.

However, this is not the final answer. We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem, this probability is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We already have P(B|A) (0.8), P(A) (0.5), and we need to calculate P(B), which is the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(B|C)) multiplied by P(C), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)) multiplied by P(A):

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|A) * P(A)

We know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter. The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter. So,

P(B|C) = 0.2
P(C) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.17 + 0.4 = 0.57

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.57 â‰ˆ 0.6667

{probability: 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)}
