Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, given the disproportionate number of attacks coming from that group.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate for this height range. This also implies a 20% error rate for the witness.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that a witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (based on point a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (based on point b, the witness's correct identification rate)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (based on point b, the witness's error rate, so the false identification rate)

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to compute P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability, we calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We already have the values for P(B|A), P(A), and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A). Plugging them in, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.29) ≈ 0.345

However, it is more intuitive to express this probability as a percentage:
