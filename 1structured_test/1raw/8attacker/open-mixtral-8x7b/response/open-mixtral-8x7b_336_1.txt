To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185+ | Witness Identified as 185+) = P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) \* P(185+) / P(Witness Identified as 185+)

We are given:
P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) = 0.8
P(185+) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is:

P(Witness Identified as 185+) = P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) \* P(185+) + P(Witness Identified as 185+ | <185cm) \* P(<185cm)

Since we know the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have:

P(Witness Identified as 185+ | <185cm) = 0.2
P(<185cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(Witness Identified as 185+):

P(Witness Identified as 185+) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(185+ | Witness Identified as 185+):

P(185+ | Witness Identified as 185+) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
