Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. Let's denote this event as A.

The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens in 20% of cases where the true height is less than 185 cm, and in 100% of cases where the true height is 185 cm or taller. The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

P(A|witness) = P(A and attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness)

The event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" is denoted as H, and the event "witness" is the observation of the witness.

P(A and H) = P(H) = probability of being 185 cm or taller
P(witness) = P(witness|H) * P(H) + P(witness|not H) * P(not H)

We know that:
- P(witness|H) = 1 (the witness always says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(witness|not H) = 0.8 (the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the attacker is less than 185 cm)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are less than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|witness):

P(A|witness) = P(A and H) / P(witness)
= P(H) / (P(witness|H) * P(H) + P(witness|not H) * P(not H))
= 0.15 / (1 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85)
= 0.15 / 0.765
â‰ˆ 0.1957

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.1957.
