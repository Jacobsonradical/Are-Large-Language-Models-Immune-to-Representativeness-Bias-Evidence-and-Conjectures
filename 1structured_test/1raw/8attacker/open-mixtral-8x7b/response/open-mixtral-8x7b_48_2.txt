Given the information, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that even though the population is split equally, the attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

2. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let's assume the total population is 100 people. According to point 1, 50 people are shorter than 185 cm, and 50 people are 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given their 80% accuracy rate, we can calculate the probability as follows:

True Positives (TP) = 0.8 * 50 = 40 (when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
False Positives (FP) = 0.2 * 50 = 10 (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

The total number of possible positive identifications (TP + FP) is 40 + 10 = 50.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

probability: 0.8 (or 80%)

This answer is based on the assumption that the attacker is equally likely to be from either height group, which is given in the problem statement. However, considering the attacker distribution information in point 1, one might argue that the actual probability should be lower. Nonetheless, based on the provided information and the witness's ability to judge height, the estimated probability is 80%.
