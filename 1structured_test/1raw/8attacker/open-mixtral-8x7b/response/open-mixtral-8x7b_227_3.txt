To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified people 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller and erred 20% of the time.
2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A), the probability that the witness identified the attacker's height correctly as P(B|A), and the probability that the witness identified the attacker's height correctly when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller as P(B|¬A).

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)

P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness erred 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
