To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b". 

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or the witness is incorrect and the attacker is under 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
