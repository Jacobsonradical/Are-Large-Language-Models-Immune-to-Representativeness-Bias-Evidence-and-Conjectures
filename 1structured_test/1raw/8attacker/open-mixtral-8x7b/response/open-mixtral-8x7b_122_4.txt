Given the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
C = The attacker is 185 cm or taller

From the question, we have the following probabilities:
P(A|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
P(B|A) = ?
P(C) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(C') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8, but let's derive it from the data:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, using Bayes' theorem:
P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can express P(B) as the sum of two probabilities, P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|A') * P(A').

P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an under-185 cm person 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now, we can rewrite Bayes' theorem as:
P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

Solving for P(A):
P(A) = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17)

Multiplying both sides by (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17):
0.8 * P(A) = 0.8 * P(A)^2 + 0.17 * P(A)

Rearranging:
0.8 * P(A)^2 - 0.63 * P(A) - 0.17 = 0

This is a quadratic equation. Solving for P(A), we find two solutions:
P(A) = 1 (which is trivial, since we know P(A) <= 1)
P(A) = 0.2247

We choose the solution between 0 and 1:

{probability: 0.2247}
