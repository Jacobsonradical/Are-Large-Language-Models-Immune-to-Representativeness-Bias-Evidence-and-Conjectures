Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means the witness has a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 0.8 and a false positive rate (1 - specificity) of 0.2.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of people taller than 185 cm)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker can be either shorter or taller than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability to calculate this:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is 0.2 (20% chance of guessing incorrectly).

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
