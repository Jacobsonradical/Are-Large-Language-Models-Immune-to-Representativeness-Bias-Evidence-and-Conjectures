To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E) as the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B) = 0.8 and P(!B) = 0.2, where !B represents the event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Additionally, we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15 and P(!A) = 0.85, where !A represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

To find P(E), we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(E) = P(A and B) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(A and B). We know that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Also, the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(!A) * P(B|!A)
P(A and B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(E):
P(E) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.29 / 0.8 = 0.3625

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3625}
