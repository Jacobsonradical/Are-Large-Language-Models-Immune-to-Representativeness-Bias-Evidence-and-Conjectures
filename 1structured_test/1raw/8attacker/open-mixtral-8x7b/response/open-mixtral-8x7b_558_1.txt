To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider two scenarios:
1. The attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness will correctly identify the attacker's height 80% of the time.
2. The attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are under 185 cm). In this case, the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Estimated probability = (probability of correct identification * probability of being 185 cm or taller) / (probability of correct identification * probability of being 185 cm or taller) + (probability of incorrect identification * probability of not being 185 cm or taller)

Estimated probability = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Estimated probability â‰ˆ 0.288

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.288 or 28.8%.
