To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, this implies that the witness's statement is more likely to be correct than not.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that it is more likely that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can write Bayes' theorem as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller; P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller; and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and we are given that P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm), and P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller.

We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138.
