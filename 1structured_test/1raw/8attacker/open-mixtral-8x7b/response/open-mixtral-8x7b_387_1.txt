To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness's testimony has a true positive rate (sensitivity) of 0.8 and a false positive rate (1 - specificity) of 0.2.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

posterior probability = (prior probability * sensitivity) / ((prior probability * sensitivity) + (1 - prior probability) * false positive rate)

posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2))

posterior probability = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
