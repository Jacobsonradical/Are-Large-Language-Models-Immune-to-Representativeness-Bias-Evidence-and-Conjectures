To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness would identify the attacker correctly and a 20% chance that the witness would identify the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that if we randomly select an attacker, there is an 85% chance that the attacker would be shorter than 185 cm and a 15% chance that the attacker would be 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can combine these two probabilities. Let's use the following notation:

* P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We are interested in estimating P(A), but we only have information about P(B|A) and P(A|B). We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(A):

P(A) = P(B) \* P(A|B) / P(B|A)

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 and that P(A) = 0.15 (the distribution of attackers' heights). However, we don't have information about P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To estimate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + P(B|not A) \* 0.85

We don't have information about P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. However, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can estimate that P(B|not A) is approximately 0.2.

This gives us:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Substituting this value into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A) = 0.35 \* 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.0525 / 0.8 = 0.0656

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.0656 or 6.56%.
