To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the prior probability based on the distribution of people's heights. We will apply Bayes' theorem to calculate this.

First, let's denote:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (the witness erred and identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which happens 20% of the time, and given that 85% of attackers are shorter)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)
= 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.1445)
≈ 0.5115

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 51.15%.
