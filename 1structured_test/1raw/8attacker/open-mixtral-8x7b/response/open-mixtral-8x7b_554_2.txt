Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define two events:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = The witness correctly identified the attacker's height

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
