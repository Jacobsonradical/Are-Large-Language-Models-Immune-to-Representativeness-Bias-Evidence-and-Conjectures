Given the information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

1. We know that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at/above 185 cm. So, the probability of randomly choosing an attacker who is at/above 185 cm is 0.5 (or 50%).

2. However, the witness stated that 85% of such attacks come from people under 185 cm, and 15% from people at/above 185 cm. So, the prior probability of an attacker being at/above 185 cm, given the attack, is 0.15 (or 15%).

3. But, the witness also correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time. So, there's an 80% chance that the witness's identification is correct.

4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was at/above 185 cm, given the witness's statement, is the product of the two probabilities: 0.15 (prior) x 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
