Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker correctly and the probability of them making an error when identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so the probability of them identifying an attacker of this height correctly is 0.8 (or 80%).

The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so the probability of them making this error when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (or 20%).

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. This is calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We are given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

We are also given that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

However, we do not have enough information to calculate P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller). To do this, we would need to know the overall probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which depends on the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

Without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, we can say that based on the witness's identification, the probability is higher than the base rate of 0.15.

Answer: {probability: cannot be determined without additional information}
