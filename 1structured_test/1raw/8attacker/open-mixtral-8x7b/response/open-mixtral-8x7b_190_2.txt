Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let event A be "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information given:
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.360

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.360 or 36%.
