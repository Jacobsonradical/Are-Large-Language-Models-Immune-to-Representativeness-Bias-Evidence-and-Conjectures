To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the two events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(B|¬A):
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.68 = 1.48

Since P(B) should be a probability, we need to normalize it:
P(B) = 1.48 / (1.48 + 1.48) = 1.48 / 2.96 ≈ 0.5

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.68) ≈ 0.09 / 0.77 ≈ 0.1169

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1169}
