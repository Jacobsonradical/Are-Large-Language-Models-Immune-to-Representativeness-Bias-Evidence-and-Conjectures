To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We will use the witness's ability to judge height to calculate the probability of the witness being correct or incorrect, and then combine this with the distribution of attackers' heights to determine the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

1. Calculate the probability of the witness being correct:
witness_correct = 0.8

2. Calculate the probability of the witness being incorrect:
witness_incorrect = 1 - witness_correct = 0.2

3. Calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
p_185_or_taller = 0.15

4. Calculate the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:
p_shorter = 1 - p_185_or_taller = 0.85

5. Calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(witness_tall | attacker_tall) = witness_correct = 0.8

6. Calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:
P(witness_tall | attacker_short) = witness_incorrect = 0.2

7. Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(attacker_tall | witness_tall) = [P(witness_tall | attacker_tall) * p_185_or_taller] / [P(witness_tall | attacker_tall) * p_185_or_taller + P(witness_tall | attacker_short) * p_shorter]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
