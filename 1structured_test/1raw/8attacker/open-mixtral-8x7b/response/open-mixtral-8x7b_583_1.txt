To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's define our events:
A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The observed information about the attacker

From statement "a", we have:
P(A) = Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since populations are roughly equal)
P(B|A) = Probability of witness identifying height correctly = 0.8
P(!A) = Probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.5
P(B|!A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying height = 0.2

From statement "b", we have:
P(B) = Probability of this particular observation (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(B) = 0.85 * P(!A) + 0.15 * P(A) = 0.85 * 0.5 + 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.525

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.525 â‰ˆ 0.7619 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.7619}
