To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, which we'll denote as P(C|T). We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. So, P(C|T) = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which we'll denote as P(C|S). We are given that the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So, P(C|S) = 0.2.

We are also given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, which we'll denote as P(T). And, since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can say that P(S) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(T|C) = [P(C|T) * P(T)] / [P(C|T) * P(T) + P(C|S) * P(S)]

Substituting the given values:

P(T|C) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(T|C) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(T|C) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(T|C) = 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
