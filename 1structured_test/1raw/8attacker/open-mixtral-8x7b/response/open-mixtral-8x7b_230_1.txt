Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (in this case, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8)
- P(A) is the probability of A (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of B (in this case, the probability that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying the height and the probabilities of the witness erring)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We know that P(B and A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as 185 cm or taller, which is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

We also know that P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

The probability that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, P(B|not A), is the probability that the witness errs, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, P(B and not A) is P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
