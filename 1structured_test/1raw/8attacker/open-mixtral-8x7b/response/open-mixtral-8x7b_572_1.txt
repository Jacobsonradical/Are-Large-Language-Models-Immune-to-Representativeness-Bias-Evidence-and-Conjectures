To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use both pieces of information provided. 

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken. 

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Even though the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, only 15% of attackers are at or above 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is at or above 185 cm as P(A), the witness saying the attacker is at or above 185 cm as W, and the prior probability of the attacker being at or above 185 cm as P(A|W). Then, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / (P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A))

We know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are at or above 185 cm), P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness is mistaken 20% of the time), and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm). Plugging these values in, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
