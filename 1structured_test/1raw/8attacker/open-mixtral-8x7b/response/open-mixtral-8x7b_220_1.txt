To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(taller | witness identified taller) = P(witness identified taller | taller) * P(taller) / P(witness identified taller)

We are given:
P(witness identified taller | taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
P(taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(witness identified taller), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is taller and where the attacker is shorter. We are given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying taller people and errs 20% of the time. Thus:

P(witness identified taller | taller) = 0.8
P(witness identified taller | shorter) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time)

Now we need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller:

P(witness identified taller) = P(witness identified taller | taller) * P(taller) + P(witness identified taller | shorter) * P(shorter)
P(witness identified taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(taller | witness identified taller) = P(witness identified taller | taller) * P(taller) / P(witness identified taller)
P(taller | witness identified taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345.
