Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

From statement (a), we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

To calculate P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller), we need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is a weighted sum of the correct and incorrect identifications:

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Correctly identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.3448

Format answer: {probability: 0.3448}
