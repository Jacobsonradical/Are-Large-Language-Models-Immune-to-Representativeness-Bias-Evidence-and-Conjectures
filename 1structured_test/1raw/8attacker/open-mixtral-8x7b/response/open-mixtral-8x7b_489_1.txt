Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) (the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
- P(A) (the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from point a)

We need to find P(B), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for two cases:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (P(B|A) * P(A))
2. The attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness incorrectly identifies them as such (P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B|not A) (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (from point b)

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) ≈ 0.25 + 0.17
P(B) ≈ 0.42

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42
P(A|B) ≈ 0.18

In the requested format:
