Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and 20% error rate for such judgments.

Given these points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) (probability of correctly identifying an attacker of that height) is 0.8.
- P(A) (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (from point a).

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct (event C) or the witness is incorrect (event D). Thus, P(B) = P(B and C) + P(B and D).

We know:
- P(B and C) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
- P(B and D) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / P(B)

After calculating P(B), we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4762

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4762}
