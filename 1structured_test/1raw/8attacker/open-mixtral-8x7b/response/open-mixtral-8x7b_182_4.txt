To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness correctly identifies attacker's height) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values we know:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 x 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
