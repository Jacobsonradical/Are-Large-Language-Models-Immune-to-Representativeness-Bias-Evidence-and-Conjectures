To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller,
- P(B' ): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm,
- P(A|B): probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such,
- P(B|A): probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time) and P(A' ) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm). Also, P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') (total probability).

We need to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

First, let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') = 0.8*0.15 + P(B|A')*0.85

Now, we need to find P(B|A'), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the complement of the witness being correct when identifying the height, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% chance of error).
So, P(B|A') = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) = (0.8*0.15)/0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
