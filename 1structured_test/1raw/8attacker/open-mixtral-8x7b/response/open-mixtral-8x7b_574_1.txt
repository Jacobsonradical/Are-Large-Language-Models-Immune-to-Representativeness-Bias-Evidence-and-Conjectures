Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. We'll call this P(W|T), the probability of the witness event (W) given the true height (T).

Next, we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not (P(W|F)), which is given as 20%.

From statement (a), we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (P(T)), is 0.15.

Applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(T|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

First, substitute P(W|T) = 0.8, P(W|F) = 0.2, and P(T) = 0.15 into the equation:

P(T|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Now, calculate the values inside the brackets:

P(T|W) = [0.12] / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

Lastly, divide 0.12 by the sum of 0.12 and 0.17:

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
