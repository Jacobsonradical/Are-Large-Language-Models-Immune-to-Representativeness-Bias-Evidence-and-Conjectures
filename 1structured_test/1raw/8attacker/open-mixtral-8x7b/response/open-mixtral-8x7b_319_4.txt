To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We are given that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time. We are also given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). We want to find P(A) given the witness's observation.

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability of this observation given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from the witness's 80% accuracy).

However, we also need to consider the probability of this observation given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness would incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (from the witness's 20% error rate). Since 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, the probability of this observation given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A) as follows:

P(A) = P(Observation | A) * P(A) / (P(Observation | A) * P(A) + P(Observation | not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85)

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.3125}
