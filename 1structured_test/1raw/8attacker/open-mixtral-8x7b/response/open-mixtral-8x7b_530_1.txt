To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct identification)
- P(not B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (1 - witness correct identification)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (probability of attacker being under 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error identification)

Plugging these values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.8)
P(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.16)
P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.31
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4839

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4839.
