To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's report.

Witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time, so:
P(taller | correct witness) = 0.8

But the witness also errs 20% of the time, so:
P(taller | incorrect witness) = 1 - P(shorter | incorrect witness) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Since we have no information about whether the witness was correct or not, we can average these two probabilities:

P(taller) = 0.5 * P(taller | correct witness) + 0.5 * P(taller | incorrect witness) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.8

Now, let's adjust this probability based on the distribution of attackers' heights.

85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the distribution:

P(taller | distribution) = 0.15

To combine these two probabilities, we can use the principle of *total probability*:

P(taller) = P(taller | correct witness) * P(correct witness) + P(taller | incorrect witness) * P(incorrect witness)

We already have P(taller | correct witness) = 0.8 and P(taller | incorrect witness) = 0.8. To calculate P(correct witness) and P(incorrect witness), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(correct witness) = P(witness is correct | taller) * P(taller) + P(witness is correct | shorter) * P(shorter)

We are given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so:
P(taller) = P(shorter) = 0.5

We are also given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so:
P(witness is correct | taller) = 0.8

And the witness errs 20% of the time, so:
P(witness is correct | shorter) = 1 - P(witness is incorrect | shorter) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(correct witness) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.8 * 0.5) = 0.8

Since P(incorrect witness) = 1 - P(correct witness) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

We can now calculate the final probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, using the principle of total probability:

P(taller) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.64 + 0.16 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
