Let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. We also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(185+ | Witness Identified as 185+) = P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness Identified as 185+)

We are given:
- P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- P(185+) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find:
- P(Witness Identified as 185+)

This is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. Since the witness can make errors, this includes both the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is not:
P(Witness Identified as 185+) = P(Witness Identified as 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) + P(Witness Identified as 185+ | <185) * P(<185)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability:
P(185+ | Witness Identified as 185+) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
