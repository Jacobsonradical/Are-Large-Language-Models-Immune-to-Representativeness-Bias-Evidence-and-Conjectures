To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights in similar situations.

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. We are also given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, so P(not A) = 0.85.

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's error rate, which is 20%, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
