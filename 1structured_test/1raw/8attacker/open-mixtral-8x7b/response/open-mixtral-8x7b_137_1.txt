To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Tall | Witness = Tall) = P(Witness = Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness = Tall)

We know that P(Witness = Tall | Tall) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(Witness = Tall) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as:

P(Witness = Tall) = P(Witness = Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness = Tall | Short) * P(Short)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now we can calculate P(Tall | Witness = Tall):

P(Tall | Witness = Tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.293

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.293.
