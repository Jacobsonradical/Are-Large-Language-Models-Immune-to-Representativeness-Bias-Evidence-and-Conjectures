Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities, both when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and when they are not.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
