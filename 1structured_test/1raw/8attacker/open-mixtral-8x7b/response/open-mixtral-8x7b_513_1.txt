To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. 

First, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not that tall).

We are also given that the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (P(A)), and since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (P(not A)).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can use the formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plug in the numbers:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4286 or 42.86%.
