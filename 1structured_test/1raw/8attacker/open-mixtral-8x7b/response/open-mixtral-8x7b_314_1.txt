Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not:

P(correct identification) = 0.80
P(error in identification) = 0.20

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that 50% of potential attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can now calculate the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller and is correctly identified as such by the witness:

P(185 cm or taller and correct ID) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(correct identification)
= 0.50 * 0.80
= 0.40

Similarly, we can calculate the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is not 185 cm or taller but is mistakenly identified as such by the witness:

P(not 185 cm or taller but incorrect ID) = P(not 185 cm or taller) * P(error in identification)
= 0.50 * 0.20
= 0.10

Now, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, by applying the formula for conditional probability:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = P(185 cm or taller and correct ID) / P(either correct ID or error resulting in identification of 185 cm or taller)
= P(185 cm or taller and correct ID) / [P(185 cm or taller and correct ID) + P(not 185 cm or taller but incorrect ID)]
= 0.40 / (0.40 + 0.10)
= 0.80

{probability: 0.80}
