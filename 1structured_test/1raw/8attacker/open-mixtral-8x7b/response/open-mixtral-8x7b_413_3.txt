To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the reliability of the witness and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

From statement a, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Then, we have:

P(T) = 0.15 (from statement b)

However, since the witness reported that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we should also account for the reliability of the witness. Let's denote P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and P(W|F) as the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller.

From statement a, P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|F) = 0.2.

Now, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(T|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|F) * P(F)]

We already have P(W|T) = 0.8, P(T) = 0.15, and from statement b, P(F) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have P(W) = 1.

P(W|F) = 1 - P(W|T) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
