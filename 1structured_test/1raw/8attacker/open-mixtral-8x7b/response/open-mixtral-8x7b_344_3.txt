Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This shows that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm. We can do this by taking into account both the population distribution and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's assume that the probability of the attacker being at/above 185 cm, given the witness's statement, is P(A|W).

We want to find P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

- P(W|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as at/above 185 cm given that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being at/above 185 cm, which is 0.5 (50% since the population is roughly equal).
- P(W) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as at/above 185 cm, which is calculated as follows:
  - P(W) = P(W|A)*P(A) + P(W|~A)*P(~A)
  - P(W|~A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as at/above 185 cm given that the attacker is not at/above 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).
  - P(~A) is the probability of the attacker not being at/above 185 cm, which is 0.5 (50%).
  - P(W) = (0.8*0.5) + (0.2*0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, or 66.67%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.6667}
