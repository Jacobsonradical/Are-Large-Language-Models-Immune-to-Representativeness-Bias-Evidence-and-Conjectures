To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis after considering new evidence.

Let H be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(~E|H) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our prior probability P(H) = 0.15.

We also need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, P(E|~H). Since 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller and the witness errs 20% of the time, P(E|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the evidence, P(H|E). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.184

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.184.
