To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.

Let's denote this probability as P(Taller | Witness identifies Taller).

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probability we're interested in: P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Taller).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(Taller | Witness identifies Taller) = P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Taller) \* P(Attacker is Taller) / P(Witness identifies Taller)

We want to find P(Attacker is Taller), so we can rearrange the formula to solve for it:

P(Attacker is Taller) = P(Taller | Witness identifies Taller) \* P(Witness identifies Taller) / P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Taller)

From the problem statement, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(Attacker is Taller) = 0.15.

We also know that P(Taller | Witness identifies Taller) = 0.8.

To find P(Witness identifies Taller), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness identifies Taller) = P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Taller) \* P(Attacker is Taller) + P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Shorter) \* P(Attacker is Shorter)

From the problem statement, we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so P(Attacker is Shorter) = 0.85.

We also know that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, so P(Witness identifies Taller | Attacker is Shorter) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(Witness identifies Taller), we get:

P(Witness identifies Taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can substitute all the values we've found into Bayes' theorem to find P(Attacker is Taller):

P(Attacker is Taller) = 0.8 \* 0.29 / (0.29 \* 0.8 + 0.71 \* 0.2) = 0.232 / (0.29 + 0.142) = 0.232 / 0.432 â‰ˆ 0.537

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.537}
