Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under these conditions is assessed at 80% accurate (with a 20% error rate).

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.8}

This estimate is based on the accuracy of the witness in identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
