To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Given this information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (from statement "a")
- P(A) = 0.15 (from statement "b")
- P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

To calculate P(W), we need to find P(W|not A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually under 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time (from statement "a"), P(W|not A) = 0.2.

We also need to find P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now, we can compute P(W):
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
