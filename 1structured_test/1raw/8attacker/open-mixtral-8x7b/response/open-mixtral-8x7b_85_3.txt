Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness statement) = 0.80

However, we also need to consider the base rates of attackers being 185 cm or taller, as mentioned in part (b). Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness statement) * P(witness statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller)) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness statement)

We are given that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (base rate), and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness statement) = 0.80 (witness accuracy). We need to find P(witness statement), which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness statement for both cases:

P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness statement | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. To find P(witness statement | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) and P(witness statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller), we need to calculate the probabilities for both scenarios:

Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- Probability of witness statement (correct) = 0.80

Scenario 2: Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller
- Probability of witness statement (incorrect) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(witness statement):

P(witness statement) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
