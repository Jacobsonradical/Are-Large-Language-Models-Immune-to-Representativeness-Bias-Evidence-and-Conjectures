Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%. This means the witness is more likely to correctly identify a tall person as tall but also more likely to mistakenly identify a short person as tall.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a tall attacker as tall)
P(A) = 0.15 (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker as tall, and the witness mistakenly identifies a short attacker as tall.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4737 (or 47.37% when expressed as a percentage)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4737}
