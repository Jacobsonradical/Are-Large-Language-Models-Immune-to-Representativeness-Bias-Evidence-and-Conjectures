To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person was indeed 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification of the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (which we know is 0.8 from statement "a")
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (which we know is 0.15 from statement "b")
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which we need to calculate)

We can calculate P(B) as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller, weighted by the probabilities of each of those possibilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From statement "a", we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.
- P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which we know is 0.85 from statement "b".

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
