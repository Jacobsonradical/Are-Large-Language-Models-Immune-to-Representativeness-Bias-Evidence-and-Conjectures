To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
A - event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
C - event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
D - event that the attacker is under 185 cm

From statement "a", we have the following probabilities:
- P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller with 80% probability)
- P(D|B) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is under 185 cm with 20% probability)

From statement "b", we have the following probabilities:
- P(C) + P(D) = 1 (since there are only two categories of height: under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D) (the law of total probability)
- P(B|D) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the witness will identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller in 15% of the cases when the attacker is under 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(C|B):
P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)
P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D)
P(B) = (0.8 * P(C)) + (0.15 * (1 - P(C)))

Now, we need to solve for P(C|B):
P(C|B) = (0.8 * P(C)) / ((0.8 * P(C)) + (0.15 * (1 - P(C))))

Given that P(C) + P(D) = 1, we know that P(D) = 1 - P(C). Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we have:
0.85 = P(D) = 1 - P(C)
So, P(C) = 0.15.

Now, substitute P(C) back into the equation for P(C|B):
P(C|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * (1 - 0.15)))
P(C|B) â‰ˆ 0.3333

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.3333}
