Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% likelihood). 

The witness in this case identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is a positive identification but not a guarantee due to the possibility of error. The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height, but errs in 20% of cases.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information. 

The formula for conditional probability would be useful here: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

We're given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller).

Since the population is roughly equally split, we can estimate P(A) and P(not A) as 0.5.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, given the information provided, there's an 80% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
