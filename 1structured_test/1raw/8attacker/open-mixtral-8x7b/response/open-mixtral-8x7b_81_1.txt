Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, despite the general population having roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, taller people are more likely to be attackers.

Now, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the witness being correct 80% of the time when the sample of people has half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller.

Given these pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the sample has equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there would be a higher likelihood that the witness is correct, considering that taller people are more likely to be attackers.

Since the witness is correct 80% of the time in the given scenario, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
