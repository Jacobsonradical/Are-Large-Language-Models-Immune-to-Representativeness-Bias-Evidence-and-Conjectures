Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This means that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, but there are still more tall people in the population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be written as:

P(Tall | Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness Report)

We are given:
P(Witness Report | Tall) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(Tall) = 0.5 (population is roughly 50-50)

To find P(Witness Report), we need to calculate the probability of the witness report given both height categories. Since there are twice as many short people in the population, we have:

P(Witness Report | Short) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (witness incorrectly identifies short people 20% of the time)
P(Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness Report | Short) * P(Short)
P(Witness Report) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.1 * 0.5) = 0.45 + 0.05 = 0.5

Now we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness report:

P(Tall | Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness Report)
P(Tall | Witness Report) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
P(Tall | Witness Report) = 0.4

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4}
