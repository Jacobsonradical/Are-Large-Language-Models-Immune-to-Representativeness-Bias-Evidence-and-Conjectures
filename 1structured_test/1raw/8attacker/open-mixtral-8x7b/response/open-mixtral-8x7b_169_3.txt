Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185cm or taller correcting, which we'll call P(Correct|185cm+). According to the statement, the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, so:

P(Correct|185cm+) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185cm or taller incorrectly, which we'll call P(Incorrect|<185cm). According to the statement, the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185cm or taller 20% of the time, so:

P(Incorrect|<185cm) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter than 185cm and those 185cm and taller are roughly equal in size, and 85% of such attackers are people under 185cm, the prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller, which we'll call P(185cm+), is:

P(185cm+) = 15% = 0.15

Similarly, the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm, which we'll call P(<185cm), is:

P(<185cm) = 85% = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, which we'll call P(185cm+|Correct):

P(185cm+|Correct) = P(Correct|185cm+) * P(185cm+) / [P(Correct|185cm+) * P(185cm+) + P(Incorrect|<185cm) * P(<185cm)]

Substituting the values we calculated above:

P(185cm+|Correct) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(185cm+|Correct) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.375.
