Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. They correctly identify height 80% of the time and err 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and H be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are interested in P(A|H), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

P(A|H) = P(H|A) * P(A) / P(H)

We are given P(H|A) from part b, which is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker 80% of the time).

P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the distribution of attacker heights in part a. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(H), we need to calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of identifying a tall attacker correctly and identifying a short attacker incorrectly as tall. The complementary probability of not identifying a tall attacker correctly is P(H'|A) = 1 - P(H|A) = 0.2. For short attackers, P(H|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall, which is 0.2 (from part b). Since there are equal numbers of short and tall people in the population, we have P(not A) = 0.5. We can now calculate P(H):

P(H) = P(H|A) * P(A) + P(H|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22

Now we can compute the posterior probability P(A|H):

P(A|H) = P(H|A) * P(A) / P(H) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.545}
