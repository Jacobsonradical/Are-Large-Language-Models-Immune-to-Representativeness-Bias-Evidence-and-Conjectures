Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and mistakenly:

P(correct identification) = 0.80
P(incorrect identification) = 0.20

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, this information doesn't help us much in estimating the attacker's height. However, we do know that the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases.

Given this, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as the probability of correct identification by the witness:

{probability: 0.8}
