Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that short people may be more likely to become attackers than tall people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A represents "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B represents "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall attackers 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between tall and short people)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies tall people as attackers 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
= 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
