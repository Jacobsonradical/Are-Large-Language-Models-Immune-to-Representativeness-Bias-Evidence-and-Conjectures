Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(incorrect ID) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Let's denote the height of the attacker as H, where H = 1 if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and H = 0 if the attacker is under 185 cm.

We want to find P(H=1|witness reports H=1), which is the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness reported so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(H=1|witness reports H=1) = [P(witness reports H=1|H=1) * P(H=1)] / P(witness reports H=1)

The term P(H=1) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% (from point a).

The term P(witness reports H=1) can be calculated as the sum of two cases: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker is not but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such:

P(witness reports H=1) = P(witness reports H=1|H=1) * P(H=1) + P(witness reports H=1|H=0) * P(H=0)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(witness reports H=1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

P(H=1|witness reports H=1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's report is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
