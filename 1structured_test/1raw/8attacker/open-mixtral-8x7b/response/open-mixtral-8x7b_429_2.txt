To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar circumstances. We can combine these two pieces of information to make a probabilistic estimate.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 15% (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Next, we'll calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% probability)

Now, we need to calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller. In other words:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Lastly, we need to calculate P(¬B|¬A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. In this case, the witness errs in their judgment 20% of the time.

P(¬B|¬A) = 0.2 (20% probability)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
       = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
       = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
