To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define two events:
- W: The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.
- T: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

From the problem statement, we know that P(W|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), and P(T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness. When the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness identifies them correctly with probability P(W|T) = 0.8. When the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller with probability P(W|¬T) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time). Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than 185 cm, we can estimate P(¬T) as 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|¬T) * P(¬T) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.14 (14% chance that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

Finally, we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.14) ≈ 0.8571 or 85.71%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8571}
