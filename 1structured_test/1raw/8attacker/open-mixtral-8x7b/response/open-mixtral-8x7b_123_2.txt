Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This implies that even though the general population has an equal split, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when presented with a person of that height, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and was correct 80% of the time in such cases, we can estimate that the attacker was 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
