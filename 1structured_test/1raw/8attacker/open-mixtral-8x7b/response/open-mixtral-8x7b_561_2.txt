To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says that a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken. Let's denote this as P(Correct) = 0.8 and P(Mistaken) = 0.2.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are people 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this as P(Under 185 cm) = 0.85 and P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identified) = P(Witness Identified | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(Witness Identified)

We can calculate the terms on the right-hand side as follows:

* P(Witness Identified | 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct) = 0.8
* P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15
* P(Witness Identified) = P(Witness Identified | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(Witness Identified | Under 185 cm) \* P(Under 185 cm)

Since the witness is always correct when they say a person is under 185 cm, P(Witness Identified | Under 185 cm) = 1. Therefore,

P(Witness Identified) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 1 \* 0.85 = 0.93

Substituting these values back into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness Identified) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.93 = 0.129

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.129.
