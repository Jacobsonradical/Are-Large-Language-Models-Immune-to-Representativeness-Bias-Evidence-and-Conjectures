Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers relative to their proportion in the population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for such individuals.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can express this as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness identified as 185 cm) = (P(Witness identifies correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm)) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm)

We are given:
- P(Witness identifies correctly) = 0.8
- P(Attacker is 185 cm) = 0.15 (from point a)
- P(Witness identifies as 185 cm) = P(Witness identifies correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies incorrectly) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm)

Since the population is roughly equally split between those below and above 185 cm, we can assume:
- P(Attacker is not 185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
- P(Witness identifies as 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness identified as 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
