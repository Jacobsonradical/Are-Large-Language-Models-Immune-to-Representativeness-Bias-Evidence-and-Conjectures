Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population: there is roughly an equal number of people who are shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, despite the population being evenly split, shorter individuals are more likely to be attackers.

Next, we have the witness's statement, which has an 80% success rate in identifying the height correctly and a 20% error rate.

Given these pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

First, calculate the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (population proportion of people 185 cm or taller) = 0.12

Second, calculate the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
0.2 (witness error rate) * 0.85 (population proportion of people under 185 cm) = 0.17

Now, add these two probabilities together to get the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.29 (29%).
