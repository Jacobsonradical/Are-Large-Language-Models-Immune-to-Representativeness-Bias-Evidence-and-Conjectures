Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. Let's denote this probability as P(W|T), where W is the event of correct identification by the witness and T is the event that the person is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 20%. Let's denote this probability as P(W|S), where S is the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, we can denote the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller as P(T) = 0.5 and the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm as P(S) = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, by using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(T|W) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(T|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(T|W) = 0.8 / 1
P(T|W) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is 0.8.
