To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm
- P(E): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly
- P(E'): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker incorrectly

From statement a, we know that:
P(E) = 0.8 and P(E') = 0.2

From statement b, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85 (where A' represents the attackers' height being shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to compute it:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

First, we need to find:
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(B|A') = probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From statement a, we know that when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness identifies it correctly 80% of the time, so:
P(B|A) = 0.8

When the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, the witness identifies it as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so:
P(B|A') = 0.2

Now we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 28.57%.

Please answer the question strictly in the following format:
{probability: 0.2857}
