To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so we can assume that P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm). We are also given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so we can assume that P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
