Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(~A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8)
- P(W|~A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (20% or 0.2)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

From the information provided:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|~A) = 0.2
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating the above expression:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36 or 36%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.36}.
