Given the information, let's reason through this:

The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that even though the populations are equal, taller people are more likely to be attackers.

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the sample consists of equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm.

So, even though the populations are equal, there's a higher probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller because the witness identified the attacker as such, and the witness is correct 80% of the time in these circumstances.

The final calculation is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correctly identified tall attacker) * P(Tall attacker)
= 0.8 * 0.5
= 0.4

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's error rate is the same for all heights. If the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify someone as taller than they are rather than shorter, then the probability would be higher. Without further information, though, we'll stick with the given data.

{probability: 0.4}
