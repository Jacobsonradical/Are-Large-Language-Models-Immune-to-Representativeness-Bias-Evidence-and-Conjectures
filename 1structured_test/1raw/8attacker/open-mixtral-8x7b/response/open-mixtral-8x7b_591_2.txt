To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

First, we'll compute the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller, which is the witness's accuracy rate for that category:

P(correctly identified tall person) = 0.8

Next, we'll compute the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the attacker population:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified tall person)
= P(witness identified tall person | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified tall person)

The denominator, P(witness identified tall person), can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker and incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall:

P(witness identified tall person)
= P(witness identified tall person and attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified tall person and attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= P(witness identified tall person | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified tall person | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we have all the necessary components to compute Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified tall person)
= P(correctly identified tall person) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / (
P(correctly identified tall person) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(incorrectly identified short person as tall) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
)

Substituting the values we've calculated:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified tall person)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (
0.8 * 0.15
+ 0.2 * 0.85
)

Calculating the final probability:

probability: 0.36 (36%)
