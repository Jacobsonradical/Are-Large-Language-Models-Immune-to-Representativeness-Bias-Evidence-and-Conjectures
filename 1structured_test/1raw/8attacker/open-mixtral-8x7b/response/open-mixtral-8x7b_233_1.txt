To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b". 

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can use this information to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- T: The event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- S: The event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(T|S), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / P(S)

First, calculate P(S|T):
- The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(S|T) = 0.8.

Next, calculate P(T):
- Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(T) = 0.15.

Now, calculate P(S):
- P(S) = P(S and T) + P(S and not T)
- P(S and T) = P(S|T) * P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- For P(S and not T), consider that the witness will incorrectly identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is actually under 185 cm. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, the probability of this occurring is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
- Thus, P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, calculate P(T|S):
- P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / P(S) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
