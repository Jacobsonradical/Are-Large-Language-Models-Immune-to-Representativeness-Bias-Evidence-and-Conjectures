Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of them are by people under 185 cm. This suggests that, compared to the general population, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

Given this, the fact that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is somewhat surprising, because people of that height are less common among attackers. This suggests that the witness might have erred.

The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time. Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller can be estimated as the proportion of times the witness is correct:

0.8 (the probability that the witness is correct)

Please note that this is an estimate based on the information provided and the reasoning applied. The actual probability could be different, depending on various factors not specified in the information.
