To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let P(A) represent the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Since we want to find P(A), and we are given P(B|A), P(A), and P(B|A) = 0.8, we can express P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can express P(not A) as 0.85, and P(B|not A) as 0.2 (the witness's error rate for heights under 185 cm).

Now, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.17

Using Bayes' theorem again, we can find P(A):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
0.8 = (0.8 * P(A)) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.17)

Now, let's solve for P(A):

0.8 * P(A) + 0.136 = 0.8
0.8 * P(A) = 0.664
P(A) = 0.664 / 0.8 = 0.83

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.83}
