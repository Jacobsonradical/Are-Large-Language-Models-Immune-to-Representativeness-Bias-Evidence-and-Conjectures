To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probabilities of attackers being in each height category.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller:

P(Correct ID | 185+) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller:

P(Incorrect ID | <185) = 0.2

Now, we need to find the prior probabilities of attackers being in each height category. From the information provided, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:

P(<185) = 0.85
P(185+) = 0.15

Now we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(185+ | Correct ID) = P(Correct ID | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Correct ID)
                                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
                                 = 0.12

P(185+ | Incorrect ID) = P(Incorrect ID | <185) * P(<185) / P(Incorrect ID)
                                 = (0.2 * 0.85) / ((0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15))
                                 = 0.2222

To find the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probabilities of both correct identification and incorrect identification:

P(185+) = P(185+ | Correct ID) * P(Correct ID) + P(185+ | Incorrect ID) * P(Incorrect ID)
              = (0.12 * 0.8) + (0.2222 * 0.2)
              = 0.1578 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1578}
