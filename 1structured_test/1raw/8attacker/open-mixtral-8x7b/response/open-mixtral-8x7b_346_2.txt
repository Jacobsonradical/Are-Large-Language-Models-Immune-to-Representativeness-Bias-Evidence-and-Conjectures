Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into parts:

a. The population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, but 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we need to consider both the accuracy of the witness and the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability we want to calculate as P(Tall | Witness report), where Tall represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and Witness report denotes the statement from the witness.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(Tall | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness report)

We are given P(Witness report | Tall) = 0.8 (the accuracy of the witness identifying a tall attacker as tall) and P(Tall) = 0.5 (the prior probability of a person being tall).

Now, we need to calculate P(Witness report). This can be calculated as a weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness report given the attacker's height:

P(Witness report) = P(Witness report | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness report | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)

Given the witness's error rate of 20%, we have P(Witness report | Not Tall) = 0.2. Since the population is roughly equally split, we have P(Not Tall) = 0.5 as well.

So, P(Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Tall | Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.67 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 or 67%.
