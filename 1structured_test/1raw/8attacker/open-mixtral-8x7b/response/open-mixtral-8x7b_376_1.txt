Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identified someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification.

b) 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of the attacker being under 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).

Let P(A) be the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and P(~B) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as under 185 cm. We are looking for P(A), and have information about P(B|A) (0.8), P(~B|A) (0.2), and P(B|~A) (0.85).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), and P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A).

Using this, we can calculate P(A) = P(B) * P(B|A) / P(B|A) = P(A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A) / P(B|A)

P(A) = (0.85 * 0.8) / (0.85 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.85) = 0.5769 (57.69%).

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5769 (57.69%).
