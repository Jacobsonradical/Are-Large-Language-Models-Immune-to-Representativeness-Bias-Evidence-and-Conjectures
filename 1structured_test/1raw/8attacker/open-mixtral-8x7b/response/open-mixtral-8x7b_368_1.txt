Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The probability of them making an error is given as 20% or 0.2.

Now, even though the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, the attackers are not evenly divided in this way: 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker actually was this tall. This is a case of applying Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be written as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the accuracy of the witness).
We know P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both the true positives (the witness correctly identifies attackers who are 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (the witness mistakenly identifies attackers who are not 185 cm or taller as being so):

P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.345 (or 34.5%).
