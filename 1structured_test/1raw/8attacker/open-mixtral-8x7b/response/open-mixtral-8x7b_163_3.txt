Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% likelihood), which means that taller individuals may be a minority in the attacker population.

Next, we have the testimony of a witness who is correct 80% of the time when estimating height and wrong 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. First, consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the general population. Since it's roughly equal, this would be about 50%.
2. However, since attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, we need to adjust for this. This is known as base rate neglect, where we fail to account for the initial probabilities of a given event.
3. To correct for this, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
4. Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. We need to calculate P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
6. Given that the witness is right 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, we get: P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6
7. Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.667, or approximately 67%

Therefore, based on the given information, there's a roughly 67% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
