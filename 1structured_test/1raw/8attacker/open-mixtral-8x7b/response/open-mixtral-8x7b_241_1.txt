Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume a 50-50 chance of an attacker being taller or shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.5. To calculate P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to account for both cases of correct and incorrect identification:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.667 (66.7%).
