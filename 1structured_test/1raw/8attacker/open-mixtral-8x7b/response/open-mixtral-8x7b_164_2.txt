Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, when it comes to attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, despite the general population being evenly divided, taller individuals are overrepresented among attackers.

Next, we have the testimony of a witness who has been assessed as having an 80% success rate in judging a person's height and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is a successful identification 80% of the time. Therefore, even without knowing the exact height of the attacker, we can estimate that there is an 80% probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's track record.

However, we must also consider the possibility of error, which occurs 20% of the time. This means that, despite the witness's identification, there is still a 20% chance that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

Taking both of these probabilities into account, we can calculate a final estimate using Bayes' theorem. However, due to the limitations of the information provided, a precise calculation would require assigning arbitrary values to unknown quantities, which could lead to inaccurate results. Therefore, based on the given information, we can only provide a rough estimate.

Given the witness's 80% success rate and 20% error rate, as well as the overrepresentation of taller individuals among attackers, it is reasonable to estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is higher than 50%, but likely lower than 80%. A more precise answer would require additional information.
