Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that taller people are overrepresented as attackers.

b. The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Let's define our variables:
- Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally divided)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in identifying the height 20% of the time)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
