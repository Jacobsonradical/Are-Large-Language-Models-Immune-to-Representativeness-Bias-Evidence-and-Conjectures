Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually under 185 cm, the witness will still say he is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. 

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm, and that the attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% chance), there's a higher probability that the witness's statement is an error.

However, without knowing the exact number of attackers, we can't provide an exact probability. We can only say that, given the witness's general accuracy rate of 80%, there's a 4 in 5 (or 0.8) chance that the witness is correct, and a 1 in 5 (or 0.2) chance that the witness is wrong and the attacker is actually under 185 cm.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's statement, is 0.8. This is our estimate, but keep in mind it does not take into account the specific details about the population of attackers.
