First, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can do this by applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 80% (witness is correct when identifying tall attackers)
P(B|not A) = 20% (witness makes an error when identifying shorter attackers as tall)
P(A) = 15% (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 85% (proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 (or 29%)

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41 (or 41%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
