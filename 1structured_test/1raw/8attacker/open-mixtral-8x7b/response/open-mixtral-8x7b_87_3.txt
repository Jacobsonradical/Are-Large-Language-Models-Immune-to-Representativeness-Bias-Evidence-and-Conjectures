To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, this means that the base rate for people who are 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:

* P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
* P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.
* P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

where:

* P(B and A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is P(B|A) * P(A).
* P(B and not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, but the attacker's height is actually not 185 cm or taller. This is P(B|not A) * P(not A).
* P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A).

From the information given, we know that P(B|not A) is 0.2, since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller.

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(not A) is 0.85.

Therefore, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * P(A) / (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85)

Since we want to find P(A), we can solve for it by rearranging the equation:

P(A) = P(A|B) * (0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8

From the information given, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so we can use this as our initial estimate for P(A):

P(A) = 0.15

Plugging this value into the equation, we get:

P(A) = 0.15 * (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.8
P(A) ≈ 0.15 * 0.2475 / 0.8
P(A) ≈ 0.045

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.045}
