Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%). This means that even though the general population is half and half, the subset of attackers is not - they are more likely to be short.

Now, we have a witness who is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. But this also means they are wrong 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's use Bayes' theorem again:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly evenly split, and attackers are more likely to be short, the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is less than 0.5)
- P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We don't have exact values for P(B|not A) or P(not A), but we can estimate them based on the given information. We know that attackers are more likely to be short, so P(not A) is probably greater than 0.5. And since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) is 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

So, we can estimate:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * P(not A)) = 0.4 + 0.2 * P(not A)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.4 + 0.2 * P(not A))

However, without a specific value for P(not A), we can't provide an exact numerical answer. But based on the information given, we can say that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is likely less than 0.5, since attackers are more likely to be short.

So, I would answer the question strictly in the following format:
{probability: my estimate is less than 0.5, but I can't provide an exact number without more information}
