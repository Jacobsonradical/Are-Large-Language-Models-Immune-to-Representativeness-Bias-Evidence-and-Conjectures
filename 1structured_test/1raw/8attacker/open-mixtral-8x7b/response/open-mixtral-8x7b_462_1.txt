Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. There is an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, with 85% of them being of that height and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now, we have a witness who has a 80% success rate in correctly identifying a person's height and a 20% error rate.

Given these facts, even though the general population is split equally in height, the attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. However, the witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, it's more likely that this assessment is accurate.

We need to weigh the prior probability (the distribution of heights in the general population) with the likelihood of the witness being correct. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(¬B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as such
- P(¬A|B) as the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as such

From the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct 80% of the time)
P(¬B|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrect 20% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0 (witness should never identify someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the person as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Since P(B|¬A) = 0, this simplifies to:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A)

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
