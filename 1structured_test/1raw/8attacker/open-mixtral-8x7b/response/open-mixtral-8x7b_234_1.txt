Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not:

This is given as 20%, or 0.2.

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to estimate the probability that this identification is correct. 

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm, and that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we might initially estimate the probability as 0.5 (since half the population is 185 cm or taller) times 0.8 (the accuracy of the witness), or 0.4.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error. If the witness erred, they would have identified someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not. Given the error rate of 0.2, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is actually under 185 cm.

To account for both possibilities, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness error) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
