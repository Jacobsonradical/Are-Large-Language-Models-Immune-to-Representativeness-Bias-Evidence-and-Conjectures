To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both "a" and "b".

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of cases. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller. To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability (the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) based on the new information (the witness's identification).

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

We are also given that P(A) is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given that P(B|A) is 0.8 and P(A) is 0.15. We also know that P(not A) is 0.85 (since the population of people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

To find P(B|not A), we can use the complementary probability: P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A). We know that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, so P(not B|not A) is 0.2, and P(B|not A) is 0.8.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.8)*(0.85) = 0.24 + 0.68 = 0.92

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.92) = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (or 12%).
