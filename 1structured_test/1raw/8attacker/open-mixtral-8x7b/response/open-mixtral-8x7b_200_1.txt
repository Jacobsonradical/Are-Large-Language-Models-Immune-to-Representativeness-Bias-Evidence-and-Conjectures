Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness will identify the attacker correctly. However, this also means that if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there is still a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know from (a) that P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
We need to find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller). To find this probability, we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * 0.85]

We don't know the exact value for P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller), but since the witness errs 20% of the time, we can estimate this probability as 0.2.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
