Let's first define our prior probability (before considering the new information) and our likelihood (the probability of the observations given the height categories).

The prior probability is the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. According to information "b", this is 15%. So, P(taller) = 0.15 and P(shorter) = 0.85.

The likelihood of the observation (the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 when the attacker is actually taller and 0.2 when the attacker is actually shorter (information "a"). So, L(taller) = 0.8 and L(shorter) = 0.2.

We can now calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the observation. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(taller | observation) = P(observation | taller) * P(taller) / P(observation)

The denominator, P(observation), is the sum of the numerator for both height categories, so P(observation) = L(taller) * P(taller) + L(shorter) * P(shorter).

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(taller | observation) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.3636

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the new information, is approximately 0.3636 (36.36%).
