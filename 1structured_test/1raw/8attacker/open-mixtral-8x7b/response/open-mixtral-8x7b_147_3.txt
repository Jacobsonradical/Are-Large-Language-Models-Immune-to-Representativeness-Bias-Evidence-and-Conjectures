To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85%.
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.28125

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.28125 (28.125%).
