To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population distribution and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): Probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A): Probability of correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|not A): Probability of incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they are not actually 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correct identification rate). Also, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B'|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness error rate).

Now, we need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.18
= 0.3

Finally, to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3
= 0.12 / 0.3
= 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.
