To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the following events:
- W: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- A: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- E: The event that the witness is correct in identifying the attacker's height.

From the given information, we know that P(E|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). We want to find P(A|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

Since P(W|A) = P(E|A) = 0.8, we can calculate P(W|A'):

P(W|A') = 1 - P(W'|A') = 1 - P(E'|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.8)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.8) = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
