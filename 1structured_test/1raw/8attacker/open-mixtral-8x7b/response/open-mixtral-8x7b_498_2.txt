Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height was assessed. They are correct 80% of the time and err 20% when the population is evenly divided between those below and above 185 cm.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and their ability to judge height is 80% accurate, we can estimate the probability as follows:

{probability: 0.8}

This estimate is based on the accuracy of the witness and the information they provided about the attacker's height.
