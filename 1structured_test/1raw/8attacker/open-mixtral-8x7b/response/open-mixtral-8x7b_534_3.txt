To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the general population and the witness's ability to judge height.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller;
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller);
- P(A) = 0.5 (given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller);
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness erroneously identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not that tall).

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
     = 0.6

Finally, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
       = 0.6667

{probability: 0.6667}
