To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the attacker's height 80% of the time)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases)

P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
