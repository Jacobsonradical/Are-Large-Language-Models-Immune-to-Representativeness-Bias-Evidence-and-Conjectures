Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This implies that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.8 as well.

b) 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. However, the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size.

Now, let's calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller)

We can simplify P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) as:
P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * 0.5 + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * 0.5

Given that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, and P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (complementary probability), we can calculate:

P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(185 cm or taller):

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

From the given information, we know that the proportion of attackers that are 185 cm or taller is 15%, so:

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

The answer is: {probability: 0.12}
