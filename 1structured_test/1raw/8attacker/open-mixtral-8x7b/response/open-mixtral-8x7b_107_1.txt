Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate. This means there's a 20% chance they could be mistaken about the attacker's height.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can start with an 80% probability, or 0.8. However, since the attackers are more likely to be shorter, we also need to account for the fact that the witness might be mistaken.

We can express the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.29 (witness error when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.29 * 0.85)] = 0.252

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.252 (25.2%).
