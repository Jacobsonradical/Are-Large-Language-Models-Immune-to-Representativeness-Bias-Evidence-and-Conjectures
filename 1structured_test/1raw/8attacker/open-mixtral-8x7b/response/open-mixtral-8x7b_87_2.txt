To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such:
P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification:
P(185+) = 0.15 (from part b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness identifies 185+)

We know P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) = 0.8, P(185+) = 0.15
We can find P(Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) + P(Witness identifies 185+ | <185>) * P(<185>)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

So, P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.324

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.324.
