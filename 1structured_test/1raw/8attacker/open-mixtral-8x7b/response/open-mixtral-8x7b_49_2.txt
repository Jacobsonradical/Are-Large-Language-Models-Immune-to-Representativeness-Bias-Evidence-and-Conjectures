Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being actually shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In our case:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Format answer: {probability: 0.4138}
