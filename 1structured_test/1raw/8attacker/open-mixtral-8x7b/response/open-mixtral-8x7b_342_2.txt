To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, or 80%.

Symbolically, we can write this as:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

From statement b, we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, or 15%.

Symbolically, we can write this as:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have already found the values for P(A) and P(B | A). To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the false positive rate (when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness identifies them as such) and the true positive rate (when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness identifies them as such).

The false positive rate is given by:
P(B | not A) = 1 - P(not B | not A) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

where not A is the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, and not B is the event that the witness does not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Since we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, the true positive rate is given by:
P(B | A) = 0.8

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) + P(B | not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.15 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1275
= 0.2475

Now, we can calculate P(A | B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.2475
= 0.096

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
