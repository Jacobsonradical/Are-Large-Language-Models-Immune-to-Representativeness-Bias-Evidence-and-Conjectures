Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. We know that the population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, which means that even though the populations are equal, taller attackers are more common. This is called base rate fallacy and can lead to incorrect conclusions if not taken into account.

2. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to find the probability of an event (hypothesis) given some evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness identifying the attacker as such.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's denote:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Now, let's calculate each term:

P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the base rate. Since the population is roughly equally divided, P(A) = 0.5

P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the accuracy of the witness, which is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8

P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to consider both cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and the witness is correct (B|A), as well as the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (¬A) and the witness is incorrect (B|¬A).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We don't have the exact numbers for P(B|¬A) and P(¬A), but we do know that the witness is incorrect 20% of the time. Since the population is equally divided, we can assume that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller 50% of the time, so P(¬A) = 0.5. Thus, the probability of the witness being incorrect is P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (67%).
