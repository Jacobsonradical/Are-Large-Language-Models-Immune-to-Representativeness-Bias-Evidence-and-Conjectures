Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker correctly and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so the probability of them doing so with the attacker is also 0.8 (or 80%).

However, they mistakenly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Since half of the general population is shorter than 185 cm, this means the probability of them mistakenly identifying someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (or 10%).

Given that the attacker is either under or over 185 cm, and given the witness's statements, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm | Witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.1. Also, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 1 and P(Attacker is under 185 cm | Witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 1.

Substituting these values into our formula, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.1 * 1 = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9 (or 90%).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9}
