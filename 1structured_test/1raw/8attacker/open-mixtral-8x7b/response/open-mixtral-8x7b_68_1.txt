To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given data, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2143

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2143 (21.43%).
