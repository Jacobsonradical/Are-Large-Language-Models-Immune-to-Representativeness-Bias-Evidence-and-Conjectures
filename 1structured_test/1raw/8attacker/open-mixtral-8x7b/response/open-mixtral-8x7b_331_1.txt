To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the case where the attacker is not (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). Let C be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|C) * P(C).

We are given:
P(B|C) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the height 20% of the time)
P(C) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|C) * P(C) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
