Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of them making an error:

P(correctly identified | 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
P(error | not 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume a 50/50 chance of the attacker being 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm. 

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to calculate P(identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | not 185 cm or taller) * P(not 185 cm or taller)

P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50) = 0.60

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60 â‰ˆ 0.6667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (67%).
