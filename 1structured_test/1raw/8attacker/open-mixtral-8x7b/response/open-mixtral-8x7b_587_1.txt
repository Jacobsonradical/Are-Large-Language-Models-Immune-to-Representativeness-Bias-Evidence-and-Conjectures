Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate when judging height under similar conditions.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's statistics. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that they accurately identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

{probability: 0.8}
