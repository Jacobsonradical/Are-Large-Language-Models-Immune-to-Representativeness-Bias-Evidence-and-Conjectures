To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis based on evidence.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the observed evidence. We have two pieces of evidence, so we will calculate P(B) as the sum of probabilities for each piece of evidence.

From statement a, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people below and above 185 cm, the probability of choosing a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.5. Therefore:

P(B|A) = probability of observing the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies) + 0.2 * 0.5 (witness errs but picks a person who is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9

From statement b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

Now let's calculate P(B), the probability of the evidence. From statement b, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. Therefore:

P(B) = probability of observing the evidence = 0.85 * 0.9 (witness correctly identifies when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller) + 0.15 * 0.1 (witness errs when the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.765 + 0.015 = 0.78

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.9 * 0.15) / 0.78 â‰ˆ 0.1795

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1795 or 17.95%.
