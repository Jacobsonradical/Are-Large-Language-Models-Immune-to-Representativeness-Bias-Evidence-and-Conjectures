Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions was assessed. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller based on the witness's accuracy.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (event A) or the witness erred in their judgment (event ~A).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). For P(B|~A), the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not; this happens 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2. For P(~A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, it is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
