Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, contrary to the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can represent this probability as P(T | W), where T represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and W represents the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(T | W) = [P(W | T) * P(T)] / P(W)

We know:
P(W | T) = 80% or 0.8 (probability of witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller as such)
P(T) = 15% or 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(W), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W) = P(W | T) * P(T) + P(W | ~T) * P(~T)

We already have P(W | T) = 0.8, and P(T) = 0.15.
For P(W | ~T), the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(W | ~T) = 0.2.
Since ~T represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and the population is roughly evenly split, we can assume P(~T) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(T | W):
P(T | W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41
