Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under these conditions is 80% accurate with a 20% error rate.

Given these facts, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when they identify someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
