To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

First, we know that P(W|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80% or 0.8 in statement "a".

Next, we know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15 in statement "b".

To find P(W), we need to consider the two possible cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

For the first case, P(W|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

For the second case, P(W|¬A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 20% or 0.2 in statement "a".

P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

So, P(W|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Since these are the only two possible cases, we can find P(W) by adding the probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

However, since we are interested in the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, not just the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we actually want P(A), which we already know is 0.15.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
