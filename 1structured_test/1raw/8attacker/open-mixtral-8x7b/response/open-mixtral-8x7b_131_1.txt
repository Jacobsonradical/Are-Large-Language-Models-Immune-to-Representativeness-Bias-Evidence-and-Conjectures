Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means there is an 80% chance that if the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, this is true, and a 20% chance that if the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, this is false.

b. Only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can estimate this probability as:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since the witness is always correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller if they truly are), and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%).

We need to find P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller):

P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= 1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 1 * 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
