To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs given new evidence.

First, let's define our terms:
- Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let D represent the observed evidence.

We are interested in P(H|D), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observed evidence.

From the question, we have two pieces of information:
1. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (when the true height is 185 cm or taller) and erroneously identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (when the true height is less than 185 cm).
2. Of the attackers, 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D), where:
- P(D|H) is the probability of observing the evidence D given that the height is H.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the height H.
- P(D) is the total probability of observing the evidence D.

Let's compute each term.

P(D|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.80 by the question.

P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to the population of people shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have P(H) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075.

P(D) is the total probability of observing the evidence D, which is the sum of P(D and H) (the probability of observing the evidence D and the height H) and P(D and not H) (the probability of observing the evidence D but the height is not H).

P(D and H) = P(D|H) * P(H) = 0.80 * 0.075 = 0.06

P(D and not H) = P(D|not H) * P(not H)

P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.925.

P(D|not H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.20 by the question.

So, P(D and not H) = 0.20 * 0.925 = 0.185

P(D) = P(D and H) + P(D and not H) = 0.06 + 0.185 = 0.245

Finally, we can compute P(H|D) = P(D|H) * P(H) / P(D) = 0.80 * 0.075 / 0.245 â‰ˆ 0.248.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.248.
