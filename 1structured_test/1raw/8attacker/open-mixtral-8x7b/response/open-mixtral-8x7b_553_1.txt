Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not:

This is given as 20% or 0.2.

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know P(B|A) from the second piece of information, which is 80% or 0.8.

From the first piece of information, we know that the population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = P(not A) = 0.5.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (not A). We know P(B|A) and P(B|not A) (which is the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not, or 0.2). We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.667.
