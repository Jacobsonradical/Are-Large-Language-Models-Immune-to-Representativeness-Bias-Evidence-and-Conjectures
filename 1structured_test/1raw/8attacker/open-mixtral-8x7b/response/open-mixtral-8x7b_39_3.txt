Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means there is an 80% chance that if the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller, they truly are. However, it also means there is a 20% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. Despite the populations being roughly equal, the rarer group (taller than 185 cm) is more likely to be involved in attacks.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.

P(A) is the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) requires the calculation of P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A), which is the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is either in the 185 cm or taller group or the under 185 cm group.

P(B|not A) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20.

P(not A) is the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being under 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
