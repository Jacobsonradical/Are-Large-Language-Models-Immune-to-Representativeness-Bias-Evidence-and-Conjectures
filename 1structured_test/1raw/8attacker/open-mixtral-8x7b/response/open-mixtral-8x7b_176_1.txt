Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal number of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, which is counter-intuitive and therefore interesting.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for such heights.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". 

From the witness's data, we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
P(~B|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as shorter)

And from the attacker population data, we know that:
P(A) = 0.5 (there's a roughly equal number of shorter and taller people)
P(~A) = 0.5

We also know that:
P(B|~A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(~B|~A) = 0.85

We want to find P(A|B), which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.15 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.075)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.875
P(A|B) = 0.9142857142857142

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is approximately 0.91 (or 91%).
