To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both statements "a" and "b". 

According to statement "a", the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erred 20% of the time. 

According to statement "b", only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. 

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Since the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller) x 0.15 (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 or 12%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
