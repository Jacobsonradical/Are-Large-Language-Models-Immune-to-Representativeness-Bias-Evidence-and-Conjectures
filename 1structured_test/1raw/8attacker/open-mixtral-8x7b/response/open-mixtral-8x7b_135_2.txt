Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

Since the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the witness's errors are also evenly distributed. That is, 10% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, and 10% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being under 185 cm.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of this being correct as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) is what we want to find.

We can calculate P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) as follows:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such 80% of the time)

We know that P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split)

We know that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 10% of the the time)

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * X) + (0.1 * 0.5) where X is the probability we are trying to find

Solving for X, we get:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8X + 0.05
0.2X = 0.05
X = 0.0625

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.0625 or 6.25%.
