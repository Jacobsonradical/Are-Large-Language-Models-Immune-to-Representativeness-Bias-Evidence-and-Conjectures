To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P'(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B'|A') = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the estimated probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
