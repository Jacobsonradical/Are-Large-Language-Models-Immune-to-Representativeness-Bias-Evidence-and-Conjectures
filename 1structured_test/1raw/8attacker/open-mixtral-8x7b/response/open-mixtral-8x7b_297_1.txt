To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We know:
- P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
- P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short)
- P(Witness | Short) = 1 - P(Witness | Tall) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(Short) = 1 - P(Tall) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(Witness) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
P(Tall | Witness) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
