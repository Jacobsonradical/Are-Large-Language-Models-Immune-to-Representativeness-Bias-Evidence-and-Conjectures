Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate (correct identification) and 20% inaccurate (erroneous identification).

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller or the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

To find P(B|not A), we need to consider the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is given as 20%, or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
