Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means that when the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are mistaken.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, even though the population is roughly equal in size for those shorter and taller than 185 cm. This means that even though there are as many people below and above 185 cm, attackers are more likely to be below 185 cm.

Given this information, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases, we can estimate the probability as:

0.8 * probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement

We also need to consider the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (15%). We can now calculate the posterior probability by applying Bayes' theorem:

posterior probability = (0.8 * prior probability) / (0.8 * prior probability + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - prior probability))

posterior probability = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

posterior probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

posterior probability = 0.12 / 0.29

posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
