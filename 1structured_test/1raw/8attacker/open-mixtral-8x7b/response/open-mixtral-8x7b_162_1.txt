Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and then the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller incorrectly.

P(Correct) = 80% = 0.8
P(Incorrect) = 20% = 0.2

From the description, the population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of randomly selecting someone who is 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

However, since the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we should use conditional probabilities to update our estimate based on the new evidence.

We want to calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), which can be written as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified correctly) / P(Total evidence)

Given that:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5
P(Witness identified correctly) = 0.8
P(Total evidence) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified correctly) + P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified incorrectly)

Now, we can calculate the total evidence:
P(Total evidence) = (0.5 * 0.8) + ((1 - 0.5) * 0.2) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate our final estimate:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.5 * 0.8) / 0.5 = 0.8

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
