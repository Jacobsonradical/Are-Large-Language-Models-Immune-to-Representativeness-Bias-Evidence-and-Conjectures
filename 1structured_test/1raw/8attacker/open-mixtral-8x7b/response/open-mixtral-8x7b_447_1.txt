To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

According to the information given, we know the following probabilities:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
