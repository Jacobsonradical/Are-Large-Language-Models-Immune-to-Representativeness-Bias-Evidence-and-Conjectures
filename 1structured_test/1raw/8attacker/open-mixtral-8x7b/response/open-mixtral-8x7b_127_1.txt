Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in the group of attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that being an attacker of a certain height is not evenly distributed in the population.

Next, we have the testimony of a witness who has been assessed as having an 80% success rate in determining height and a 20% error rate.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

1. We start with the prior probability, which is the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller, i.e., 15%.
2. Next, we apply the witness's accuracy to this base rate. The witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, would be: (base rate * witness's accuracy) + (1 - base rate * witness's error rate) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (1 - 0.15 * 0.2) = 0.18 + 0.91 = 0.89 or 89%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.89}
