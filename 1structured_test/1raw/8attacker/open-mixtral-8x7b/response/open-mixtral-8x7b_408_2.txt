Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
P(Erroneously identifies someone shorter as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, we can estimate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We have already calculated P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 and P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15. To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both the true positive rate (0.80) and the false positive rate (0.20).

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)] + [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Shorter than 185 cm) * P(Shorter than 185 cm)]
P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) â‰ˆ 0.4211

{probability: 0.4211}
