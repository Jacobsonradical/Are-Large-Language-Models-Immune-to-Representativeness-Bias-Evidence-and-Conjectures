To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = 0.8

From statement b, we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(tall) = 0.15

However, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. We can use Bayes' theorem to combine the two probabilities:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) \* P(tall) / P(witness identifies tall)

The term P(witness identifies tall) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as tall when they are truly tall and the witness identifying the attacker as tall when they are not:

P(witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) \* P(tall) + P(witness identifies tall | not tall) \* P(not tall)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(witness identifies tall) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.41 = 0.18 / 0.41 = 0.44

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.44}
