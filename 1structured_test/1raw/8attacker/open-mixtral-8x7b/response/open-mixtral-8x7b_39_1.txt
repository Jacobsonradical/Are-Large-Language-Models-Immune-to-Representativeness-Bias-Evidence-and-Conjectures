To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's determine the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person as being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80%. Next, let's determine the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%. Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm+ | Attacker is 185 cm+) = P(Correct identification) * P(Attacker is 185 cm+)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm). This is given as the complementary probability:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm+ | Attacker is shorter) = 1 - P(Witness identifies shorter | Attacker is shorter)
= 1 - 0.8 * 0.5
= 1 - 0.4
= 0.6

Given the witness's identification of an 185 cm or taller attacker, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(Attacker is 185 cm+ | Witness identifies 185 cm+) = P(Witness identifies 185 cm+ | Attacker is 185 cm+) * P(Attacker is 185 cm+) / P(Witness identifies 185 cm+)

We already have the first two terms from our previous calculations. To find the third term P(Witness identifies 185 cm+), we need to calculate the total probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person, which is the sum of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person and incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm+) = P(Witness identifies 185 cm+ | Attacker is 185 cm+) * P(Attacker is 185 cm+) + P(Witness identifies 185 cm+ | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter)
= 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.6 * 0.85
= 0.018 + 0.51
= 0.528

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm+ | Witness identifies 185 cm+) = 0.12 * 0.15 / 0.528
â‰ˆ 0.0342

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0342, or 3.42%.
