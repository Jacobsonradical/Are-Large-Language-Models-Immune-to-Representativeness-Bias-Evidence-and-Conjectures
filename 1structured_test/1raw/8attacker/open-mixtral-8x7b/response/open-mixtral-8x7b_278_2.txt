To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = A witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From statement "a", we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of erring in height judgement)

From statement "b", we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.85*0.8 = 0.17 (given an attacker is not 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness still identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
= 0.12

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
