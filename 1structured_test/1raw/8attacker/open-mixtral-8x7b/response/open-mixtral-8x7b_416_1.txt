To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of such attacks are committed by people 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
