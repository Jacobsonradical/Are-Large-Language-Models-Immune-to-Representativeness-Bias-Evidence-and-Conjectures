To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- !A: probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- !B: probability that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

From the problem, we know that:
1. The population has roughly equal numbers of people shorter and 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) ≈ P(!A).
2. The witness correctly identified a 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. The witness incorrectly identified a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(!B|!A) = 0.2.

Now, we want to estimate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A))

We can calculate P(B|!A) = 1 - P(!B|!A) = 0.8 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, they must correctly identify a shorter person as shorter 80% of the time).

Since P(A) ≈ P(!A), we can simplify Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) ≈ P(B|A) / (P(B|A) + P(B|!A)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.8) = 0.5

However, since P(A) ≈ P(!A) does not mean P(A) = P(!A), let's consider the worst-case scenario for P(A), which is P(A) = P(!A) - ε, where ε is a small positive value (ε ≈ 0).

In this case, P(A|B) would be higher than 0.5, since a smaller P(A) would make the relative impact of P(B|A) greater in the calculation.

Taking into account the information available, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:

{probability: ≥ 0.5}
