Given the information provided, let's break down the problem into two parts:

a) We know that the population has roughly an equal number of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, which is contrary to the witness's statement. Therefore, we might want to decrease our initial belief that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

b) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness could be incorrect when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- not A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))]
P(A|B) = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be 0.36 or 36%.
