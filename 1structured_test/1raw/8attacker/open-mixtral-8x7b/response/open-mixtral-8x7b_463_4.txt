Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly. This is given as 80%, so the probability of a correct identification is 0.8.

The probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller erroneously is 20%, which is the complement of the correct identification probability, so the probability of an erroneous identification is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can estimate the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller as 0.5. 

We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct identification) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

We also need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = P(Erroneous identification) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / 
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

We have calculated all the required probabilities above. We just need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller and the witness erroneously identifying an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct identification) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Erroneous identification) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) 
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / 
P(Witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
0.12 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.018 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.062

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.062 or 6.2%.
