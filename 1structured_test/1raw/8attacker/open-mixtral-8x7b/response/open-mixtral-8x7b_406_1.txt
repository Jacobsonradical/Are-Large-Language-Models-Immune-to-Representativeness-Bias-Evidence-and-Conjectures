To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height,
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is chosen from the group of people who are 185 cm or taller with equal probability,
- F as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is chosen from the general population.

From statement "a", we have P(W|E) = 0.8 and P(¬W|¬E) = 0.2 (where ¬ represents the opposite event). From statement "b", we have P(E|A) = 0.15 and P(¬E|¬A) = 0.85.

Now, we want to calculate the probability P(A), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(E) * P(A|E) + P(¬E) * P(A|¬E)

We are given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, so P(E) = P(¬E) = 0.5.

Now, we need to find P(A|E) and P(A|¬E). Since the attacker is chosen from the group of people who are 185 cm or taller, P(A|E) = 1. For P(A|¬E), given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, we have P(A|¬E) = 0.15.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.575

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.575}
