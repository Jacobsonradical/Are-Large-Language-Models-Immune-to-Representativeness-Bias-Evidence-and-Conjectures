Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This information is about the witness's accuracy, not the actual distribution of attackers' heights.

b. Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the actual distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the formula for total probability, taking into account both the accuracy of the witness and the distribution of heights in the population:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness accuracy when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (population distribution)
- P(witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness inaccuracy when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
- P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (population distribution)

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.28}
