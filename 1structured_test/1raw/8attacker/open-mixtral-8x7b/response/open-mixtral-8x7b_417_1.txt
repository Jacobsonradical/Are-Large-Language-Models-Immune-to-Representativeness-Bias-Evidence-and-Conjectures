Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy for tall people, which is 80%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, when the person is actually not that tall. This is the witness's error rate for short people, which is 20%.

Now, we know from point a that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know:
P(B|not A) is the error rate of the witness for short people, which is 20% or 0.2
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
