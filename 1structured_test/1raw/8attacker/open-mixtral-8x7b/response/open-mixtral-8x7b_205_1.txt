Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The error rate is given as 20% or 0.2, which means the witness might incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, the base rate for attackers being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person)
P(A) = 0.15 (base rate for attackers being 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, and the witness is wrong 20% of the time:

P(not A) = 0.5 (attackers under 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (error rate for identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
