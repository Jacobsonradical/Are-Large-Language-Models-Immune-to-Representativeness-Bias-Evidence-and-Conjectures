To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's statement (B).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
1. P(B|A): The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
2. P(A): The probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population, which is assumed to be 0.5 (50%).
3. P(B): This is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker of any height to be 185 cm or taller. This requires us to calculate the two cases where the attacker is both shorter and taller than 185 cm.

Let T be the event that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller, and S be the event that the attacker is truly shorter than 185 cm.
Then, P(B|S) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (20%).
And, P(B|T) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are, which is 0.8 (80%).

Now, we can calculate P(B), the unconditional probability of the witness identifying an attacker of any height to be 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|T) * P(T) + P(B|S) * P(S)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1
P(B) = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.4

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4}
