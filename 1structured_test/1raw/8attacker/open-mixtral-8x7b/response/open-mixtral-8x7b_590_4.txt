To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that, on average, the given probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, would be 0.8.

2. However, we also need to consider the base rates of attackers being 185 cm or taller from statement "b". Out of all attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. To incorporate this information, we use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) and P(~A) as the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85). Let P(W|A) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (1), and P(W|~A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.2).

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|W) = [1 * 0.15] / [1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.4688 (rounded to 0.47)

So, given the witness's statement and the base rates of attackers' heights, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.47.
