Given the information, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

2. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This implies that the witness is somewhat reliable but still makes mistakes 20% of the time.

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the given information. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and had an 80% success rate in such identifications, we can estimate the probability as:

Probability = Success rate of the witness
= 80%
= 0.8

However, it's important to note that our estimate does not account for any potential biases the witness might have or any other factors that could impact the witness's ability to accurately judge a person's height at night. Therefore, this estimate should be treated with caution.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
