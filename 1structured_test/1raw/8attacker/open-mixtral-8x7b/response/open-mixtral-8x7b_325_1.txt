Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, while only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate. This means that there is a 20% chance that the witness could be mistaken about the attacker's height.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height)
- P(A) is the probability of A (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15 (from points a and b). 

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the case where the witness is correct and the case where the witness is mistaken. Since the witness is mistaken 20% of the time, and there are two possible scenarios (attacker is taller or shorter than 185 cm), we have:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
