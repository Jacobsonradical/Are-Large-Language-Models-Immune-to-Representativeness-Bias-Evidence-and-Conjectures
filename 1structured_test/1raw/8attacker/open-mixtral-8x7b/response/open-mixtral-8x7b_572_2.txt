To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Let's calculate the probabilities needed for Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (witness accuracy)

P(A) = probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% from statement b)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of two probabilities:
1. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already have P(B|A) and P(A). Now we need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the complement of the witness's accuracy, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we need to find P(not A), the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size and 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
