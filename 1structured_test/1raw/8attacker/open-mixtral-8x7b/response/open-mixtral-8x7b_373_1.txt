Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their smaller population size.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's testimony and their ability to correctly identify height. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and assuming that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability as:

probability: 0.8

The final answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
