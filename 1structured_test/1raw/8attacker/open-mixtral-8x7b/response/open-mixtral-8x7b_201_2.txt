Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony:

P(A) = Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to the witness
= Number of correct identifications by the witness / Total number of identifications by the witness
= 0.8 (80% correct identifications)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the attacker population statistics:

P(B) = Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to population statistics
= Number of attackers who are 185 cm or taller / Total number of attackers
= 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, these probabilities are conditioned on different information, so we cannot simply multiply them together. Instead, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both pieces of information.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both pieces of information, P(B|A) is the probability of the population statistic, given the witness's testimony, P(A) is the probability of the witness's testimony, and P(B) is the probability of the population statistic.

We already have P(A) and P(B). To calculate P(B|A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B|A) = P(B and A) / P(A)

Here, P(B and A) is the probability of both the population statistic and the witness's testimony being true.

P(B and A) = P(A|B) * P(B)

We want to find P(A|B), so we can rewrite this as:

P(B and A) / P(B) = P(A|B)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (P(B and A) / P(A)) * P(A) / P(B)
= P(B and A) / P(B)

Now, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B and A) / P(B)
= 0.15 (15% chance of attacker being 185 cm or taller according to population statistics)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.15}
