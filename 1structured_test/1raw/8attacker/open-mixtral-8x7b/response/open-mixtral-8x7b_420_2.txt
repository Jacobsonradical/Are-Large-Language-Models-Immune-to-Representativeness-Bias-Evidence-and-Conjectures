Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The error rate is 20% or 0.2, but this error rate is applicable for both cases where the true height is less than 185 cm and when it is 185 cm or taller. 

To calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we need to consider both the correct identification case and the error case. 

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such)
P(not A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm are roughly equal in size)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in these values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
