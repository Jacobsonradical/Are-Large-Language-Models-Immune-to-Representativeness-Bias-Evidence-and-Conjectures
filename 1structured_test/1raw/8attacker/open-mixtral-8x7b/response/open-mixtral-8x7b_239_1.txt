Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that being 185 cm or taller might be associated with a higher likelihood of not being an attacker.

However, we have additional information that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such assessments.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

(Probability of a non-attacker being 185 cm or taller) * (Witness correct identification rate) + (Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) * (1 - Witness error rate)

We don't have exact numbers, but we can use the given information to estimate these probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of a non-attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally split), and the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 as mentioned in the question. We also know that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

So, our estimate is:

(0.5) * (0.8) + (0.15) * (0.8) + (0.15) * (1 - 0.2)
= 0.4 + 0.12 + 0.15 + 0.12
= 0.79

{probability: 0.79}
