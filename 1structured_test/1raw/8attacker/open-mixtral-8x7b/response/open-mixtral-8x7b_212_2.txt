Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This information relates to the reliability of the witness.

b) Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information relates to the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from a).

The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population is 0.15 (from b).

The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is the product of the two probabilities:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
