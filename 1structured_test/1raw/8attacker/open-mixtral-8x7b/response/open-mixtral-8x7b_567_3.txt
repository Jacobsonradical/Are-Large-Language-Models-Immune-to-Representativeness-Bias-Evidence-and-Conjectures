Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.8
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.2

The key information is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This means that the witness's identification could be correct or incorrect. We need to calculate the probability of both scenarios.

Scenario 1: Witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(185 cm or taller | Witness correct) = P(Witness correct | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(Witness correct)
= (1 * 0.15) / (0.8) = 0.1875

Scenario 2: Witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(185 cm or taller | Witness incorrect) = P(Witness incorrect | Not 185 cm or taller) * P(Not 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness incorrect)
= (0.2 * 0.85) / (1 - 0.8) = 0.17

Now, we need to calculate the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both scenarios:

P(185 cm or taller) = P(185 cm or taller | Witness correct) * P(Witness correct) + P(185 cm or taller | Witness incorrect) * P(Witness incorrect)
= (0.1875 * 0.8) + (0.17 * 0.2) = 0.174 + 0.034 = 0.208 

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.208 or 20.8%.
