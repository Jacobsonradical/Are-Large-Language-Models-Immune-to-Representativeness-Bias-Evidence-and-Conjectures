Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to be attackers in this population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the witness being correct 80% of the time and erring 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here,
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.5 (50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 0.6 = 1.3333

However, probability cannot exceed 1. It seems there is a mistake, as the given information leads to an incorrect estimation. Ideally, we would expect more information about the attacker or the witness to be able to estimate the probability.
