Let's analyze the information given:

a) We know that the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, there's a bias in attacks, with 85% of attackers being people under 185 cm.

b) A witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this witness.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the information provided.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and B represents the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are interested in finding P(A|B).

From the information provided, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of people who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of people who are not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5))
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) = 8/9

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 8/9}
