Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This means that attackers are more likely to be below 185 cm than the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185 cm attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.5 (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a not-185 cm attacker as 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.6667, or approximately 0.67 (67%)

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 67%.
