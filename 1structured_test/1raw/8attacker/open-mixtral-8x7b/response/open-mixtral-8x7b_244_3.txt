To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height
- E as the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate. So, P(W|A) = 0.8. We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(W'|A') = 0.2, where A' is the event that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller.

From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(A') = 0.85. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(A|W), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

However, we don't have information about P(W). But, we can use the law of total probability to find it:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Substituting the values we have:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Given the information and computations above, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
