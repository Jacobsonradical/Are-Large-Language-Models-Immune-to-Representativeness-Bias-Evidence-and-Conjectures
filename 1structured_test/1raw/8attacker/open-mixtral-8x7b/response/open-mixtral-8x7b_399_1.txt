To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar conditions. We can combine these two pieces of information to make a reasonable estimate.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification:

1. Witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
2. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8 (80%).

Next, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the distribution of attackers' heights:

1. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
2. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the distribution, is 0.15 (15%).

Now, we need to decide whether we trust the witness more or the distribution more. Since the witness has been assessed by the court, it is reasonable to give their identification more weight. So, let's calculate the final probability by taking a weighted average of the two probabilities:

Final probability = (probability based on witness's identification * witness reliability) + (probability based on distribution * (1 - witness reliability))

Final probability = (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2) = 0.64 + 0.03 = 0.67

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.67}
