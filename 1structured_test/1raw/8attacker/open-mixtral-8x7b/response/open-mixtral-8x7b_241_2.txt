Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The probability of them being wrong is given as 20% or 0.2.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

What we want to find is P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, and since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume P(A) = 0.5.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and where they are not, but the witness incorrectly identified them as such:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.6667, or approximately 67%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.6667}
