Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's statement.

b. The witness correctly identifies the height of a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to account for both the base rate of taller attackers (15%) and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80

To find P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to account for the base rate of taller people and the witness's error rate. We can express this as:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)]

We are given:
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.20 (witness's error rate)
- P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
