To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the attacker population.
- P(B) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.
- P(W|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are not.

From the data, we know that P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|¬A) = 0.2, P(B) = 0.15, and P(¬B) = 0.85 (where ¬B denotes the complementary event of not being 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)].

However, we don't know P(A), the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. But since the two possible heights are equally likely in the general population, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, it's reasonable to assume that P(A) is less than P(B) = 0.15.

So, even with the most favorable assumption for the prosecution that P(A) = P(B) = 0.15, we get:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.096 / 0.21 = 0.457 or 45.7%

With any more realistic assumption about P(A) being smaller than 0.15, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller would be even lower.

Therefore, {probability: 0.457 or 45.7%}. This estimate is based on the most favorable assumption for the prosecution that P(A) = P(B) = 0.15. In reality, the probability is likely to be lower.
