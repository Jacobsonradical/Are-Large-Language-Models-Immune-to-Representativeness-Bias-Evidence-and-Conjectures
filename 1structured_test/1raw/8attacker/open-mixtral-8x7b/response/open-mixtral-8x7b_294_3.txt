Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions was assessed as correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness, P(T|identified as tall) = 0.8 (probability of the attacker being tall given that the witness identified them as tall).

To estimate P(T), we need to find the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller, but we are only given that 15% of attackers are this tall (85% are shorter). Since the population is roughly evenly split between people under and over 185 cm, and assuming that attackers are chosen randomly from the population, we can estimate the base rate P(T) as follows:

P(T) ≈ (number of tall attackers) / (total number of attackers) ≈ (0.15 * total attackers) / total attackers = 0.15

However, since the witness identifications are not always correct, we can use Bayes' theorem to adjust our estimate using the witness's accuracy:

P(T|identified as tall) = P(identified as tall|T) * P(T) / P(identified as tall)

We want to find P(T), so let's rearrange the formula:

P(T) = P(T|identified as tall) * P(identified as tall) / P(identified as tall|T)

We are given P(T|identified as tall) = 0.8, and we can estimate P(identified as tall|T) ≈ 1 (since the witness is always identifying the attacker as tall when they are in fact tall).

The only term left to estimate is P(identified as tall), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is tall and errs 20% of the time when the person is short, we can estimate this probability as:

P(identified as tall) = P(identified as tall and tall) + P(identified as tall and short)
                                  = P(tall) * P(identified as tall|tall) + P(short) * P(identified as tall|short)
                                  = 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2
                                  = 0.15 + 0.17
                                  = 0.32

Now we can calculate P(T) using Bayes' theorem:

P(T) = P(T|identified as tall) * P(identified as tall) / P(identified as tall|T)
         = 0.8 * 0.32 / 1
         = 0.256

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.256}
