Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of a random person being at/above 185 cm as 0.5.

Now, since the witness identified the attacker as being at/above 185 cm, we want to find the probability that this identification is correct. We can do this using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is at/above 185 cm | Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm) = [P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm | Attacker is at/above 185 cm) * P(Attacker is at/above 185 cm)] / P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm)

We know P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm | Attacker is at/above 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate) and P(Attacker is at/above 185 cm) = 0.5 (the base rate for this group).

To calculate P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm), we need to consider both the true positives (correctly identifying someone at/above 185 cm) and false positives (erroneously identifying someone as at/above 185 cm):

P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm) = P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm | Attacker is at/above 185 cm) * P(Attacker is at/above 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm | Attacker is NOT at/above 185 cm) * P(Attacker is NOT at/above 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now we can calculate the desired probability:

P(Attacker is at/above 185 cm | Witness identifies as at/above 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, or approximately 67%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.67}
