Given the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
2. However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the witness being wrong about an attacker who is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%).

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than 185 cm, the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of that height, which is 0.8 or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
