To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(C) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the victim was attacked from behind and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|~C) * P(~C)

We already know P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(C) = 0.15. For P(B|~C), this is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The witness erred in 20% of the cases, so P(B|~C) = 0.2. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(~C) = 0.85.

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the victim was attacked from behind and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
