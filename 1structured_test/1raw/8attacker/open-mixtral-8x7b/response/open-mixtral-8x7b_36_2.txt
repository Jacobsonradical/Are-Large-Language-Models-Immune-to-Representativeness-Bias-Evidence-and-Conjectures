To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given this information.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(not A) is the probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller, which is 85%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
