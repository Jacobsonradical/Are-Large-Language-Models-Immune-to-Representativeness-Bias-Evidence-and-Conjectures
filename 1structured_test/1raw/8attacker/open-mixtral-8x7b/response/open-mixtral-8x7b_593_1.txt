To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller", and E be the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". 

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

We are given P(E|H) = 0.8 (from statement a) and P(H) = 0.15 (from statement b). We need to find P(E) to compute the probability.

Since there are two possibilities, the attacker is either 185 cm or taller or under 185 cm, we can calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|H') * P(H')

where H' is the complementary event "the attacker's height is under 185 cm" and P(H') = 0.85.

Since the witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller, P(E|H') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.345}.
