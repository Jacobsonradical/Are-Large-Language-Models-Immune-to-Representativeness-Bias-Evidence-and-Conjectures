Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is 0.8, and the probability of the attacker being actually shorter than 185 cm given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

b) 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these probabilities. Given the information in (a), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. To find P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both cases: the witness could identify the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, or the witness could erroneously identify a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 (since the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85). Therefore:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
