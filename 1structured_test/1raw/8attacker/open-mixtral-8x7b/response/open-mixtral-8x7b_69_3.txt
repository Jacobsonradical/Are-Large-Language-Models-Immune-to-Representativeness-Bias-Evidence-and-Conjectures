To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W be the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We're given P(W|H) = 0.8 (80% accuracy) and P(H) = 0.15 (15% probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W), we need to consider both the true positive rate (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are) and the false positive rate (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

The true positive rate is P(W|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the false positive rate is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume that the probability of a random person being under 185 cm is also 0.85 (85%). Therefore, the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

The false positive rate is calculated as the false positive rate when the person is actually under 185 cm:

P(W|not H) = 1 - P(not W|not H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the overall probability P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H) = 0.12 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W) = 0.12 / 0.37 â‰ˆ 0.324

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.324.
