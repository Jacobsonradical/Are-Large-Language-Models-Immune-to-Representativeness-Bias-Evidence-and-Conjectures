To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height)
- P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (population proportion of attackers under 185 cm)

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
