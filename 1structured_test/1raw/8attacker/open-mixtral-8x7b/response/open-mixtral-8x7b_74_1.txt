To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B'|A) = 0.2, where B' is the complement of B.

From statement (b), we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A') = 0.15 and P(A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'))

We need to find P(B|A') and P(B'). Since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying people as 185 cm or taller and 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, we have P(B|A') = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we need to find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')
= (0.8 \* 0.85) + (0.17 \* 0.15)
= 0.68 + 0.0255
= 0.7055

Now, let's calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.85) / 0.7055
= 0.5877 / 0.7055
= 0.833

Our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.833}
