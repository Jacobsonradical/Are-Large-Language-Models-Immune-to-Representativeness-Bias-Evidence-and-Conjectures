To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of cases). 

We can also deduce that P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.17) = 0.09 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.346

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.346.
