Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

From statement (b), the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.

Let's define:
- Event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- Event B as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|¬A) = 0.2

From statement (a), 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85

We can now calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller: P(A|B)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
