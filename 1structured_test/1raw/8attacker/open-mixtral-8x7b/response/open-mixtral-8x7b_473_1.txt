Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. The error rate is 20% or 0.2, but this error rate applies to both cases where the person's height is less than or equal to 185 cm and when it is over 185 cm.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(T) given the information.

We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or P(T) = 0.15.

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which has an 80% accuracy. So, the probability of this event given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(T) given the observed event:

P(T|observed event) = [P(observed event|T) * P(T)] / P(observed event)

We don't have information about the total number of attackers, so we cannot calculate the denominator P(observed event). However, since we're only interested in the probability P(T|observed event), we can simplify the equation:

P(T|observed event) ∝ P(observed event|T) * P(T)

Substitute the values:

P(T|observed event) ∝ 0.8 * 0.15

The ∝ symbol means "proportional to". Since we're only interested in the probability, we can calculate the constant value by normalizing:

P(T|observed event) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)]

Calculating the above expression yields:

P(T|observed event) ≈ 0.36 or 36%

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 36%.
