To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both statements "a" and "b". We will apply conditional probability here.

First, we need to calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event A) and the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (event B).

P(A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(B) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (event A) and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (event B) given that the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller (event A).

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

We can calculate P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) = P(A and B is true) / P(A is true)

We know P(A) and P(B), but we don't know the joint probability P(A and B). However, we can express this joint probability in terms of P(B) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person's height. We can assume that the witness's error rate is symmetric, meaning the witness is equally likely to say that a person is taller than 185 cm when they are not, and vice versa.

P(A and B) = P(B) * P(A|B) = 0.15 * 1 = 0.15

Now, calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A) = 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.1875

Finally, estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.1875}
