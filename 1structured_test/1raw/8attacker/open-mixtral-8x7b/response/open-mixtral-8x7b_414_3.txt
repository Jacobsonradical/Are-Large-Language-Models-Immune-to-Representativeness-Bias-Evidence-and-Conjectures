Let's break down the information given:

a. The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given this information. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (80%).
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% based on part a).
- P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identification, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  where P(B|not A) is the witness's error rate of 20% when the attacker is actually under 185 cm.

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.397

{probability: 0.397}
