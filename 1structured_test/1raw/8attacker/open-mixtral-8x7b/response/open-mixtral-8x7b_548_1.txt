Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, the attackers' heights are distributed such that 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we can estimate the probability that the attacker'
