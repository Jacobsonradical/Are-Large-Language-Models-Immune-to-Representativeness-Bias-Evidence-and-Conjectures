To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the witness's "error" is equally likely to be classifying someone as shorter than they are or taller than they are. So, the false positive rate (classifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) and the false negative rate (classifying someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are 185 cm or taller) are both 10% (20% error divided by 2).

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 80% or 0.8)
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (which is 15% or 0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.08
= 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2
= 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
