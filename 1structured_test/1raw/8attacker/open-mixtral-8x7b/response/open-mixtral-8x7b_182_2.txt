To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence provided.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to find the probability of the witness identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm given that the person is actually shorter than 1
