To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, we have:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm)

We know that:
P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 1 (since the witness correctly identified the height)
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm), we need to consider both the true positives (when the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (when the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller).

P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

We know that:
P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 1
P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85

Now we can calculate:
P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 ≈ 0.4688

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4688 or 46.88%.
