To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's testimony) = 0.8

However, this is not the final answer because we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller. To account for this prior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness's testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness's testimony)

We already know that the first term is 0.8 and the second term is 0.15. To calculate the third term, we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness's testimony) = P(witness's testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness's testimony | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

The first term is 0.8 and the second term is 0.2 (the false positive rate). The prior probabilities are 0.15 (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and 0.85 (attacker is not 185 cm or taller). Therefore,

P(witness's testimony) = (0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness's testimony) = 0.8 × 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.41.
