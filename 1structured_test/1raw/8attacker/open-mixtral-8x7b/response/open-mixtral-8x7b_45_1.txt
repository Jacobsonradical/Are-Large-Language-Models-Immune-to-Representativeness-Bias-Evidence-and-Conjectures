To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(¬A): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|¬A): probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15, P(¬A) = 0.85, P(W|A) = 0.8, and P(W|¬A) = 0.2.

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A))

Substitute the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) ≈ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
