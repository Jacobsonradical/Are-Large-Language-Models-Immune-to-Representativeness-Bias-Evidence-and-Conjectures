To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probabilities independently and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

From (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a 20% failure rate. So, P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(B|C') = 0.2, where C' is the complement of C, i.e., the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(C) = 0.15, and thus, P(C') = 0.85.

Now, we need to compute P(C'|B), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can calculate it as P(C'|B) = P(B|C') * P(C') / (P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')). After substituting the values, we get P(C'|B) = 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller: P(C|B) = 1 - P(C'|B) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83.

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.83}
