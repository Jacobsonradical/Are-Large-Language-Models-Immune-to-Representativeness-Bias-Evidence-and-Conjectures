Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This means that even though the general population is evenly split, attackers of this height are less common.

Next, let's consider the reliability of the witness. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs in 20% of cases.

Now, let's combine these pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We can do this by multiplying the base rate (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) by the reliability of the witness:

0.15 (the base rate) * 0.8 (the reliability of the witness) = 0.12

So, our estimate is that there is a 0.12, or 12%, probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
