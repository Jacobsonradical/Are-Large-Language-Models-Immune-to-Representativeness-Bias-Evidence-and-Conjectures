Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller as 0.5.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually less than 185 cm:
P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is less than 185 cm) = P(Erroneously identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

We can now calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Identified as 185 cm or taller)

P(Identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Erroneously identifies a person less than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is less than 185 cm)
P(Identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Identified as 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, or approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimal places.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.67}
