To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Given a person of height 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify the height 80% of the time. However, this also means that there is a 20% chance that the witness will erroneously identify a person as being shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the probability P(185|A), where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(185|A) = P(A|185) \* P(185) / [P(A|185) \* P(185) + P(A|<185) \* P(<185)]

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(A|185) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A|<185) = 0.15 \* 0.85 = 0.1275 (the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 15% of the time, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(185) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(<185) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1275 \* 0.85)] = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.
