Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. It's roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, only 15% of attackers are in the taller group. This suggests that, regardless of the witness's accuracy, there's a lower base rate of 185 cm or taller attackers.

Now, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a taller attacker and incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as taller. This is 0.8*0.15 (correct identification) + 0.2*0.85 (incorrect identification), which equals 0.22 (22%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.22, which equals approximately 0.545 (54.5%).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.545}
