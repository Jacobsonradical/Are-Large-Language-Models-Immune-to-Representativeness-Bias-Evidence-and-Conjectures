To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person was actually 185 cm or taller. Also, the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was not 185 cm or taller.

From statement "b", we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, this implies that people under 185 cm are more likely to be attackers.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know P(B|A) from statement "a", which is 0.8 (80%).
We know P(A) from statement "b", which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and when it is not.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know P(B|A) and P(A) as mentioned earlier.
We know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

From statement "a", we know that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20%).

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
