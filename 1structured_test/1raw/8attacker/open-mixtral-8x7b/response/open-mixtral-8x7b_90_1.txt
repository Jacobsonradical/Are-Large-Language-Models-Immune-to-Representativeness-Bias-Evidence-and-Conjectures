To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate).

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use this distribution to update our estimate. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the distribution of attackers' heights, is 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).

To estimate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the two probabilities:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the distribution of attackers' heights
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the distribution of attackers' heights
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height

Using the values from above:
- P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the distribution of attackers' heights)
- P(B) = 0.8 (the witness's correct identification rate)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.1875

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1875}
