To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the witness's accuracy by the distribution of attackers' heights. This gives us:

0.8 (witness's accuracy) x 0.15 (distribution of attackers' heights) = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
