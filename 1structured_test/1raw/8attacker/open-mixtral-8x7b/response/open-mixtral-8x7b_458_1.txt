To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185+ | Witness Identified 185+) = 0.8 (witness correct identification rate)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population:

P(185+) = 0.15 (from part b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness Identified 185+) = P(Witness Identified 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) + P(Witness Identified 185+ | <185) * P(<185)

We know P(Witness Identified 185+ | 185+) = 1 (since the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller), P(185+) = 0.15, and from part a, P(Witness Identified <185 | <185) = 0.8 and P(<185) = 0.5 (since 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). Thus,

P(Witness Identified 185+) = 1 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(185+ | Witness Identified 185+) = P(Witness Identified 185+ | 185+) * P(185+) / P(Witness Identified 185+) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.1875

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1875}
