Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly evenly split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, when it comes to attackers, 85% are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, but still, a significant number of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Next, we have the testimony of a witness who has a success rate of 80% in judging a person's height as being 185 cm or taller and an error rate of 20%. This means that the witness is more likely to correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller than to make an error in that judgment.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to consider both the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15% of attackers) and the accuracy of the witness (80% correct).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(185 cm | testimony) = P(testimony | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(testimony)

We know that P(testimony | 185 cm) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm person, which is 0.8. We also know that P(185 cm) is the base rate of 185 cm attackers, which is 0.15.

To calculate P(testimony), we need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller. In other words, we need to calculate the weighted average of the witness's accuracy for both groups:

P(testimony) = P(testimony | shorter) * P(shorter) + P(testimony | 185 cm) * P(185 cm)

We know that P(testimony | 185 cm) is 0.8, as mentioned earlier. To calculate P(testimony | shorter), we need to consider the witness's error rate of 0.2, so P(testimony | shorter) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

We also know that the population is roughly evenly split, so P(shorter) = 0.5 and P(185 cm) = 0.5.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(185 cm | testimony) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.8 * 0.15)

Calculating this value, we get:

P(185 cm | testimony) = 0.18

Therefore, based on the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 18%.
