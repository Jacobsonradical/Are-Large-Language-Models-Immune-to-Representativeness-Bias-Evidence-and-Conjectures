To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(tall | witness identified tall) = P(witness identified tall | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness identified tall)

We know that P(witness identified tall | tall) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's height)

We also know that P(tall) = 0.15 (from the distribution of attackers' heights)

To calculate P(witness identified tall), we need to take into account both the probability of the witness identifying a tall person correctly and the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a short person as tall:

P(witness identified tall) = P(witness identified tall | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness identified tall | short) * P(short)

We know that P(witness identified tall | tall) = 0.8 and P(tall) = 0.15, but we don't have information about P(witness identified tall | short). However, we do know that the witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(witness identified tall | short) = 1 - P(witness identified short | short) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

We also know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so P(short) = 1 - P(tall) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Therefore, P(witness identified tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(tall | witness identified tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
