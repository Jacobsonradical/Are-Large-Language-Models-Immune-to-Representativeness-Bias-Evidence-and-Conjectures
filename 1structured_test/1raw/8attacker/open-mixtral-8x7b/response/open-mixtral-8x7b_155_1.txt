To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the following events:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- E: The witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that the probability of H is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), and the probability of W, given H, is 0.8 (80% of the time, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller). Similarly, the probability of E, given H, is 0.2 (20% of the time, the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller).

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of H given W:

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) * P(H)) / (P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|¬H) * P(¬H))

We need to find P(W|¬H), which is the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not (¬H). Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness is equally likely to err in both directions, P(W|¬H) = 0.1 (10% of the time, the witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.5)) ≈ 0.1875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1875 or 18.75%.
