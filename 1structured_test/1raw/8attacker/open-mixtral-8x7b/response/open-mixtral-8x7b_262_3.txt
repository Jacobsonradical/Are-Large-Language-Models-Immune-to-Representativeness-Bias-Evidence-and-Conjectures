To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. Then, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We have the values for P(B|A) and P(A) directly from statement "a":

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications of the witness, using the probabilities from statement "a" and the percentages from statement "b". We can denote P(B') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, and write the formula for P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Here, P(A') is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(B|A') is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (errs 20% of the time).

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
