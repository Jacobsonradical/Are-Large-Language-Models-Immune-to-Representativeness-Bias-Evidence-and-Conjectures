Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can use this information along with the witness's assessment to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) 
= P(witness identified correctly) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified incorrectly) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8) * (0.5) + (0.2) * (0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.5}

This means there is a 50% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller based on the given information.
