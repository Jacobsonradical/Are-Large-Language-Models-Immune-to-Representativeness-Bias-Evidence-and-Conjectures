Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm and taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which means that taller people are overrepresented among attackers.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote the probability we're trying to estimate as P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data given, we can calculate P(B|A), the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

We also need to calculate P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually under 185 cm. This is given as 0.2 (20%).

Finally, we need to calculate P(A), the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equally split and taller people are overrepresented among attackers, we might estimate this as somewhere between 0.4 and 0.5. However, since the problem doesn't provide exact numbers, let's use the given information to estimate this value.

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, it means that 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
