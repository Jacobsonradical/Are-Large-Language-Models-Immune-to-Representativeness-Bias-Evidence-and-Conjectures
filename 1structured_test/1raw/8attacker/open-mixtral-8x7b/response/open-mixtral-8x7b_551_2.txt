Let's break down the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This gives us a conditional probability P(Correct|Taller) = 0.8 and P(Incorrect|Taller) = 0.2.

b) Among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability P(Taller) = 0.15.

We want to find the probability P(Taller|Correct). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(Taller|Correct) = P(Correct|Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Correct)

We need to find P(Correct), which is the overall probability of the witness giving a correct identification. This can be calculated as:

P(Correct) = P(Correct|Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Correct|Shorter) * P(Shorter)

We know P(Correct|Taller) and P(Taller). To find P(Correct|Shorter), the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm, we can use the complementary probability P(Incorrect|Shorter) = 1 - P(Correct|Taller) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we have all the necessary components to calculate P(Taller|Correct):

P(Correct) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.2) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.72 = 0.84

P(Taller|Correct) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.84 â‰ˆ 0.1429

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1429}
