Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. We'll call this P(W|T), the probability of the witness's observation (W) given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (T).

Next, we need to calculate the base rate, or the overall probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is denoted as P(T). Since the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, P(T) = 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's observation, using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)

We still need to calculate P(W), the overall probability of observing a witness identification of an 185 cm or taller person, which can be expressed as:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|F) * P(F)

We know P(W|T), P(T), and we can calculate P(F), the probability of an attacker being under 185 cm. Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, P(F) = 0.85. Since the witness is equally likely to make an error in both directions, P(W|F) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|F) * P(F)
P(W) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.585

Now, we can find P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W)
P(T|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.585 ≈ 0.683

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.683 (68.3%).
