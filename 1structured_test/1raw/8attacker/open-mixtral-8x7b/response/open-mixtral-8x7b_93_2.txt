To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.
2. Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. However, we only have information about P(B|A), the probability of identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that their actual height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B|¬A), the probability of identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that their actual height is under 185 cm.

To find P(A), we can use the following formula:

P(A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|¬A) = 0.2, and we know that P(¬A) = 0.85 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85

Rearranging the equation:

P(A) - 0.8 * P(A) = 0.17
0.2 * P(A) = 0.17

Now, we can solve for P(A):

P(A) = 0.17 / 0.2
P(A) = 0.85

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.85}
