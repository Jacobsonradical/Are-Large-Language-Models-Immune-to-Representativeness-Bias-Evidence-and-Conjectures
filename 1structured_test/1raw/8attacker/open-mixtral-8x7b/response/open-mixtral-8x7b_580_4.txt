Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. 

Since the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm, we can assume a 50/50 chance that the attacker is in either group. 

Given these assumptions, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can estimate the probability that the witness's statement is correct (that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) by multiplying the two probabilities together:

0.5 (50% chance the attacker is at/above 185 cm) * 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone at/above 185 cm) = 0.4 or 40%.

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness incorrectly identifies the height. If this happens, the witness would be mistakenly identifying someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given the 20% error rate, we can calculate the probability of this happening:

0.5 (50% chance the attacker is under 185 cm) * 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone as at/above 185 cm) = 0.1 or 10%.

To find the overall probability, we add these two probabilities together:

0.4 (probability of correct identification) + 0.1 (probability of incorrect identification) = 0.5 or 50%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.5}
