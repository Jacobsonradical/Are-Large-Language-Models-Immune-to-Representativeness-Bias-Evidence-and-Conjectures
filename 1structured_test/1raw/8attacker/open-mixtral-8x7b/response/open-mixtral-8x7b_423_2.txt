To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(~A): probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm)
- P(~B): probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

Given the information from statements "a" and "b", we can construct the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(~B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|~A) = 0.15 (witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
P(~B|~A) = 0.85 (witness errs and identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We are given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so we can assume P(A) ≈ P(~A) ≈ 0.5.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.15 * 0.5)] ≈ 0.8421

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8421}
