Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, despite the general population having an equal number of people under and over 185 cm, taller people are more likely to be attackers.

Next, we have a witness who correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case states:

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

We are given:
P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm person as such 80% of the time)
P(Attacker is 185 cm) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to compute P(Witness Identification). This is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification and Attacker is 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification and Attacker is not 185 cm)
= P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker is not 185 cm) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness Identification):

P(Attacker is 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker is 185 cm) * P(Attacker is 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
