To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar circumstances.

First, let's determine the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (from part a).

Next, let's determine the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller. This is 0.2 (from part a).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

To calculate the above probabilities, we can use the following information:

* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from part b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) x P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
* P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
* P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (from part a)

Now, we can calculate P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller):

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 x 0.15) + (0.2 x 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 x 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
