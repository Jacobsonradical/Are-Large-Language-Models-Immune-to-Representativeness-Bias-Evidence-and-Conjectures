To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is given by the true positive rate (TPR): TPR = 80% = 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is given by the false positive rate (FPR): FPR = 20% = 0.2.

Now, let's use the witness's testimony to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We know that P(B|A) is the TPR (true positive rate) of the witness, which we calculated as 0.8.

We also know that P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate from the distribution of attacker heights. We are told that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Here, ¬A is the complement of A, which is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, which we can calculate as 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We know that P(B|A) is the TPR (true positive rate) of the witness, which we calculated as 0.8, and P(B|¬A) is the false positive rate (FPR) of the witness, which we calculated as 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.3333

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.33, or 33%.
