To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height
- W' as the event that the witness errs in identifying the height

According to the given information, P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness correctly identifies the height.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')

Where A' denotes the height being shorter than 185 cm and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, P(W|A') = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying the height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
