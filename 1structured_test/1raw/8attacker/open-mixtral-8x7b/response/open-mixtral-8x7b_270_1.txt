Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

Information "a" tells us that even though the population is roughly equally split between those under and at least 185 cm tall, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm tall (85% to 15%).

Information "b" tells us that the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also erred 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time according to the given data. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness identification, is 0.8 or 80%.

So, {probability: 0.8}
