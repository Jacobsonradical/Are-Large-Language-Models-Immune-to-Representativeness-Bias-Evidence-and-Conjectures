Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80%. 

Next, we need to consider the error rate, which is given as 20%. This error rate applies when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person)
P(A) = 0.5 (the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness identifies the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
= 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
