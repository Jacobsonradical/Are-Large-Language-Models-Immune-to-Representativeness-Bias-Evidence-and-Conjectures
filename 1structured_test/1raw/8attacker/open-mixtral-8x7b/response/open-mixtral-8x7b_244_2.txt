To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
A - the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
C - the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
D - the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., less than 185 cm)

We are asked to find P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
P(B|C) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|D) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)
P(C) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(D) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / (P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
