Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from point b)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually NOT 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(identified as shorter than 185 cm | actually NOT 185 cm or taller)
= 1 - 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2

Now, we know from point a that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore,

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(actually shorter than 1
