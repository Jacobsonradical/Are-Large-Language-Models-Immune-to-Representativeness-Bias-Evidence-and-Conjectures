To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define some probabilities:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(E) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter

From the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with 80% probability)
- P(E|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with 20% probability, given that the attacker is actually shorter)

From the distribution of attackers' heights, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(E|A') * P(A'))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
