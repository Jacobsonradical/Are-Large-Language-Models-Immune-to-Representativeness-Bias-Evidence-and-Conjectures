To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(~W|A): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|S): probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(~W|S): probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85, and that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 80% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate the probabilities of the witness's identification as:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(~W|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W|S) = 0.16 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- P(~W|S) = 0.84 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(A|W) = P(W and A) / P(W)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and S)
= P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|S) * P(S)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.16 * 0.85
≈ 0.184

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W and A) / P(W)
= P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.184
≈ 0.652

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.652}
