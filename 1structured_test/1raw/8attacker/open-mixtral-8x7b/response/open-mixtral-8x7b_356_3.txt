Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. Half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and half is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the witness would err 20% of the time, and 20% of the attacks are committed by people who are 185 cm or taller. This means that there is a 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 probability (10%) that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and we know that there's a 10% chance that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, this means that the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is:

0.85 - 0.1 = 0.75 or 75%

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.75}
