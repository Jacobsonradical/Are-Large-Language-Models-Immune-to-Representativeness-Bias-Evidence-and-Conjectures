To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we consider the distribution of attackers' heights. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of the attacker being under 185 cm is:

P(Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) \* P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We don't have information about the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, so we cannot calculate the exact probability. However, we can use the witness's accuracy to estimate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified correctly) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified incorrectly) \* P(Attacker is under 185 cm)

Substituting the known probabilities, we get:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)))

Rearranging for P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller), we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) - 0.2) / 0.6

Since we don't have information about the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we cannot provide a numerical estimate of the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, using the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights, we can estimate that the probability is less than 50% but more than the 15% baseline probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: between 0.15 and 0.5, but likely closer to 0.15}
