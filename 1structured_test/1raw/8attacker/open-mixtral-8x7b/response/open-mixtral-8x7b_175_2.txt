To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. According to statement "a", this probability is 0.8 (80%).
2. Next, we need to find the probability of an attacker actually being 185 cm or taller. According to statement "b", this probability is 0.15 (15%).
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can multiply these two probabilities: 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
