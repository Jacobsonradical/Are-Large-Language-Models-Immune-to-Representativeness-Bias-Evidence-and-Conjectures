To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities. 

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We're given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.50 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we assume the witness guesses correctly half the time)

We want to find: P(A|B)

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, calculate P(not A):
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate the denominator of Bayes' theorem:
P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.50 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.425
= 0.545

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.545
â‰ˆ 0.2165

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2165 or 21.65%.
