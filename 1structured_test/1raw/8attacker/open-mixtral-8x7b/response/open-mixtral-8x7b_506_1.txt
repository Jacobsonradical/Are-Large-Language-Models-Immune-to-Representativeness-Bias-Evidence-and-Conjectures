To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's use this information to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified height as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified correctly) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
