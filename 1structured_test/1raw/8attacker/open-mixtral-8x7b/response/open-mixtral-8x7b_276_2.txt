Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a false positive and a true positive:

1. False positive (witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not): Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the probability of a false positive is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 (or 10%).
2. True positive (witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller and they are indeed 185 cm or taller): Since the witness is correct 80% of the time and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the probability of a true positive is 0.5 * 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.06 (or 6%).

Now, to find the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We calculated P(B|A) above as 0.06 (6%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, and assuming the attacker is a random selection from the attacker population, P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the true positive rate and the false positive rate: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). We already have P(B|A) and P(A), and since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%), and P(B|not A) is the false positive rate of 0.1 (10%), we can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = (0.06 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85) = 0.009 + 0.085 = 0.094 (9.4%).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.06 * 0.15) / 0.094 â‰ˆ 0.094 (or 9.4%).

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 9.4%.
