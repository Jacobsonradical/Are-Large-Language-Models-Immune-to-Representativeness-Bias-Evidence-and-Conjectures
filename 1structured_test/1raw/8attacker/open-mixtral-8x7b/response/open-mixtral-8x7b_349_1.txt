Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a 185 cm or taller attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80%)
P(B|¬A) = Probability that the witness identifies a below 185 cm attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (20%)
P(¬A) = Probability that a random attacker is below 185 cm = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.36}
