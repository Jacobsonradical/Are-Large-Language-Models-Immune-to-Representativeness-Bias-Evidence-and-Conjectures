Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be shorter than taller.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:
- Event A is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138
