To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided in both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and P(U) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information from statement "a", we have:
P(U | T) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height)
P(U' | T) = 0.2 (probability of making an error in identifying the height)

Given the information from statement "b", we have:
P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller)
P(T') = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker's height being under 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(T | U), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T | U) = (P(U | T) * P(T)) / P(U)

We need to find P(U), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(U) = P(U | T) * P(T) + P(U | T') * P(T')

Substituting the values:
P(U) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculating P(T | U):
P(T | U) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
