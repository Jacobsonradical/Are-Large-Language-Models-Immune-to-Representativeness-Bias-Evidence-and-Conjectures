To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

1. From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. We can use this to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

   P(taller | identified as taller) = 0.8

2. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter. We can use this to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or shorter given that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

   P(shorter | identified as shorter) = 0.85

3. We can combine these probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

   P(taller) = P(taller and identified as taller) + P(taller and identified as shorter)
   P(taller) = P(identified as taller | taller) * P(taller) + P(identified as taller | shorter) * P(shorter)
   P(taller) = 0.8 * P(taller) + 0.2 * (1 - P(taller))

4. Solving for P(taller), we get:

   P(taller) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.3684

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3684.
