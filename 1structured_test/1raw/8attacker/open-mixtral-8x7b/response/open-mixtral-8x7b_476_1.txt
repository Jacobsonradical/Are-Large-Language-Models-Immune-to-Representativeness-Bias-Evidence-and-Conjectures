Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 1
