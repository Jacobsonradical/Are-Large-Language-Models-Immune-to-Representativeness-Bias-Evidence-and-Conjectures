Let's break down the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identification is 0.8 and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the witness identification is 0.2.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm. This is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness identification.

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the witness's identification.

P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability of the witness's identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker correctly as 185 cm or taller and incorrectly as shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15) = 0.18 + 0.24 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.42 â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2857 or 28.57%.
