To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights in similar situations.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. Given a sample of people containing an equal number of individuals shorter than 185 cm and taller than or equal to 185 cm, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the witness's testimony provides us with some information, but it is not perfect.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that, even though the population of people taller than 185 cm might be roughly equal in size to those shorter than 185 cm, attackers of this height are relatively rare.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

* A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

To find P(B|not A), we can use the witness's error rate:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness errs 20% of the time)

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
