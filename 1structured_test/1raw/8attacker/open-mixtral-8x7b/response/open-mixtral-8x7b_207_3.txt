To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies people of a certain height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Given this information, let's calculate the probability:

The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from statement "a"). Since the witness made a correct identification 80% of the time, this means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness correctly identified this.

However, there's also a 20% chance that the witness erred in their identification (from statement "a"). Given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (from statement "b"), this means that if the attacker was actually under 185 cm, there's still a chance the witness might claim they saw an attacker of 185 cm or taller.

To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of erroneously identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (probability that the attacker is under 185 cm)

Plugging these values in, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
