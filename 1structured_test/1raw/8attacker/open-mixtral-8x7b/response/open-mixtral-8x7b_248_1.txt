Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more prone to committing attacks.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. The witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the problem, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.5 (given the population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm).

What we want to find is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We don't have P(B) directly, but we can calculate it as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.5, and P(not A) = 0.5. To calculate P(B|not A), it's the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone below 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.6 = 0.6667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (67%).
