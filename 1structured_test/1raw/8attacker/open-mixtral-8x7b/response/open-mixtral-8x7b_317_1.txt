To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller, as well as the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker was actually under 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(U) as the probability that the attacker's height was under 185 cm
- P(W|T) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- P(W|U) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually under 185 cm

From statement "a", we know that P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|U) = 0.2. From statement "b", we know that P(T) = 0.15 and P(U) = 0.85.

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|U) \* P(U)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)]
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.36}.
