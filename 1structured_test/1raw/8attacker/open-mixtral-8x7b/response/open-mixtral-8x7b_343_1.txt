Given the information provided, let's first consider the general population: it's evenly split between people under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. 

However, the witness's accuracy needs to be factored in. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker was actually under 185 cm, there's still a 20% chance the witness would say they were 185 cm or taller.

The statement "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller" suggests that the attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm. But without knowing the actual height of the attacker, we can't use this information directly.

The key piece of information is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy rate, this identification implies a higher probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.
- P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not.

From the problem statement, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since the population is evenly split, we have P(A) = 0.5 and P(not A) = 0.5.

We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 80%.
