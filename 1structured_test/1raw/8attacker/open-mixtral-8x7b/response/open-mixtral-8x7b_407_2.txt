Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly evenly split between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which is against the general population trend.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's statistics. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement would be 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to consider that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% chance based on the information in part a). This means that the witness might have been more likely to make an error in this case. Nonetheless, without further information about the specific conditions or factors influencing this particular attack, we can only rely on the given statistics.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
