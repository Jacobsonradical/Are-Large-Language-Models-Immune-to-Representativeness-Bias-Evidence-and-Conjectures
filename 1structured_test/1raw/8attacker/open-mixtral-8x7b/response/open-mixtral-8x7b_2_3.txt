To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such. Since the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time, the probability is:

0.8 (witness accuracy) * (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification. Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, we have:

0.5 (population proportion) * 0.15 (proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine these probabilities:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have:

P(B | A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
P(A) = 0.075 (population proportion and attacker proportion combined)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

To calculate P(B and A), we have:

P(B and A) = P(B | A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.075 = 0.06

To calculate P(B and not A), we need to find the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they were not. Since the witness erred 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we have:

P(B and not A) = P(not A) * P(B | not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.06 + 0.17 = 0.23

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.075 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.265

Response: {probability: 0.265}
