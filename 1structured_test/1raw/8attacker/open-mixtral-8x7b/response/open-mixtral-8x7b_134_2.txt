Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's ability to judge height:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) 
= P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) 
= 0.8 * 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size)
= 0.4

However, we also need to consider the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the distribution of attacker heights in the population:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Selected from the 15% group) * P(Selected from the 15% group) 
+ P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Selected from the 85% group) * P(Selected from the 85% group)
= 1 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.1275
= 0.2775

Since we have two different probabilities, we need to use the law of total probability to combine them:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) 
= P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) 
+ P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter) * P(Witness identified as shorter)

We already know the first term, and the second term can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as shorter) 
= P(Witness identified as shorter | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as shorter)
= (1 - 0.8) * 0.2775 / (1 - 0.8 * 0.5) (using the probability calculated earlier)
= 0.2 * 0.2775 / 0.35
= 0.1515

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) 
= 0.4 * 0.5 + 0.1515 * 0.5
= 0.2 + 0.07575
= 0.27575

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.27575}
