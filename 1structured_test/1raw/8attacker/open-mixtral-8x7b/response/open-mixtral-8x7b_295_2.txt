Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this category.

Given these details, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume two hypotheses:
- H0: The attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller.
- H1: The attacker IS 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H1|E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|E) = [P(E|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(E|H1) * P(H1) + P(E|H0) * P(H0)]

From the problem:
- P(H1) = P(H0) = 0.5 (equal probabilities for both height categories)
- P(E|H1) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of people taller than or equal to 185 cm as such)
- P(E|H0) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(H1|E):

P(H1|E) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(H1|E) = 0.8 / 1
P(H1|E) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
