Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) is 0.8, and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) is 0.2.

We know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, even though the population is roughly equal in size for both height categories, the proportion of attackers in each category is not equal. This skews the probability of a randomly selected attacker being 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, given the information provided, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
