Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(not A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying a truly 185 cm or taller attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness identifying a truly shorter-than-185-cm attacker as 185 cm or taller

We know that:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
