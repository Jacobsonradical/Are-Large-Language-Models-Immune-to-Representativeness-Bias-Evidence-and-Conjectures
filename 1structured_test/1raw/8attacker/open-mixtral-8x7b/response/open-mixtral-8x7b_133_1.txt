To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(B'|C') = 0.8 (complementary probability).

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(C) = 0.15 and P(C') = 0.85 (complementary probability).

We want to find P(C|B), which can be computed using Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

Now we need to find P(B) which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')
= (0.8)*(0.15) + P(B|C') * (0.85)

However, we don't have enough information to find P(B|C'), so we cannot directly calculate P(C|B). 

But, we can still make an educated estimate. If the witness is more likely to make an error in underestimating the height rather than overestimating it, given that they made an error, we can assume the attacker is more likely to be taller than 185 cm. This assumption is consistent with the information that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Thus, considering this assumption, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: close to 1}
