To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W represent the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(W), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
