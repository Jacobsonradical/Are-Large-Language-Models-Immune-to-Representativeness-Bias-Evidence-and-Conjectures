Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this witness.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we are missing one crucial piece of information: P(not A), the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm. Since we are only given information about the proportion of attackers that are 185 cm or taller, we cannot directly calculate P(not A).

Without P(not A), we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. If we had more information about the proportion of attackers under 185 cm, we could calculate this probability.
