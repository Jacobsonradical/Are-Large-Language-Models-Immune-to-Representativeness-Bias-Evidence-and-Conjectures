Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%).
b. The witness correctly identifies a person as at/above 185 cm 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "attacker's height is at/above 185 cm"
- W as the event "witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm"

From (a), P(A) = 0.5 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.5 (as the population distribution is given as roughly equal)
From (b), we have the conditional probabilities: P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W'|A) = 0.2 (where W' is the event "witness identified the attacker as below 185 cm")
Also from (b), we have the conditional probabilities: P(W|A') = 0.2 and P(W'|A') = 0.8 (where A' is the event "attacker's height is below 185 cm")

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker's height was at/above 185 cm given that the witness identified the attacker as at/above 185 cm. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

To calculate P(W), we'll use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')
= 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5
= 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)
= 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5
= 0.8

However, we should adjust for the witness's error rate. When the attacker's height is at/above 185 cm, the witness will correctly identify it as such with a probability of 0.8. Thus, our final estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
