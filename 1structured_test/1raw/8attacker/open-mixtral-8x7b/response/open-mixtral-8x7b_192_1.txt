Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and then the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller erroneously.

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Correctly identifies height) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, according to the given information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. But, the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. So, we need to calculate the probability of this event happening, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and also given that the witness might err.

P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Actual height is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) * P(Actual height is 185 cm or taller) + P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(Actual height is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

However, this is not the final answer. We also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Given that the population is roughly equal in size for both categories, the probability of this event happening is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 or 85%.

In this case, if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, then the witness identified the attacker's height erroneously.

P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Actual height is not 185 cm or taller) = P(Erroneously identifies as 185 cm or taller) * P(Actual height is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.17 or 17%

Now, to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem.

P(Actual height is 185 cm or taller | Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(Actual height is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [0.29 * 0.15] / [(0.29 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85)]
= 0.0435 / (0.0435 + 0.1445)
= 0.0435 / 0.188
= 0.2314 or 23.14%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 23.14%.
