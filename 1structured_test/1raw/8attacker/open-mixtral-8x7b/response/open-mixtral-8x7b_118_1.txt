To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"
- C as the event "the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller"
- D as the event "the attacker is under 185 cm"

From statement "a", we can compute the conditional probability P(B|C) = 0.8 and P(D|C) = 0.2. From statement "b", we can compute the conditional probability P(C) = 0.15 and P(D) = 0.85.

Now, we want to calculate P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = (P(B|C) * P(C)) / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|D) * P(D)

However, we don't have direct information about P(B|D). We can use the law of total probability to express P(B) differently:

P(B) = P(B ∩ C) + P(B ∩ D)

Using the conditional probabilities, we can express P(B ∩ C) and P(B ∩ D):

P(B ∩ C) = P(B|C) * P(C) = (0.8) * (0.15)
P(B ∩ D) = P(B|D) * P(D) = P(B|D) * (0.85)

Now, we need to find a relationship between P(B ∩ D) and P(B|D) and the known values. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying people taller than 185 cm, it means that when the witness identifies someone as taller than 185 cm and they are actually under 185 cm, the witness is mistaken in 20% of those cases. Thus, the probability of the witness identifying someone under 185 cm as taller than 185 cm is 0.2. Using this, we can write:

P(B ∩ D) = 0.2 * P(D) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B ∩ C) + P(B ∩ D) = (0.8) * (0.15) + 0.17 = 0.255

Finally, we can calculate P(C|B):

P(C|B) = (P(B|C) * P(C)) / P(B) = ((0.8) * (0.15)) / (0.255) ≈ 0.4667

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4667 or 46.67%.
