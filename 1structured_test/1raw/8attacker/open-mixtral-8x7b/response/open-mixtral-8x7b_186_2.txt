Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the distribution among attackers is different, with 85% being under 185 cm and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's bring in the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these facts, even though the general population is evenly divided in terms of height, the attackers are not. Since the witness is more likely to be correct about taller people (given the 80% success rate), and taller people are less common among attackers, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than 50%.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We also need to calculate P(¬A), the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85. And we need P(B), which we can calculate as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.414.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
