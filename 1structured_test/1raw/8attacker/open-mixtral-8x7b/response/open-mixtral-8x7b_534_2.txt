Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, there is still a 20% chance that the witness will say he is.

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, it would be reasonable to assume that 50% of potential attackers are shorter than 1
