Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their estimation abilities were assessed. They are correct 80% of the time when judging height and err 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W as the event "witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We want P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are told:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't have enough information about P(W), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This would require knowing the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller and the base rate of non-attackers being 185 cm or taller.

Since we cannot calculate P(W), we cannot calculate P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
