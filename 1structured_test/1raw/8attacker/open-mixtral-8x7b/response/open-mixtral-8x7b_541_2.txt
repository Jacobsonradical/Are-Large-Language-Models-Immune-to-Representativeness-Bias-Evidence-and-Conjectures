Let's analyze the information given:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This gives us a conditional probability P(Correct Identification | Height >= 185 cm) = 0.8 and P(Error | Height >= 185 cm) = 0.2.

b. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, which gives us a prior probability P(Height >= 185 cm) = 0.15.

We want to find the probability P(Height >= 185 cm | Correct Identification). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(Height >= 185 cm | Correct Identification) = P(Correct Identification | Height >= 185 cm) * P(Height >= 185 cm) / P(Correct Identification)

We need to find P(Correct Identification), which is the sum of P(Correct Identification | Height >= 185 cm) * P(Height >= 185 cm) and P(Correct Identification | Height < 185 cm) * P(Height < 185 cm).

Using the witness's statistics, P(Correct Identification | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 and P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(Correct Identification):

P(Correct Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find the probability P(Height >= 185 cm | Correct Identification):

P(Height >= 185 cm | Correct Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to 0.41)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
