Let's analyze the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. This means there is an 80% chance that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will identify the attacker as such. Conversely, there is a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. However, we know that the witness tends to overestimate people's heights, as evidenced by the error rate in (a).

Now, let's estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

We want to find P(Heighter | Witness report), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's report of this height.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(Heighter | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Heighter) * P(Heighter) / P(Witness report)

We're given P(Witness report | Heighter) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 80% of people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(Heighter) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(Witness report). Instead, we can use the law of total probability and consider the two possible scenarios:
- The attacker is 185 cm or taller (Heighter)
- The attacker is under 185 cm (Under)

P(Witness report) = P(Witness report | Heighter) * P(Heighter) + P(Witness report | Under) * P(Under)

We know P(Witness report | Heighter) = 0.8 and P(Heighter) = 0.15. 
We also know that if the attacker is under 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly report a taller height 20% of the time: P(Witness report | Under) = 0.2
Finally, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm: P(Under) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(Witness report):
P(Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28

Now we can find P(Heighter | Witness report):
P(Heighter | Witness report) = P(Witness report | Heighter) * P(Heighter) / P(Witness report)
P(Heighter | Witness report) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.3571

Answer: {probability: 0.3571}
