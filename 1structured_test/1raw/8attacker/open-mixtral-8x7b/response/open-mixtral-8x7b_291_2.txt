Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them mistakenly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 80% = 0.8
P(error) = 20% = 0.2

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, we can assume that the probability of a random person being under or over 185 cm is 0.5 for each.

P(attacker is over 185 cm) = 0.5
P(attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.5

Now, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as over 185 cm given that they saw an attacker over 185 cm. This is calculated as:

P(ID over 185 cm | attacker is over 185 cm) = P(correct ID) = 0.8

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as over 185 cm given that they saw an attacker under 185 cm. This is calculated as:

P(ID over 185 cm | attacker is under 185 cm) = P(error) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification by using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is over 185 cm | ID over 185 cm) = [P(ID over 185 cm | attacker is over 185 cm) * P(attacker is over 185 cm)] / P(ID over 185 cm)

We need to find P(ID over 185 cm), which is calculated as:
P(ID over 185 cm) = P(ID over 185 cm | attacker is over 185 cm) * P(attacker is over 185 cm) + P(ID over 185 cm | attacker is under 185 cm) * P(attacker is under 185 cm)
P(ID over 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification:

P(attacker is over 185 cm | ID over 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, approximately 67%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.67, or 67%}.
