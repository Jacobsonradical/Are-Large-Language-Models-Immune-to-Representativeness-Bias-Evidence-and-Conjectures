To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8).
- P(W|B) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.2).

We are also given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. So:
P(A) = 0.15
P(B) = 0.85

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)]

P(W|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12

P(W|B) * P(B) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17

P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
