Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down the information:
1. The population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
2. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is the product of the probability of the witness being correct and the base rate of attackers 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correct and Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

= P(Witness correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

= 0.80 * 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
