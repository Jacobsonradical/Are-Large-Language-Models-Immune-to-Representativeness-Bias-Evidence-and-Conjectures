To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the person is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are, so P(B|A) = 0.8. The population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than 185 cm, so P(A) = 0.5 (since half of the population is taller than or equal to 185 cm).

To calculate P(B), we need to take into account the distribution of attackers' heights. Statement (b) tells us that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. When the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, they could be correct with a probability of 0.8 (from statement a) or they could be wrong, mistaking someone shorter than 185 cm as taller. The probability of this error is 0.2 (also from statement a). So,

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 1.38 (but the probability should be between 0 and 1)

Since our calculation resulted in a probability greater than 1, something went wrong, which might be due to the provided information having some inconsistency or approximation. However, given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, it's still intuitively more likely that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller. Thus, even though our calculation didn't provide a valid probability, it suggests that the probability is relatively low.
