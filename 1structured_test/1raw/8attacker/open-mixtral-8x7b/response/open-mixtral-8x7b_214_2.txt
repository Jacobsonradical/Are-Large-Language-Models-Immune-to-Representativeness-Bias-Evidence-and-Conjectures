Given the information, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. This means that there are about as many people who could potentially be attackers in each group (below/at 185 cm).

2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still make an estimate based on the witness's ability to judge height.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here,
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- Event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (50% chance of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given equal population sizes)
- P(not A) = 0.5

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we find that:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.8}
