To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:

A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B| not A) = 0.20 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(B| A) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

Calculating the terms:

P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B| not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

So,

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.41, this is our estimate. The witness's identification increases our probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, but it is still more likely that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.}
