To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the reliability of the witness and the distribution of attackers' heights among the population.

1. Witness reliability: The witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time.

2. Population distribution: 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = P(witness says attacker is ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker is actually ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness says attacker is < 185 cm) * P(attacker is actually ≥ 185 cm)

We are given that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, P(witness says attacker is ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Likewise, the witness erroneously identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, P(witness says attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.2 when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(attacker is actually ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15.

Now, we can find the probability using the law of total probability:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 or 15%.
