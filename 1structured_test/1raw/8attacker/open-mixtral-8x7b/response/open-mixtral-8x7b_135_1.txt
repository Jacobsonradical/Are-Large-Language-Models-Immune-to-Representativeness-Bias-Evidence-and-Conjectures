Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm and taller. This indicates that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We are looking for the probability P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 80%.

Next, let's find P(A). This is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the information provided in part a.

Now, we need to find P(B). This is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for both correct and incorrect identifications:
- P(B and A): probability of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.8 * 0.15
- P(B and not A): probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller: 0.2 * 0.85

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

After calculating each term and plugging them into Bayes' theorem, we get an estimated probability of approximately 0.357 or 35.7% that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
