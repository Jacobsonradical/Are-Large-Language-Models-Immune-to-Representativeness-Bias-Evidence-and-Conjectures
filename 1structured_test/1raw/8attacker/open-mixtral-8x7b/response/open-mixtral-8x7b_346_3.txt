Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This means that even though there are many people in the general population who are 185 cm or taller, a smaller percentage of attackers fall into this category.

Next, we have the testimony of a witness who has a success rate of 80% in judging a person's height as 185 cm or taller. The witness also has a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we cannot calculate the exact probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we can say that the witness's testimony increases the probability, given that the witness has an 80% success rate in correctly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can estimate that the probability is higher than 15% but cannot provide an exact number without more information.

{probability: higher than 0.15, but cannot provide an exact number without more information}
