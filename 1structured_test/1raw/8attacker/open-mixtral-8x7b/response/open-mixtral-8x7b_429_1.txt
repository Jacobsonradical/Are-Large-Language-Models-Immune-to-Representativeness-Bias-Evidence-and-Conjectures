Let's first define some events:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness correctly identified the height of the attacker.
- Event C: The attacker is chosen from the group that is 185 cm or taller, which has a 15% probability based on the information given.

From the information provided, we can calculate the probability of event B given event A, which is 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

However, we want to find the probability of event A given the observation of the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

P(B|A) is given as 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height of the attacker when they are 185 cm or taller.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15, as mentioned in the problem statement.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

The probability of the witness identifying the height correctly if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller is given as 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time). The prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller is 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of event A given event B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
