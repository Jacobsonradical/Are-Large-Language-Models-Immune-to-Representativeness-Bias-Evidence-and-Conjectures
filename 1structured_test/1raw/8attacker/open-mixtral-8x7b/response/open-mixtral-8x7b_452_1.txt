Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of them are by people under 185 cm. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

However, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments. 

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8. 

However, we also know that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, which might make us doubt the witness's identification. But without additional information about how often witnesses are correct in cases where they identify an attacker as being under 185 cm, we can't adjust this estimate.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.8}
