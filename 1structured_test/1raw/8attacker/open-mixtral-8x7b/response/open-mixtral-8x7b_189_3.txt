Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID) = 0.8
P(incorrect ID) = 0.2

From the given data, we know that the population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H) is 0.5, and the probability of the attacker being under 185 cm (H') is also 0.5.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker's actual height:

P(ID of 185 cm or taller | H) = P(correct ID) = 0.8
P(ID of 185 cm or taller | H') = P(incorrect ID) = 0.2

Applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(H | ID of 185 cm or taller) = [P(ID of 185 cm or taller | H) * P(H)] / [P(ID of 185 cm or taller | H) * P(H) + P(ID of 185 cm or taller | H') * P(H')]
P(H | ID of 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(H | ID of 185 cm or taller) = 0.40 / 0.50
P(H | ID of 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
