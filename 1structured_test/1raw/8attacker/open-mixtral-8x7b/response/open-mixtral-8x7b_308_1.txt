To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

From statement "a", P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(W'|H) = 0.2
From statement "b", P(H) = 0.15 and P(H') = 0.85

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we are in the W event. So, we need to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|H') * P(H')
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
