To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the general population and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (80%)
- P(B|~A): probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller (20%)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

However, we don't have enough information to determine P(A), the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. We only know the distribution of heights in the general population.

So, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate. But, given that the witness is relatively accurate in identifying people as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller should be considered reasonably high. If the witness is known to be unbiased, the fact that they identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller could be considered evidence in favor of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
