To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the general population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider that the population is roughly equally divided between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. This is given in statement (a). However, we know that the attackers are not equally divided in this regard, with 85% being under 185 cm and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
