To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given two pieces of information, a and b, which we can use to calculate the posterior probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)
- P(¬A|B) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of cases when identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|B) = 1 - P(¬A|B) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
