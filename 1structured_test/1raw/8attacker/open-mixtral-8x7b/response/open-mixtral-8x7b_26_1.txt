Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correct) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(incorrect) = 1 - P(correct) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We know:
P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(correct) = 0.80
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.50 (given that the population is roughly equal)

To calculate P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness:

P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50) = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.50
= 0.80

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.80}
