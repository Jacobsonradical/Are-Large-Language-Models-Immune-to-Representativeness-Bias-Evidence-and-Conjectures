Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20 (20% error rate)

Next, we need to consider that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at or above 185 cm. Given this, when a witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there are two possible scenarios:

1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness made an error by identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability of the first scenario being true. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.80 (80% correct identification rate)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (20% error rate)
P(A) = 0.50 (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

However, to calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios (A and not A), which leads to:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50)
= 0.60

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60
= 0.6667

Given the information available, there is approximately a 66.67% (67% when rounded) chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Answer: {probability: 0.6667}
