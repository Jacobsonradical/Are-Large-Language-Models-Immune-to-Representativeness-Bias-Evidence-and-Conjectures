Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80% or 0.8. However, since the witness can also make mistakes, we need to account for the 20% error rate. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:

P(Tall | Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We are given P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 and P(Tall) = 0.5 (from point a). We need to calculate P(Witness). Since there are equal numbers of short and tall people, and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(Witness) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall, which is:

P(Witness) = P(Witness | Short) * P(Short)
                    = 0.2 * 0.5
                    = 0.1

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.1
                          = 4

Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, we need to normalize this value:

P(Tall | Witness) = 4 / (4 + 1)
                          = 4 / 5
                          = 0.8

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
