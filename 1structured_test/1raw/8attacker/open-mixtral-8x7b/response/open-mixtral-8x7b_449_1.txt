To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the following events:
- W: The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.
- E: The attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- F: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that P(W) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time) and P(E) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we want to find P(E|F), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such.

To find P(E|F), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(E|F) = P(F|E) * P(E) / P(F)

We are given P(W) = 0.8 and P(E) = 0.15, but we don't have P(F) directly. Instead, let's find P(F) using the law of total probability:

P(F) = P(F|E) * P(E) + P(F|¬E) * P(¬E)

We are given P(W) = 0.8, so P(¬W) = 1 - P(W) = 0.2. Since the witness is mistaken 20% of the time, P(¬W|E) = 0.2. Using this information, we can calculate P(F|¬E):

P(F|¬E) = P(F ∩ ¬E) / P(¬E) = P(F|¬W) * P(¬W) / P(¬E)

We can find P(¬E) using the fact that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal:

P(¬E) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we know that P(F|¬W) = 1 - P(¬F|¬W) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since the witness is mistaken 20% of the time and the population is roughly evenly split, the probability of the witness identifying someone as taller than 185 cm when they are not is the same as the witness correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are). Therefore, we can calculate P(F|¬E):

P(F|¬E) = P(F ∩ ¬E) / P(¬E) = P(F|¬W) * P(¬W) / P(¬E) = 0.8 * 0.2 / 0.85 ≈ 0.1941

Now, we have all the values needed to calculate P(E|F):

P(E|F) = P(F|E) * P(E) / P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1941 * 0.85) ≈ 0.2865

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2865 or 28.65%.
