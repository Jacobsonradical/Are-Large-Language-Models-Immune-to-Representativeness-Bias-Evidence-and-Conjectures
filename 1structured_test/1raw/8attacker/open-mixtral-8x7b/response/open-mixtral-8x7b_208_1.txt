Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

Given this, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:

P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate P(identified as 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:
P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | not 185 cm or taller) * P(not 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.6

Substituting back into the first equation, we get:
P(185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8)(0.5) / (0.6) = 0.6667, or approximately 0.67.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.67}
