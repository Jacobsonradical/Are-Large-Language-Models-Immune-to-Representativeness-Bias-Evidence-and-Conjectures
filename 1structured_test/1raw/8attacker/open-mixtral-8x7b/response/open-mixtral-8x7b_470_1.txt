Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. In 80% of the cases, the witness correctly identified the height, while in 20% of the cases, they erred.

Given this information, let's estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

The witness's accuracy is 80% for identifying people taller than 185 cm, and they erred in 20% of the cases. This means that, when they identify someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken.

Since the attacker was identified as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time in these cases, the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
