Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

Now, we know from the given information that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so we can assume a 50/50 chance of the attacker being either height.

Given this, and applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller)] / [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) * P(actually shorter than 185 cm)]

Using the values calculated previously, we get:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
