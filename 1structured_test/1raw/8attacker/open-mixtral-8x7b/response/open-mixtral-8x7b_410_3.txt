Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the witness's ability to judge a person's height:

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
2. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%).
3. However, we don't know if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To account for this, we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is given by the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller: 0.15 (15%).
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

   P(A=185 or taller | Witness identifies A as 185 or taller) = (P(Witness identifies A as 185 or taller | A=185 or taller) * P(A=185 or taller)) / P(Witness identifies A as 185 or taller)
   
   We don't know the denominator, but we can still calculate the numerator:

   Numerator = (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.12

   Since the base rates sum to 1, the denominator is the sum of the base rates, P(A=shorter than 185) + P(A=185 or taller) = 0.85 + 0.15 = 1.

   Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

   P(A=185 or taller) = 0.12 / 1 = 0.12

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.12}
