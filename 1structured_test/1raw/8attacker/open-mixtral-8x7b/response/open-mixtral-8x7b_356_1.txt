Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this particular scenario.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We are looking for P(A).

From the information given, we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A|Correct) = 0.8. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(A|Incorrect) = 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to determine the overall probability of the witness being correct. We need to know the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the population. Without this information, we cannot provide an accurate estimate.

If we had the base rate, we could calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(Correct|A) * P(A) / (P(Correct|A) * P(A) + P(Incorrect|A) * P(not A))

Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(Correct), we cannot provide an estimate for P(A).
