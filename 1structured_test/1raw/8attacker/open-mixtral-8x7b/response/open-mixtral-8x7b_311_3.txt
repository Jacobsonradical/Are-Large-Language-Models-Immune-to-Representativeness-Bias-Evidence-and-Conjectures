To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define the following events:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- L: The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- W: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.
- E: The witness erroneously identifies the attacker's height.

We know that P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(E|L) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to judge a person's height). Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, let's assume that P(L) = P(H) = 0.5. We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(L|attack) = 0.85 and P(H|attack) = 0.15.

Now, we want to find P(H|attack and witness identification), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker matches the witness's description.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(H|attack and witness identification) = P(attack and H and W) / P(attack and W)

First, we need to find P(attack and W):
P(attack and W) = P(W|attack) * P(attack)
= P(W and H|attack) * P(H|attack) + P(W and L|attack) * P(L|attack)
= P(W|H) * P(H|attack) + P(W|L) * P(L|attack)

We know P(W|H), P(H|attack), and P(L|attack) (which is 1 - P(H|attack)). However, we don't know P(W|L) directly. Instead, we can use the complementary probability: P(E|L) = 1 - P(W|L). Since we know P(E|L), we can solve for P(W|L):

P(W|L) = 1 - P(E|L) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(attack and W):
P(attack and W) = P(W|H) * P(H|attack) + P(W|L) * P(L|attack)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Next, we need to find P(attack and H and W):
P(attack and H and W) = P(W|H) * P(H|attack)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

Now, we can find P(H|attack and witness identification):
P(H|attack and witness identification) = P(attack and H and W) / P(attack and W)
= 0.12 / 0.8
= 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
