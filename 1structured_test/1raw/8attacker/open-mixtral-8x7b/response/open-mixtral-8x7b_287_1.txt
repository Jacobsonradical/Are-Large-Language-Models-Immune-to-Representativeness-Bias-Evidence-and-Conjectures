Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% for this witness and a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller under the assumption that the witness's ability to judge height is accurate and independent of the population distribution.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given that the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, so P(W|A) = 0.8, where W is the event of a correct identification.

However, the witness also erred 20% of the time, so P(W|¬A) = 0.2, where ¬A is the event of an incorrect identification and W is the event of a correct identification.

We also know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and assuming that the witness's ability to judge height is independent of the attacker's height, we can say that the false positive rate is 15% * 0.2 = 3%, and the true positive rate is 80% * 0.8 = 64%.

Therefore, P(A|W) = 64% or 0.64.

{probability: 0.64}
