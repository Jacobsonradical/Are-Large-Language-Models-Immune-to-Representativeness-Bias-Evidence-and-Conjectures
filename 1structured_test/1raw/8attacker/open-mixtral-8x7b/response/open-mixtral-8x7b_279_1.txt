Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
2. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these factors, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= [P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:
P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80% correct identification rate)

Next, we need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can do this by taking into account both the true positive rate (the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness identifies them as such) and the false positive rate (the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the witness identifies them as such):

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)
= [P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller)]

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and over 185 cm and considering the 15% proportion of attackers being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the overall probability:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)
= [0.15 * 0.8] + [0.85 * (1 - 0.2)]
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
