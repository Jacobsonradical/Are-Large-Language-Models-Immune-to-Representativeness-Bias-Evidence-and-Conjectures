Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

1. We know from point a that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller in the general population.
2. However, point b tells us that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, would be the product of the two probabilities: 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 (80%) = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
