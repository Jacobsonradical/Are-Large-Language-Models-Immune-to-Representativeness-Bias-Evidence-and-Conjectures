To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance of error (i.e., the person is actually shorter than 185 cm).

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's combine these two pieces of information. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- not A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.34 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.34 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.2121

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2121.
