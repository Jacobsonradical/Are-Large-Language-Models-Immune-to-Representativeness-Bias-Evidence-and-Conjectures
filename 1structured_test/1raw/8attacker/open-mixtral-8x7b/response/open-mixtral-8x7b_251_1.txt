To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness and the prior probability from the population distribution. We will apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability.

First, let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A) as the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|A') as the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- P(A) = x
- P(A') = 1-x
- P(W|A) = 1 (as the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(W|A') = 0.2 (as the witness erred 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A')]

We have one more piece of information to use here: 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85

Plugging everything in:
P(A|W) = [(1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))]

Now, calculate the value:
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.375

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.375.
