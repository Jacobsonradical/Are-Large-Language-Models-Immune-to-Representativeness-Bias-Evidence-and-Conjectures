To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller. According to statement "a", the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller. According to statement "a", the witness incorrectly identified a person's height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm.

Next, we need to consider the distribution of attackers' heights. According to statement "b", 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identification)

We know that P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from statement "a"), P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from statement "b"), and P(witness identification) can be calculated as:

P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification | under 185 cm) \* P(under 185 cm)

From statement "a", we know that the witness incorrectly identified a person's height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm (from statement "b"), P(witness identification | under 185 cm) = 0.2.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
