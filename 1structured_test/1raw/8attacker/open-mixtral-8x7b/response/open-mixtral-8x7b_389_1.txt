Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the base rate for attackers who are 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that 50% of potential attackers are 185 cm or taller.

However, the witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which introduces a new probability based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height (80%)
- P(A) is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (50%)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's statement, which can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness's statement given the attacker's height (either 185 cm or shorter) weighted by their base rates

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

where:
- P(A') is the base rate of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm (also 50%)
- P(B|A') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter (20%)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(B) = (0.8)*(0.5) + (0.2)*(0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.5) / (0.6) â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.667 or 67%.
