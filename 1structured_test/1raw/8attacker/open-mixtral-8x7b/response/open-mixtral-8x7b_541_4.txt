To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

P(A | B) = 0.8

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the witness's identification, is:

P(A) = 0.15

To find the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B | A) = P(A | B) \* P(B) / P(A)

We don't know P(B), the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller. However, we can find the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B' | A') = P(A' | B') \* P(B') / P(A')

where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and B' is the event that the witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, the witness must be correct 80% of the time when identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm as well, and errs 20% of the time.

P(A' | B') = 0.8

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, regardless of the witness's identification, is:

P(A') = 0.85

Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, we can assume that P(B') = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, is:

P(B' | A') = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.85 ≈ 0.4706

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can find the probability of the witness being incorrect:

P(B' | A) = 1 - P(B | A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where P(B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) + P(B' | A) \* P(A)

P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.15) = 0.13

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(A | B) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.13 ≈ 0.9231

{probability: 0.9231}
