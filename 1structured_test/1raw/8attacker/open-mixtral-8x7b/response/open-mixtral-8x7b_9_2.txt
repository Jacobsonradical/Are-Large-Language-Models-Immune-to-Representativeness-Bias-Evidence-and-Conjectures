Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally divided between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. This means that even though there are many people in the general population who are 185 cm or taller, a smaller percentage of attackers fall into this category.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We need to account for both the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|~A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.2885 or 28.85%

So, given the information provided, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 28.85%.
