Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that shorter individuals are more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

However, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments under the given conditions.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are interested in P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

We know that P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

We also know that P(A) is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the true positive rate (when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such) and the false positive rate (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller).

The true positive rate is P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12.

The false positive rate is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(B|A') or 1 - 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.245.

Since we know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, the probability of selecting an attacker under 185 cm is also 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm). Thus, the probability of selecting a shorter attacker and the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.245 ≈ 0.20825.

Therefore, the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(B), is the sum of the true positive rate and the false positive rate: 0.12 + 0.20825 ≈ 0.32825.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) ≈ (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.32825) ≈ 0.3657

{probability: 0.3657}
