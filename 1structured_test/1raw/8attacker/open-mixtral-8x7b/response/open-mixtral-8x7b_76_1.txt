Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter attackers are more common.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate.

Given these points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here,
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identifying height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.2818

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2818}
