To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our initial belief about the attacker's height based on new information.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given the witness's identification and the distribution of attackers' heights.

According to the problem, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person as such 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and since 50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the overall probability is 0.2 * 0.5)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
