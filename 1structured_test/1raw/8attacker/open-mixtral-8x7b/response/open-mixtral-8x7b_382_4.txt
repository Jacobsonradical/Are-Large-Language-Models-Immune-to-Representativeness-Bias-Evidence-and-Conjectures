To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use the concept of Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(B|not A), we can use the witness's error rate of 20%:
- P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
