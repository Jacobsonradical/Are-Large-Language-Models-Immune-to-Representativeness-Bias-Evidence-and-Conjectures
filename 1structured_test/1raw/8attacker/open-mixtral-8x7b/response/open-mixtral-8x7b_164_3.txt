Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers than taller people.

b. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate. This means there's a 20% chance the witness is mistaken.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, we need to weigh the witness's accuracy against the baseline probability from point a. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the witness's accuracy (0.8), P(A) is the baseline probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), and P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to account for both correct identifications and mistakes:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85]
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, based on the given information, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
