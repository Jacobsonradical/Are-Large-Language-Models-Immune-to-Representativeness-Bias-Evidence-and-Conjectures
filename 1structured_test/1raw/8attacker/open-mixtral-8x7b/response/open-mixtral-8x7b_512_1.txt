Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of them are by people under 185 cm. This means that even though the population is evenly split, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm.

But there's another piece of information: a specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This witness is correct 80% of the time when judging a person's height under similar conditions.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

What we want is P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given data, we have:
- P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is evenly split)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
