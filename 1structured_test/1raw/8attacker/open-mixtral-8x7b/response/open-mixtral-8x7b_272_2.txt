To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:

* A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|C) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

P(B|C') = 0.2 (witness erroneously identified the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is not actually 185 cm or taller)

P(C') = 0.85 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(C) = 0.15 (thus, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(C|B), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) \* P(C) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), which is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|C) \* P(C) + P(B|C') \* P(C')

Now, we can calculate P(C|B):

P(C|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))
P(C|B) â‰ˆ 0.2817

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2817 or 28.17%.
