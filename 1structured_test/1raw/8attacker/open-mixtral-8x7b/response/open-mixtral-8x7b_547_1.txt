Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's identification.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we should consider the reliability of the witness. The witness is correct 80% of the time, so there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.8}
