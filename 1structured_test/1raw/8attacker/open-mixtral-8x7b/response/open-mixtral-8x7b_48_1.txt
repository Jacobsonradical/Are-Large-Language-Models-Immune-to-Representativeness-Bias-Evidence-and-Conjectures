Based on the information provided, let's reason through this:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, the attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85%).
b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these facts, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to consider both the prior probability (from point a) and the likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker's height (from point b).

The prior probability (P(A)) is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to point a.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker's height (P(W|A)) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

The probability we want to find is P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)]

We know P(W|A) and P(A), but we don't know P(W|~A) and P(~A). However, given that the witness is equally likely to make an error in both directions, P(W|~A) is also 20%.

P(~A) is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85% according to point a.

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.4138 (approximately)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (when expressed as a percentage, this would be about 41.4%).
