To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) and the observed data (B). 

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. For the latter, the probability of the observed data is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time). The overall probability of the observed data is the weighted sum of these two probabilities, i.e., P(B) = 0.2*0.15 + 0.8*0.85 = 0.685

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8*0.5) / 0.685 â‰ˆ 0.609

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.609.
