Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that shorter people may be more aggressive or involved in attacks.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness has identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know the witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases. Therefore, using Bayes' theorem, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population
- P(B) is the probability of the witness's statement, which is a combination of the witness correctly identifying taller people and incorrectly identifying shorter people as being 185 cm or taller

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + ((1-0.8) * (1-0.15))
= 0.12 + 0.36
= 0.48

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.48
= 0.12 / 0.48
= 0.25

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.25.
