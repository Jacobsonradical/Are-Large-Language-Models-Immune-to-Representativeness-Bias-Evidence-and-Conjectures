The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated by applying Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
From statement (b), we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time), and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, when they are not).

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.375

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
