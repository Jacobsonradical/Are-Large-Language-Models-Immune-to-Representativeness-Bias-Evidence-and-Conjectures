To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume a 50-50 chance for a person to be in either group. Thus, if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, the probability can be calculated as:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

Now let's denote:
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) as p
- P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) as 0.8 (witness accuracy)
- P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) as 0.5 (50-50 chance of being in either group)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

0.8 * p / 0.5 = p

Solving for p, we get p = 0.625.

However, we have another piece of information to refine our estimate. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the witness's identification is not accurate for the overall population but is accurate for the subset of attackers. Thus, we need to adjust our calculation based on the distribution of attackers' heights:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We already know that P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 and P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (15% chance for a randomly selected attacker to be 185 cm or taller). Now we need to calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller):

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is in the subset) * P(attacker is in the subset) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is not in the subset) * P(attacker is not in the subset)

We know that P(attacker is in the subset) = 0.15 and P(attacker is not in the subset) = 0.85. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the attacker is indeed in the subset of people who are 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 * 0.15 + 0 * 0.85 = 0.15

Now we can substitute these values into the original formula:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.15 = 0.8

Therefore, given the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
