Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly, which is given as 80%. We also know that there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. 

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply these two probabilities together:

0.15 (probability of being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability of correct identification) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
