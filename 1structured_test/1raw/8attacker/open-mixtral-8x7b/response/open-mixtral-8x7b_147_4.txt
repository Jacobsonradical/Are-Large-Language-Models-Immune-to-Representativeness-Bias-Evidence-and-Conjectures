To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identified people of a certain height or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, this statement alone doesn't provide enough information about the attacker's height as the witness could have mistakenly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller.

Statement "b" tells us that, in general, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a clue about the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller by taking into account both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy rate from statement "a", there is an 80% chance that this identification is correct. However, we must also account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller, as stated in "b". Therefore, we need to multiply these probabilities to get the final estimate.

The formula would look like this: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population)

Plugging in the numbers:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
