Given the information in (a), even though the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to be attackers in this scenario.

However, we have a witness statement (b) that the attacker was at or above 185 cm, with the court assessing the witness as having 80% accuracy in judging height and 20% error rate.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(not B|A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of cases where attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of cases where attacker is under 185 cm, and this results in falsely identifying them as 185 cm or taller)
P(not B|not A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when attacker is under 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
