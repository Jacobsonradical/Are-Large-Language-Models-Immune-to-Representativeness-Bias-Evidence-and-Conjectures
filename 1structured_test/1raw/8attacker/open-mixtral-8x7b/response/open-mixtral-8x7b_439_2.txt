Let's break down the given information:

a. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

b. Out of such attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height and the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height:
Probability of correct identification = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)

Next, let's determine the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller:
Proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (given in the problem)

Finally, we can calculate the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
Estimated probability = Probability of correct identification * Proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
