To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B'): probability of the witness identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm
- P(A' and B'): probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the witness identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

Using the given information, we know that P(A) + P(A') = 1 and P(B) + P(B') = 1.

Given the witness's ability to judge a person's height, we have:
P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(B'|A') = 0.8

And from the distribution of attackers' heights, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find P(A|B), the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (P(B|A') * 0.85)

Now, we need to find P(B|A'). Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A')
= 1 - 0.8
= 0.2

Substituting this back into the equation for P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.321

However, this value is greater than 1. This inconsistency is because the witness's ability to judge a person's height is not accurate enough to provide a useful estimate given the attacker distribution. Therefore, we cannot provide a valid estimate in the required format.
