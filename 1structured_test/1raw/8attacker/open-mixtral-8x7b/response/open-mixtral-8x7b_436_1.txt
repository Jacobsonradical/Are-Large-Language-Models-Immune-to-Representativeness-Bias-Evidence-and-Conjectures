To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now we need to find P(B). To do this, let's consider two mutually exclusive cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

- P(B and A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller: P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
- P(B and not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not: P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
