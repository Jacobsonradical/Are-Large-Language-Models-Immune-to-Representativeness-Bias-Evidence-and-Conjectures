Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:

P(tall | witness) = 0.80

However, this probability is not the final answer we're looking for, because we also need to consider the base rates of attackers being 185 cm or taller, which is provided in section (b). We can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(tall) = P(witness | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness)

We're given P(witness | tall) = 0.80, and from (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(tall) = 0.15. We need to determine P(witness), which we can do using the law of total probability:

P(witness) = P(witness | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness | short) * P(short)

From (a), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so P(witness | short) = 0.20. Also, since 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, P(short) = 0.85. So:

P(witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.120 + 0.170 = 0.290

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(tall) = P(witness | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.290 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
