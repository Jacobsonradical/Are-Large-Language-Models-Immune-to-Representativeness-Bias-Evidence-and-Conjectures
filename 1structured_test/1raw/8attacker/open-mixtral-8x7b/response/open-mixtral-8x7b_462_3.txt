Based on the information provided, let's denote:

A = The event that a randomly chosen person from the population is shorter than 185 cm.
B = The event that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller.
W = The event that the witness correctly identifies a person's height.
~W = The event that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height.

From the given data, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size for both heights)
P(attacker is under 185 cm | attacker is of any height) = 0.85
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is of any height) = 0.15
P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(~W|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(B|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(B|W) = [P(W|B) * P(B)] / [P(W|B) * P(B) + P(W|A) * P(A)]

Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we have P(W|A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time) and P(W|B) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B|W) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(B|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(B|W) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(B|W) = 0.888888889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.888888889}
