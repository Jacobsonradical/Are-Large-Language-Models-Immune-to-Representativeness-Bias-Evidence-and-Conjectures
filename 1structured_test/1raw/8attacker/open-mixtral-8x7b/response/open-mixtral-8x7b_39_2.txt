To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B' | A'): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually shorter than 1
