Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80% or 0.8. Let's denote this probability as P(C|T), where C is the event of correct identification and T represents the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

Next, we need to consider the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not that tall, which is given as 20%, or 0.2. Let's denote this probability as P(C|S), where S represents the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. Thus, P(T) = P(S) = 0.5.

To estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we need to calculate P(T|C). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|C) = [P(C|T) * P(T)] / [P(C|T) * P(T) + P(C|S) * P(S)]

Plug in the values:

P(T|C) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(T|C) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(T|C) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(T|C) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
