Let's break down the given information:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This means the false positive rate is 0.2 and the true positive rate is 0.8.

b) Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are under 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the true positive rate, 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to find the sum of probabilities of two scenarios:
1) The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
2) The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Thus, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
