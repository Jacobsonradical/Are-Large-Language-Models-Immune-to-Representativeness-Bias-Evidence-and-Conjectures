Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions is 80% accurate with a 20% error rate.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and W represent the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller." We want P(A|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We are given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
- P(A) ≈ 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(¬A) ≈ 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually 185 cm or taller and when they are not:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

Plugging in the given values:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Now, we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 ≈ 0.093 / 0.41 ≈ 0.227 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.227}
