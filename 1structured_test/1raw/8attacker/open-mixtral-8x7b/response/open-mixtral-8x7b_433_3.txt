To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that the witness's error rate is symmetric, meaning that they are equally likely to incorrectly label someone as shorter than 185 cm as they are to incorrectly label someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the witness's error rate for identifying someone as 185 cm or taller is 10% (half of 20%).

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and not A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 10% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)
= 0.12 / 0.205
= 0.585

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.585.
