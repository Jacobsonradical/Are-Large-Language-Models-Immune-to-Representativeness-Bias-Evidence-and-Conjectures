To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the witness's statement increases the likelihood that the person is 185 cm or taller by a factor of 80/20 = 4, and decreases the likelihood that the person is shorter than 185 cm by a factor of 20/80 = 0.25.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the likelihood of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can multiply the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the person is 185 cm or taller by the likelihood of the person being 185 cm or taller. Similarly, we can multiply the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the person is shorter than 185 cm by the likelihood of the person being shorter than 185 cm. We can then divide these two products to get the ratio of the likelihood of the person being 185 cm or taller to the likelihood of the person being shorter than 185 cm.

The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the person is 185 cm or taller is 80%, or 0.8. The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the person is shorter than 185 cm is 20%, or 0.2. The likelihood of the person being 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15. The likelihood of the person being shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.

Therefore, the ratio of the likelihood of the person being 185 cm or taller to the likelihood of the person being shorter than 185 cm is:

(0.8 * 0.15) / (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.17 = 0.7059...

To convert this ratio to a probability, we can divide the numerator by the sum of the numerator and the denominator:

probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4137931...

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
