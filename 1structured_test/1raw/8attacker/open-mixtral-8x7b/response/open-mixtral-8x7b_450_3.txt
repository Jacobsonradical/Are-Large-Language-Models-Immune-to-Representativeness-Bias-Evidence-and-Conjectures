Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate.

Given these points, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's calculate the probability:

1. The probability of the witness being correct when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
2. Since there are equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, we can assume that the witness's error rate is symmetric, meaning there is a 0.2 chance (20%) of mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.

To find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
- P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.375

{probability: 0.375}
