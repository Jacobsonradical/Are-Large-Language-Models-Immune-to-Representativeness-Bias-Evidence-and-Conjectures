Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being roughly equal in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a success rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to consider both the prevalence of tall attackers and the accuracy of the witness.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, let A represent the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and B represent the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall attackers 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short attackers as tall 20% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
