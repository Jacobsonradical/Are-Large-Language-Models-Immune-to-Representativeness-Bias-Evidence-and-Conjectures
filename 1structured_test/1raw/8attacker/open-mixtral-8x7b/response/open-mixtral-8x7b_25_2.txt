To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.

From part (a), we have that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. We can treat this as a binary classification problem with a biased coin. The probability of the witness saying "185 cm or taller" is P(taller | witness says taller) = 0.8 and the probability of the witness saying "shorter" is P(shorter | witness says shorter) = 0.8. By Bayes' theorem, we can find:

P(witness says taller | taller) = P(taller) * P(witness says taller | taller) / P(witness says taller)
= P(taller) * 0.8 / (P(taller) * 0.8 + P(shorter) * 0.2)
= 0.8P(taller) / (0.8P(taller) + 0.2(1-P(taller)))

Since we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller from part (b), we can set P(taller) = 0.15 and solve for P(witness says taller | taller):

P(witness says taller | taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17) = 0.36

This means there is a 36% chance that the witness would say "185 cm or taller" if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

However, given the additional information in part (b) that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, we have to account for this prior probability.

P(shorter) = 0.85
P(taller) = 0.15

We can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement as:

P(taller | witness says taller) = P(witness says taller | taller) * P(taller) / P(witness says taller)
= 0.36 * 0.15 / (0.36 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.85) * 0.36)
= 0.054 / (0.054 + 0.066)
= 0.45

So the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 45%.
