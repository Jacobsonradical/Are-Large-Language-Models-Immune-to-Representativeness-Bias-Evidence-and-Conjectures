To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (and errs 20% of the time).
2. Among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

Let P(Tall) be the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
Let P(Witness|Tall) be the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
Let P(Witness|Short) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a", P(Witness|Tall) = 0.8 and P(Witness|Short) = 0.2.
From statement "b", P(Tall) = 0.15.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(Tall|Witness):
P(Tall|Witness) = P(Witness|Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness)

We can calculate P(Witness) as follows:
P(Witness) = P(Witness|Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness|Short) * P(Short)

Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, P(Short) = 0.5.

Substituting the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Tall|Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5))
P(Tall|Witness) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
