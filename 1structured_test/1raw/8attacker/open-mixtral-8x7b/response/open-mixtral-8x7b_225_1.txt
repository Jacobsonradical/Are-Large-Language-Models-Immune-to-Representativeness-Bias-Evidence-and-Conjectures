Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people, contrary to the general population distribution.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their judgement was assessed to be correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness is correct 20% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B), which can be decomposed as:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Now, we don't have information about P(B|A') directly, but we can rewrite it using the witness's error rate:
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.8) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8) = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
