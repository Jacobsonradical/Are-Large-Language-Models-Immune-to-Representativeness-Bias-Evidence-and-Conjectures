Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such, which is given as 80%. We also know that there's a 15% probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. This is a case of posterior probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A represents the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B represents the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller).

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for each case:
- P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
- P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.345}
