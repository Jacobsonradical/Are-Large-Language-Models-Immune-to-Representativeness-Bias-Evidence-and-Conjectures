To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness identified a person as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the witness erred in their judgment.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80%)
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (which is 15%)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (which we need to calculate)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80%)
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (which is 15%)
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 100% - 85% = 15%, since the witness would identify a person as 185 cm or taller if they are actually under 185 cm)
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (which is 85%)

Putting it all together, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.15 \* 0.85)) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.1275) = 0.12 / 0.2475 â‰ˆ 0.485

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.485.
