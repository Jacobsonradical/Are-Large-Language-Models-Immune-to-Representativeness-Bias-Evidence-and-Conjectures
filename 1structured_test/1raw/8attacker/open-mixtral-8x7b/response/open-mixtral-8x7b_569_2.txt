To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From (a), we know that the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which means P(B|A) = 0.8.

From (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to calculate P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15.

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

From (b), 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, so P(not A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.345}
