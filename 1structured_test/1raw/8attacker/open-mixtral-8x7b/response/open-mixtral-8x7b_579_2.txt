To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.8 (80%).

However, we also need to consider the distribution of attackers' heights in the population. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41.
