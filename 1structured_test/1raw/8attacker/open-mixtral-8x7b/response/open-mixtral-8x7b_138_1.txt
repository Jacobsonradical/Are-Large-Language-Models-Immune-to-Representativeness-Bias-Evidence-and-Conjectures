Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population: 50% are under 185 cm, and 50% are 185 cm or taller. However, the witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this, we can calculate the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, as follows:

P(Correct identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Now, let's consider the complementary probability, which is the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually not that tall:

P(Incorrect identification | Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.2

Now, we need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

To estimate the final probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller), we need to account for both cases: when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and when they are not:

P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is under 185 cm) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm)

= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the final probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931

However, since we are asked for an estimate in a strict format, we will round the answer to three decimal places:

{probability: 0.414}
