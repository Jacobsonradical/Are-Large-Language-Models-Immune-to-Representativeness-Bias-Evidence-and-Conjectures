To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in "a" and "b" to calculate the probabilities independently, and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

From "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is:

P(tall | witness) = 0.8

From "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

P(tall) = 0.15

We also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is:

P(short) = 0.85

From "b", we also know that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness identified the attacker as such, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct:

P(witness | tall) = 0.8

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(tall | witness) = P(witness | tall) \* P(tall) / P(witness)

To calculate P(witness), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness) = P(witness | tall) \* P(tall) + P(witness | short) \* P(short)

We can calculate P(witness | short) using the complement of the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:

P(witness | short) = 1 - P(witness | tall) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(tall | witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
