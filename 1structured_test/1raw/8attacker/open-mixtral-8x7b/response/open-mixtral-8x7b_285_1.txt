Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which is given as 80% or 0.8. 

However, we also need to consider the error rate, which is given as 20% or 0.2. This means that there's a chance that the witness could have incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, we can assume a 50% or 0.5 prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know P(B|A) is the correct identification rate of 0.8, and P(A) is the prior probability of 0.5. We need to find P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the product of the correct identification rate and the probability of the corresponding group (A or not A), plus the product of the error rate and the probability of the corresponding group.

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
     = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
     = 0.6 + 0.1
     = 0.7

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.7
       = 0.4 / 0.7
       = 0.5714 (approximately)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.5714}.
