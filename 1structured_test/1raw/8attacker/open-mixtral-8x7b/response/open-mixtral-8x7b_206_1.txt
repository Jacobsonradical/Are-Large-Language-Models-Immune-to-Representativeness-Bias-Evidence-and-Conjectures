Given the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge height under similar conditions was assessed. They are correct 80% of the time and mistaken 20% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability:

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given their assessment rate, there's an 80% chance they're correct. Therefore:

{probability: 0.8}
