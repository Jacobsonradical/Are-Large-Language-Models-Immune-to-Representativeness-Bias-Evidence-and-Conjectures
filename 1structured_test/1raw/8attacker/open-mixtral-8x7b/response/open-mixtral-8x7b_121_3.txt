Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter attackers are more common.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A (attacker being 185 cm or taller) given event B (witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A, which is the witness's correct identification rate of 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A, which is the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller, or 15%.
- P(B) is the probability of event B, which is the combined probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker and incorrectly identifying a short attacker.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A), P(A), and P(not A) (which is 85% since there's a roughly equal distribution of people below and above 185 cm). To find P(B|not A), we can use the witness's error rate of 20% for short attackers:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A)
= 1 - error rate
= 1 - 0.20
= 0.80

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.80 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.80

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.80
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
