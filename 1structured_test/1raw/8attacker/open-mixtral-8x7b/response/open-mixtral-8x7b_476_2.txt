Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

a. We know that the population has roughly an equal number of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers despite making up half of the population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since half the population is below 185 cm and half is 185 cm or taller, we are given that P(T) = 0.5.

We are told that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 (given P(T) = 0.5).

However, we must also consider the possibility that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (given P(T) = 0.5), as the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

To find the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T)]

We are given P(W|T) = 0.8, P(W|not T) = 0.2, P(T) = 0.5, and P(not T) = 0.5.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
