To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs given evidence.

Let's define:
- P(A) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is roughly 0.5 according to the information given.
- P(B) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the information given.
- P(B|A) as the probability of choosing an attacker who is 185 cm or taller given that we know the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 1.
- P(A|B) as the probability that a person chosen at random is 185 cm or taller given that we know the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is what we want to find out.
- P(not A) and P(not B) are the probabilities of choosing a person or attacker who is shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We are given P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the false positive rate of the witness), P(not A) = 0.5 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm), and P(B) = 0.15.

We want to find P(A|B), so we need to compute the denominator first:

P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 1 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5
= 0.5 + 0.1
= 0.6

Now we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (1 * 0.5) / 0.6
= 0.5 / 0.6
= 0.8333

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8333 or 83.33%.
