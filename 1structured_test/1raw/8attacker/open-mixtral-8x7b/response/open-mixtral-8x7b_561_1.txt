To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given data, we have:
P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify him as such)
P(B|¬A) = P(witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are NOT 185 cm or taller)

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting our values:
P(A|B) = [1 * 0.15] / [(1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.375

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
