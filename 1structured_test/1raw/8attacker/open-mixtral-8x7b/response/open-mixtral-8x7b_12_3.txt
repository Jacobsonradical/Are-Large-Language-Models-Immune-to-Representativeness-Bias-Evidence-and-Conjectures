Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
P(A) = Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller
P(B) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
P(~B) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller

From (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
From (b), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, so P(B) = 0.8.
And since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(~B) = 0.2.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the person is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 1, since if the person is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them correctly.

So, P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.1875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1875}
