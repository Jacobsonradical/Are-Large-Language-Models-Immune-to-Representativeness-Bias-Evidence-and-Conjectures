Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population: half the people are shorter than 185 cm and half are 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is a problem of conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate it.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

Next, let's calculate P(A): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that half the population is in this category. So, P(A) = 0.5.

Lastly, we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the witness identifying anyone as 185 cm or taller. This will be a weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller both when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (which happens 20% of the time, when the witness errs) and when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (which happens 80% of the time, when the witness is correct).

The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.5 (the prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm) times 0.2 (the witness's error rate), which equals 0.1.

The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller) times 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), which equals 0.4.

So, P(B) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
