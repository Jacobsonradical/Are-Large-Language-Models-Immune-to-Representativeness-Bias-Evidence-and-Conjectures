Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This means that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, but there are just as many tall people as there are short people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments under these conditions.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.5) + [P(B|not A) * 0.5]

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the error rate of 20%:

P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.667 or 67%.
