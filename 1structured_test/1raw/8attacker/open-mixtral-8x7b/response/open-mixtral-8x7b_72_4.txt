Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the witness being correct 80% of the time in such judgments.

Given these pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we are given P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are also given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, which means P(A) = 0.15.

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and there are roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, we can infer that P(B|¬A) = 0.75, the probability that the witness identifies a person who is NOT 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can apply the law of total probability to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.75 * 0.85) ≈ 0.795

Finally, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) ≈ [(0.8 * 0.15) / 0.795] ≈ 0.1925

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.1925}
