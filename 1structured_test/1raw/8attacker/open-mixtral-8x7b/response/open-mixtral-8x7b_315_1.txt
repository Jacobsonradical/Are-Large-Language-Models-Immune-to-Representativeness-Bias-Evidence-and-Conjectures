To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate the probability:

Let H be the event of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
Let W be the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We are given P(W|H) = 0.8 (from statement "a"), P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, from statement "b"), and we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(W), we consider two cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H) = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(W|not H) * 0.85

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W|not H), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Without this information, we cannot provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given the available information, I cannot strictly answer the question in the requested format. However, I can provide a range for the estimate based on the witness's accuracy when identifying people as 185 cm or taller. The probability would be between 0.15 (if the witness is always correct) and 0.42 (if the witness is never correct when identifying shorter people as 185 cm or taller).
