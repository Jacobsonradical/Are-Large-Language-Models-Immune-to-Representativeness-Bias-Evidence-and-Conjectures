To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are. Based on the given information, the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

Next, let's find the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can multiply these two probabilities together to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

0.8 (witness correctly identifies an 185+ cm attacker) Ã— 0.15 (fraction of attackers who are 185+ cm) = 0.12 or 12%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
