Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(falsely identifies as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and at/above 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of a person being at/above 185 cm as:

P(at/above 185 cm) = 0.5

Since the witness identified the attacker as being at/above 185 cm, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability as:

P(attacker's height is at/above 185 cm) = P(correctly identifies 185 cm or taller) * P(at/above 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.5
= 0.4

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4}
