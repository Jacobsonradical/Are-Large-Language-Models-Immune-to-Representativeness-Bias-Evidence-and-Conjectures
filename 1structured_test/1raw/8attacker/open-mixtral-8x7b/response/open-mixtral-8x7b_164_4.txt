Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(correct identification) = 0.80
P(incorrect identification) = 0.20

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume a 50-50 chance of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller or not.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. This is a conditional probability and can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of correct identification)
P(A) = 0.50 (50-50 chance of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness. Since the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.20, and given that 50% of the population is not 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
         = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50)
         = 0.60

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
           = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.60
           = 0.67 (approximately)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.67}
