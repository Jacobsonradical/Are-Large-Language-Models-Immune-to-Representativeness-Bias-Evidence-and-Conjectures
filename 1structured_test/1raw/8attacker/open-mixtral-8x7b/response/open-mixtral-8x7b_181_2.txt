Given the information, let's break down the problem into two parts:

1. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. This means that the distribution of heights is relatively even on both sides of 185 cm.

2. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which happens correctly 80% of the time. Therefore, given the conditions, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
