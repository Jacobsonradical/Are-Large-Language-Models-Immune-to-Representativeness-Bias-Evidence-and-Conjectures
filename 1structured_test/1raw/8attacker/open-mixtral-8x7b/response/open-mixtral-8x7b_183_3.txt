Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so the probability of them correctly identifying an attacker of this height is 0.8. Likewise, they incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so the probability of them making this error is 0.2.

We are given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, and that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the witness's statement is correct, given that the person was indeed attacked by someone 185 cm or taller, can be calculated as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller)
= P(witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
