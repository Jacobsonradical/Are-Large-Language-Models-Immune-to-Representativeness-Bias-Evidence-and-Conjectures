Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correct ID) = 0.80
P(Incorrect ID) = 0.20

Given that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, we can say that:

P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.50
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.50

We are told that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller)

The denominator can be calculated as:
P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

We are given P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.80
P(Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.20 (since the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Substituting these values in the above equation:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.80 * 0.50] / [(0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50)]
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified as 185 cm or taller) ≈ 0.80

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.80}
