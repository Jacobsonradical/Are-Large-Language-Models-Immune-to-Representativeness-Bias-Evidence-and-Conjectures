To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the general population distribution and the witness's ability to judge height.

Let's denote:
- P(U) as the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm
- P(O) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|O) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(W|U) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information:
P(U) = P(O) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal)
P(W|O) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
P(W|U) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

We want to find P(O|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such. We can use Bayes' theorem to compute this probability:

P(O|W) = [P(W|O) * P(O)] / [P(W|O) * P(O) + P(W|U) * P(U)]

Substituting the values,
P(O|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
