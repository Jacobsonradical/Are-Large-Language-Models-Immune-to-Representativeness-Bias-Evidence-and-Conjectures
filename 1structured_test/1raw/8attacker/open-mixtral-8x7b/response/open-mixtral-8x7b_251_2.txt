To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): Probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we can compute P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred and identified a person as 185 cm or taller when they were not, 20% of the time).

We are also given that P(A) is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(not A) is 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substitute the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375 (37.5%).
