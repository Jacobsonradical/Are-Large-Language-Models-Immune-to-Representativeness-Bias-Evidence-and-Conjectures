To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar situations.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information, the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height, so P(B|C) = 0.8. The probability of the witness saying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether or not they actually were, is denoted as P(B).

Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(C) = 0.15. Similarly, since 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, P(C') = 0.85.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate P(C|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

We can calculate P(B) as follows:
P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|C') * P(C')
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.18 + 0.765
     = 0.945

Now, we can find P(C|B):
P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)
      = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.945
      â‰ˆ 0.1217

However, this value represents the probability that the witness is correct, given that they identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are interested in the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. Since the witness was correct in 80% of the cases, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.09736, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
