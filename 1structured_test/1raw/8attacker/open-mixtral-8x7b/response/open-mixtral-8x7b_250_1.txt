Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from point b)

And the probability of a witness misidentifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (100% - 80% from point b)

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under and at/above 185 cm, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being at/above 185 cm as:

P(actual 185 cm or taller) = P(actual 185 cm or taller and witness identifies 185 cm or taller) + P(actual shorter than 185 cm and witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

P(actual 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual 185 cm or taller) * P(actual 185 cm or taller) + P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual shorter than 185 cm) * P(actual shorter than 185 cm)

Let's call P(actual 185 cm or taller) as 'p'. Then,

p = 0.8 * p + 0.2 * (1-p)
p = 0.2 + 0.18 * p
0.82 * p = 0.2
p = 0.243902439 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.244}
