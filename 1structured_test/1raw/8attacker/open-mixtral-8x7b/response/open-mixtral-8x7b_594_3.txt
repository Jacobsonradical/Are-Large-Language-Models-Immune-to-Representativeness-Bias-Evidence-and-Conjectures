Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, the proportion of attackers in these two groups is not equal, with 85% of attackers being under 185 cm and only 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Substituting in the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

Simplifying and calculating, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
