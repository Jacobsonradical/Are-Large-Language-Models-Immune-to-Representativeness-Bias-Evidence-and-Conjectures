To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. According to the witness's ability to judge a person's height, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify this 80% of the time (0.8 probability).

Next, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller regardless of the witness's identification. According to the distribution of attackers' heights, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we need to combine these probabilities to estimate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. We can do this using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability we want to find (the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8)
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm and when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
