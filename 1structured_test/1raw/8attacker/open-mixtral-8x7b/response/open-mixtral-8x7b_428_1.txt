To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, then 80% of the time, this is correct, and 20% of the time, this is an error.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we use the witness's accuracy rate of 80%.

To find P(A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we use the distribution of attacker heights, which is 15%.

To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two cases:

1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with probability 80%.
2. The attacker's height is under 185 cm, and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with probability 20%.

Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, we can estimate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.41

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
