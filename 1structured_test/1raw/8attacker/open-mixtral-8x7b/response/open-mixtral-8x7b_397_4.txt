To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

Given these pieces of information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W), we need to consider two cases: the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (W and H are true) and the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (W is true, but H is false).

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)

We are given:
P(W and H) = P(W|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(W and not H) = P(W|not H) * P(not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
