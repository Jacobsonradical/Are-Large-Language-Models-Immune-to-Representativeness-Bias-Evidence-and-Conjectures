Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This means that shorter people are both more common and more likely to be attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that a person is an attacker (either below or above 185 cm)
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8)
P(B|not A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a non-attacker as 185 cm or taller (20% or 0.2)
P(not A) as the probability that a person is not an attacker (equal to P(A))

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(B|A) and P(B|not A), and since the population is roughly equal in size below and above 185 cm, P(A) = P(not A). Thus, P(A) = 0.5.

Substituting these values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
