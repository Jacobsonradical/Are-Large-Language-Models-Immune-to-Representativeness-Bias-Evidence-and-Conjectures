To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

We are given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

First, we need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually not that tall. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs and identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, let's find P(not A), the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.52}
