Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers in this population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height was assessed. The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find P(tall | witness report), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness report.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(tall | witness report) = [P(witness report | tall) * P(tall)] / P(witness report)

We know:
- P(witness report | tall) = 0.8 (witness accuracy in identifying tall people)
- P(tall) = 0.15 (proportion of tall attackers)

To calculate P(witness report), we need to consider two scenarios: the witness correctly identified a tall attacker and the witness incorrectly identified a short attacker as tall.

P(witness report) = P(witness report | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness report | not tall) * P(not tall)

We already know:
- P(witness report | tall) = 0.8
- P(tall) = 0.15

We also know:
- P(witness report | not tall) = 0.2 (witness error rate in identifying short people)
- P(not tall) = 0.85 (proportion of short attackers)

Substituting these values, we can calculate P(witness report):

P(witness report) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(tall | witness report):

P(tall | witness report) = [P(witness report | tall) * P(tall)] / P(witness report)
P(tall | witness report) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
