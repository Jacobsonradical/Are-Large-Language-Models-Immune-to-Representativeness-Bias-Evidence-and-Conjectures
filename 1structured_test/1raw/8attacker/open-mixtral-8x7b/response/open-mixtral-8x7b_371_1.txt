Based on the information provided, let's break this down:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height and only 15% are above. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

b. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under these conditions is 80% accurate. This means there's a 20% chance they could be mistaken.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. 

We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when they identify someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, given that they identified the attacker as such, we can estimate the probability as follows:

Probability = Percentage of times the witness is correct
= 0.80, or 80%

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.80}
