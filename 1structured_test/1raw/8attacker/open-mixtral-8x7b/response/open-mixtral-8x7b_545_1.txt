Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm):

P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

Now, given that the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, and the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = P(identified as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller)] / [P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller) + P(identified as 185 cm or taller | actually shorter than 185 cm) * P(actually shorter than 185 cm)]

Given the information, we can assume that P(actually 185 cm or taller) = P(actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 (equal populations). Therefore:

P(actually 185 cm or taller) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
