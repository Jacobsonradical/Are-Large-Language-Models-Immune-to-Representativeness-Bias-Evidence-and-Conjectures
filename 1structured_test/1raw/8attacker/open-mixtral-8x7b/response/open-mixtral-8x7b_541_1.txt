To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can now calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):

P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)] ≈ 0.3158

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3158 (or 31.58%).
