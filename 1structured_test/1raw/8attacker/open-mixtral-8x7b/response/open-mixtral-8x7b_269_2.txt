To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let's define:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in judgment 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find:
P(A|B) = probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, calculate P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17)] = 0.3158 or approximately 31.58%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.3158}
