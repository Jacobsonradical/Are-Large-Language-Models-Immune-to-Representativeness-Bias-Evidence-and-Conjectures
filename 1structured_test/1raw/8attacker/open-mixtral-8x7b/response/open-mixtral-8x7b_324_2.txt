To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. However, this also means that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

We can combine these two pieces of information to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's ability to judge height, there is an 80% chance that this identification is correct. However, we also need to take into account the distribution of attackers' heights. Since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, there is only a 12% chance (0.8 x 0.15) that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
