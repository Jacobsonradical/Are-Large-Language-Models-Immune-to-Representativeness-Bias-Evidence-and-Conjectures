To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are:

A: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
B: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as such.

From the given data, we have:

1. P(A|B) = 0.80, the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
2. P(A|not B) = 0.20, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not.
3. P(B) = 0.15, the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. P(not B) = 0.85, the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / [P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B|A) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(B|A) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(B|A) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(B|A) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
