To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two statements to calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.

From statement a, we know that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such is:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = 0.8

From statement b, we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(tall) = 0.15

However, we don't know the probability that the witness identifies a tall attacker as such. To find this probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) \* P(tall) / P(witness identifies tall)

We can find P(witness identifies tall) by summing over all possible heights:

P(witness identifies tall) = P(witness identifies tall | tall) \* P(tall) + P(witness identifies tall | short) \* P(short)

From statement a, we know that the witness identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time. Therefore, we can calculate P(witness identifies tall) as:

P(witness identifies tall) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (1 - 0.15) = 0.18 + 0.16 = 0.34

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(tall | witness identifies tall):

P(tall | witness identifies tall) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.34) = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
