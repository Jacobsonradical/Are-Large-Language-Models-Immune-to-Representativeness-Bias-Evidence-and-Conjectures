To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, using Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness = Taller) = P(Witness = Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness = Taller)

From statement (a), we know that P(Witness = Taller | Taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a taller person as taller 80% of the time) and P(Witness = Taller | Shorter) = 0.2 (witness mistakenly identifies a shorter person as taller 20% of the time). Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and above 185 cm (statement b), we can assume that P(Taller) = P(Shorter) = 0.5.

Now, we need to calculate P(Witness = Taller), which can be calculated as:

P(Witness = Taller) = P(Witness = Taller | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness = Taller | Shorter) * P(Shorter)
= (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)
= 0.6

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Taller | Witness = Taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
