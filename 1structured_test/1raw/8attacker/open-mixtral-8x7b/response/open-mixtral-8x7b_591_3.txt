To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate)

Next, we need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to the information provided. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We already have the first term (0.8) from the witness's correct identification rate. The second term is 0.15 (the base rate). The third term can be calculated as follows:

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.18 + 0.17
= 0.35

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 = 0.24 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.6857

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.6857}
