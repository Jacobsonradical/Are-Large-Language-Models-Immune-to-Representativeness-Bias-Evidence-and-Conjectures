Based on the information provided, there are two pieces of data that can help us estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, we know that the population of people is roughly evenly split between those who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. However, we also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to be attackers than taller people, despite the fact that there are equally many of each.

Second, we know that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and that this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs about the probability of an event (in this case, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring, given that event B has occurred
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring, given that event A has occurred
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A occurring
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B occurring

In this case, we can let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

To use Bayes' theorem, we need to find the following probabilities:

- P(B|A): the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. We are told that the witness is correct 80% of the time in such judgments, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We are told that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B): the prior probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this probability, we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85), and P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not actually that tall. Since the witness is only correct 20% of the time in such cases, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Plugging these values in, we get: P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.14 + 0.17 = 0.31.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.31) = 0.12 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.387.
