Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The general population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions has been assessed. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing a person's height and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as the product of the probability the witness is correct and the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller:

Probability = Witness accuracy * Base rate
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
