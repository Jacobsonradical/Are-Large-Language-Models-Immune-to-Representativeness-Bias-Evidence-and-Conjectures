Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the assessment is correct and a 20% chance that it's an error.

We also know that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, the scenario given is not a random sampling of the population but rather a situation where the witness has identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given this, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.80 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
