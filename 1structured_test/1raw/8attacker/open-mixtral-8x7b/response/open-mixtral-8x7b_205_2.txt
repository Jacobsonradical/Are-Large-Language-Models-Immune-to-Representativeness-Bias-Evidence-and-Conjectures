Given the information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From statement (a), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability P(A) is 0.15.

From statement (b), we know that the witness is correct 80% of the time when judging a person's height. So, the conditional probability P(B|A) is 0.8, which means the witness correctly identifies attackers as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.

However, the witness is also wrong 20% of the time when judging a person's height. Since half the population is shorter and half is taller than 185 cm, this means that the conditional probability P(B|¬A) is 0.5 (20% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, and since half the population is shorter, this is equivalent to the witness correctly identifying a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) using Bayes' rule:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting our values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.5 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.168

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 17%.
