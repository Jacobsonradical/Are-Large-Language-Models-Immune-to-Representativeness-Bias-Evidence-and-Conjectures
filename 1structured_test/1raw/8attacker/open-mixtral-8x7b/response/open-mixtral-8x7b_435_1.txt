Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185cm or taller | actually 185cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is not 185 cm or taller:

P(identified as 185cm or taller | actually shorter than 185cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate)

We also know that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at/above 185 cm, so:

P(actually 185cm or taller) = 0.5
P(actually shorter than 185cm) = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness' identification:

P(actually 185cm or taller | identified as 185cm or taller) = [P(identified as 185cm or taller | actually 185cm or taller)] * [P(actually 185cm or taller)] / [P(identified as 185cm or taller)]

We can calculate P(identified as 185cm or taller) using the law of total probability:

P(identified as 185cm or taller) = P(identified as 185cm or taller | actually 185cm or taller) * P(actually 185cm or taller) + P(identified as 185cm or taller | actually shorter than 185cm) * P(actually shorter than 185cm)

Plugging in the values:

P(identified as 185cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness' identification:

P(actually 185cm or taller | identified as 185cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.667}
