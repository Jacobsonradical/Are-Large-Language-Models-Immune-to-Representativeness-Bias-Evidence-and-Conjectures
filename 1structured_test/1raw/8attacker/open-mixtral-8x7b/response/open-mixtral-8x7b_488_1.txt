Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, in attacks, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which is not proportional to the general population. This suggests that being 185 cm or taller may be a factor that increases the likelihood of someone being an attacker.

Now, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making such a judgement. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8, or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
