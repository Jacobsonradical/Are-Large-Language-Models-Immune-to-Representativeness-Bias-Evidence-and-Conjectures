Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80%. 

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 20%.

Given that the population is roughly equal in size for those under and over 185 cm, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, it would seem that it is more probable that the attacker was under 185 cm. However, we have a witness statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we cannot ignore.

The key here is to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statement. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of A given W.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

From the problem, we are given P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller), and P(W|A') = 0.2 (the probability of incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, where A' represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller).

We are also given that 85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller, so P(A') = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability, which states that P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(A').

Substituting the given values, we get P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414.

So, based on the given information, there is approximately a 41.4% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
