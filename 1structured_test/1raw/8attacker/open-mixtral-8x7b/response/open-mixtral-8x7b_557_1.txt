Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed that tall and a 20% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given that the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, it seems that attackers are more likely to be shorter. However, this information doesn't affect the witness's identification, so we can only consider the witness's accuracy rate.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}
