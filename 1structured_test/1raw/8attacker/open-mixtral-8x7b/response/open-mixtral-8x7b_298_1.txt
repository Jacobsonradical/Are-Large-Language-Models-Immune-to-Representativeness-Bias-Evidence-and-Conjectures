To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

We know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's 80% accuracy, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (which is 80%)
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 15%)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (which can be calculated as the sum of P(B|A)*P(A) and P(B|not A)*P(not A), where P(not A) is 85% and P(B|not A) is the false positive rate of the witness when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.2273

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2273.
