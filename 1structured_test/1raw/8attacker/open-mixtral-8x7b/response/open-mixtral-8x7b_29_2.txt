Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are above it. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, contrary to the witness's statement.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can do this by taking into account both the base rate of such attackers (15%) and the accuracy of the witness (80%).

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness makes a correct identification)
- P(A) is the base rate of A (the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the overall probability of the witness making a correct identification)

We are given P(A) (15%) and P(B|A) (80%). To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the true positives (correct identifications of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) and the false positives (incorrect identifications of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) (80%), P(A) (15%), and the base rate of not A (85%). However, we don't have information about P(B|not A), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. To estimate this, let's assume the witness is unbiased and makes errors at random. In this case, we can estimate P(B|not A) as the overall error rate of the witness:

P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 80% = 20%

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 80% * 15% + 20% * 85% = 12% + 17% = 29%

Finally, we can calculate the probability of A given B using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (80% * 15%) / 29% = 0.2414 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.832 or 83.2%

Therefore, given the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 83.2%.
