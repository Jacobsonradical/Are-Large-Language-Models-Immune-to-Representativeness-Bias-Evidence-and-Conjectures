To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs and identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not. So, when the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can combine these two pieces of information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(185+ | Witness identifies 185+) = P(Witness identifies 185+ | 185+) \* P(185+) / P(Witness identifies 185+)

= (0.8) \* (0.15) / ((0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85))

= 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
