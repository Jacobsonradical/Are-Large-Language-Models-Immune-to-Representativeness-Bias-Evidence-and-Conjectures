Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From statement b, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (P(B|A) = 0.8) and errs 20% of the time (P(B'|A) = 0.2).

From statement a, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (P(A) = 0.15).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

However, we don't directly have P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To compute this, we need to consider both correct identifications and errors:

P(B) = P(B intersect A) + P(B intersect A')

Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
