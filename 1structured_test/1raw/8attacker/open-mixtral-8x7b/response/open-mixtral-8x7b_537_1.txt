Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from statement b)

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually not 185 cm or taller:

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, as mentioned in statement b)

Now, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size (from statement a), the overall probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

Therefore, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information as follows:

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller | witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller)

P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (as calculated earlier)

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual height is 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is 185 cm or taller) + 
P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller | actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(actual height is NOT 185 cm or taller)

P(witness identifies 185 cm or taller) = 
(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6 (calculation provided for clarity)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

probability: 0.625 (approximately)
