To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. If the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attackers' heights. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(185+ | witness identifies as 185+) = P(witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) \* P(185+) / P(witness identifies as 185+)

We know that:
P(witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(185+) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(witness identifies as 185+), we can use the law of total probability:

P(witness identifies as 185+) = P(witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) \* P(185+) + P(witness identifies as 185+ | <185) \* P(<185)

We know that:
P(witness identifies as 185+ | 185+) = 0.8
P(185+) = 0.15
P(witness identifies as 185+ | <185) = 0.2 (the witness is mistaken 20% of the time)
P(<185) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

So,
P(witness identifies as 185+) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(185+ | witness identifies as 185+) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
