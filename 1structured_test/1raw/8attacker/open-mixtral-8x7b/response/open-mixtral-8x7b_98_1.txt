Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This suggests that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote this probability as P(Tall).

From statement a, we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, a reasonable estimate for P(Tall) would be 0.15 based solely on this information.

However, we also have information about the witness's ability to judge height. Statement b tells us that the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, considering both pieces of information, a more refined estimate for P(Tall) would be the product of the probability of being tall and the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as tall:

P(Tall) = Probability(Attacker is Tall) * Probability(Witness correctly identifies as tall)
P(Tall) = 0.15 * 0.8
P(Tall) = 0.12

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
