Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A specific witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a 80% success rate and 20% error rate for such judgments.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use the witness's statistics:

P(tall) = Number of times the witness correctly identified a tall attacker / Total number of attackers

P(tall) = 0.8 * (number of tall attackers / total attackers)

Since the population is roughly equally split between tall and short people, and only 15% of attackers are tall, we can assume that there are fewer tall attackers than short attackers.

Given the witness's 20% error rate, we can also assume that some short attackers were misidentified as tall.

To estimate P(tall), let's assume there are twice as many short attackers as tall attackers (to account for the population distribution and the 85% short attacker statistic).

Let x be the number of tall attackers, and 2x be the number of short attackers.

P(tall) = 0.8 * (x / (x + 2x))

P(tall) = 0.8 * (1/3) â‰ˆ 0.267 (26.7%)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.267}
