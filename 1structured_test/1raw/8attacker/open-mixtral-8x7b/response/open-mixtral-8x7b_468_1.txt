Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

Given that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Let P(T) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so P(U) = 0.85 and P(T) = 1 - P(U) = 0.15.

Given that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / [P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|U) * P(U)]

We are told that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W|T) = 0.8 and P(W|U) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3333

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.3333 or 33.33%.
