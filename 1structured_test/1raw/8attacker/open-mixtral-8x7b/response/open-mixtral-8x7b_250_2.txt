Given the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The witness identified the attacker's height correctly 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem as:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15.

The probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is a weighted average of the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm and when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. That is, P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm) + P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller).

We are given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, so P(shorter than 185 cm) = P(185 cm or taller) = 0.5.

We are also given that the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller and erroneously identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 and P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

Substituting these values into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.2 * 0.5) + (0.8 * 0.15)) = 0.18

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.18.
