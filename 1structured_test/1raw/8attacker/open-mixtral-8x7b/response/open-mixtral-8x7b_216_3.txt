Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is actually under 185 cm, the witness will still say he is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. 

Since we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, we have:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 * 0.15 = 0.15
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1525 + 0.1445 = 0.297

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.297 or 29.7%.
