To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which is a formula to find the probability of an event occurring, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Here, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the observation.

From the problem, we have:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.1 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5897 or 58.97%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.5897}.
