To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is denoted as P(W|Â¬A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 1
