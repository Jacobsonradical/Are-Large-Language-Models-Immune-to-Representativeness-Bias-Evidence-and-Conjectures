Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller are roughly equal in size. However, among attackers, 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to account for both the population statistics and the witness's accuracy.

The witness reported that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. If the actual population proportions held true for attackers, we would expect only 15% of attackers to be 185 cm or taller. However, the witness is known to be correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report, is:

0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.66 = 0.78

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.78}
