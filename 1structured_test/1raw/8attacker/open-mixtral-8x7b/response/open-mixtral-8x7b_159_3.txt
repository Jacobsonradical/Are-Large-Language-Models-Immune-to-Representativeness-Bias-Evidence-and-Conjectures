Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem into simpler steps:

1. We know that the population has roughly an equal number of people below and above 185 cm.
2. The witness, when given a random sample of people, identifies the height correctly 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. We are interested in finding the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability we want: the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the witness correctly identifies the height)
- P(A) is the probability of A (the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and since the population is roughly equal below and above 185 cm, we assume this as a fair estimate)

To find P(B), we need to calculate the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker can be either shorter or taller than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.5. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not). Since P(not A) is the complement of P(A), we know that P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.6667, or approximately 67%

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.6667}
