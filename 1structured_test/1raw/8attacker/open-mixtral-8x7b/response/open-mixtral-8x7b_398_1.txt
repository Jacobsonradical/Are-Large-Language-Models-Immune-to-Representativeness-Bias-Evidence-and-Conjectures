To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we calculate the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller when they actually were: 0.8 (witness's correct identification rate).

Next, we calculate the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller when they were not: 0.2 (witness's error rate).

Now, we weigh these probabilities by the distribution of attackers' heights in the population:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the problem statement), and we want to solve for P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We also know that P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness's error rate).

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.5.

Now, we can set up the following equation:

P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) * 0.15 = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Solving for P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller), we get:

P(witness identifies as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) / 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67 (67%).
