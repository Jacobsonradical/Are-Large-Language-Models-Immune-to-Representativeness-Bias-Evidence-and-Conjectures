To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Statement a provides us with the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions, and statement b gives us the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are given that the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. Therefore:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of correctly identifying the height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of erroneously identifying the height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Statement b tells us that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3600

The answer is:
{probability: 0.36}
