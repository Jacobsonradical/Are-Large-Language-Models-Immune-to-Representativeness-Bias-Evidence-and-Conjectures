Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an 185 cm or taller person correctly, which they do 80% of the time. So, the probability of the event "Correct Identification" (C) is 0.8.

The probability of the complementary event, "Incorrect Identification" (I), is therefore 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. This is a conditional probability, which we can express as P(A|C), where A is the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller".

According to the given data, 15% of all attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, this percentage is not conditioned on the witness's identification. To calculate the conditional probability, we need to multiply the base rate (unconditioned probability) by the sensitivity (probability of correct identification). This is because the base rate represents the overall proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, and the sensitivity represents the proportion of those attackers who are correctly identified by the witness.

Therefore, P(A|C) = Base Rate * Sensitivity = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.12.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
