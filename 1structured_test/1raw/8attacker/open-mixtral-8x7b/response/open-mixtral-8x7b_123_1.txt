Given the information, let's first calculate the probability of a false positive, which is when the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This happens 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height), and P(B|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height).

We also know that 50% of the population is taller than or equal to 185 cm, so P(A) = 0.5. Since the population is roughly equal in size for those shorter and taller than 185 cm, P(A') = 0.5 as well.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
= [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
= 0.8 / 0.6
= 1.3333

However, probability cannot exceed 1. This means that there is an inconsistency in the data provided, and we cannot give a valid estimate based on the given information. It is possible that the witness's ability to accurately assess height in the given conditions is not as reliable as suggested.
