Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, relative to their proportion in the population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such judgments. They are also wrong 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(¬B) as the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

However, to find P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (A) and when they are not (¬A).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not. The witness is wrong 20% of the time, so:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) ≈ 0.25

Now we can finally calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25
P(A|B) ≈ 0.48

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
