Let's analyze the information given:

a) The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. This information is about the witness's ability to correctly judge a person's height, not specifically about the attacker's height.

b) Of such attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information is about the proportion of attackers who are either shorter than or 185 cm or taller than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the formula for total probability:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B is the event that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (from b) and P(B) = 0.20 (from a, the false positive rate).

Therefore, P(A or B) = 0.15 + 0.20 = 0.35

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.35.
