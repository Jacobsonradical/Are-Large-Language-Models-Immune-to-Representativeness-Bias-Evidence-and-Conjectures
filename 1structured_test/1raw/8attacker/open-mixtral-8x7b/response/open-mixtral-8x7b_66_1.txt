To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our prior beliefs about a hypothesis after considering new evidence.

Let's define our terms:
H = The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
K = The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
A = The attacker is one of the 85% of attackers who are under 185 cm

From statement (a), we know that P(K|H) = 0.8 and P(K|not H) = 0.2. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm (statement b), we have P(H) = P(not H) = 0.5.

We want to find P(H|K), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|K) = [P(K|H) * P(H)] / [P(K|H) * P(H) + P(K|not H) * P(not H)]

Substituting the values we have:
P(H|K) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(H|K) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(H|K) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|K) = 0.8

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.8}
