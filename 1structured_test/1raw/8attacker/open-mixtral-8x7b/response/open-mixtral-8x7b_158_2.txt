To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the population and the witness's ability to judge height.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller,
