Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attacks are disproportionately attributed to those under 185 cm, making up 85% of such attackers. This suggests that even though the population is evenly split, taller individuals may be less likely to commit attacks.

Now let's consider the witness's ability to judge a person's height. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time but errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which has an 80% accuracy rate. Therefore, we can start by saying that there's an 80% chance the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification.

However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness erred. If the true height of the attacker were under 185 cm, the witness would have a 20% chance of misidentifying them as 185 cm or taller.

Since we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that a randomly selected attacker is in this category as follows:

0.8 (probability that the witness is correct) * 0.85 (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 0.2 (probability that the witness errs) * 0.15 (probability that an attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

This calculation gives us approximately 0.77 or 77%. So, despite not seeing the attacker's height, given the witness's identification and abilities, we estimate that there's a 77% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.77}
