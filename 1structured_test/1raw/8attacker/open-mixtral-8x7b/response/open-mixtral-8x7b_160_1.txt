Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony, and then adjust this probability using the base rate of attackers' heights in the population.

1. The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (T) is:

   P(185+ | T) = 0.8

2. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to adjust our probability using Bayes' theorem, which states:

   P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

   Here, we want to find P(185+), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both the witness's testimony and the base rate of attackers' heights.

   P(185+) = P(T | 185+) * P(185+) / P(T)

   We already know that P(T | 185+) = 0.8. The base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller is P(185+) = 0.15. We need to calculate P(T), the overall probability of the witness identifying the height correctly.

   P(T) = P(T | 185+) * P(185+) + P(T | <185) * P(<185)
        = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

   Now we can calculate P(185+ | T):

   P(185+ | T) = P(T | 185+) * P(185+) / P(T)
             = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
             = 0.321

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.321, given the witness's testimony and the base rate of attackers' heights.
