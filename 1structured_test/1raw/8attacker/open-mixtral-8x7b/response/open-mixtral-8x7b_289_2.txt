Based on the information provided, let's first consider the general population. We know that the population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm (85% vs 15%). This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers, but taller people, though fewer in number among attackers, are still a significant proportion.

Next, we have the evidence from a witness who is correct 80% of the time when judging height and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height, but we can estimate the probability based on the given data.

The witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since we know the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's statement, is 0.8 or 80%.

However, it's important to remember that this estimate is based on the witness's account and their ability to accurately judge height, which is not perfect.
