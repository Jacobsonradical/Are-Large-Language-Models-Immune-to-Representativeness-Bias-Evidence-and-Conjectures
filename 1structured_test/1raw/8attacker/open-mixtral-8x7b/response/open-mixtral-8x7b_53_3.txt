Based on the information provided, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

The witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

The attacker, according to the witness, is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, there are two possibilities:
1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given that 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller and that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:

0.5 (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller) + 0 (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

This simplifies to:

0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4

However, we must account for the fact that the witness could have erred in identifying the height (20% chance). Therefore, we must also consider the opposite scenario:

0.5 (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm) * 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller) = 0.1

The total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, accounting for both possibilities, is:

0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5.
