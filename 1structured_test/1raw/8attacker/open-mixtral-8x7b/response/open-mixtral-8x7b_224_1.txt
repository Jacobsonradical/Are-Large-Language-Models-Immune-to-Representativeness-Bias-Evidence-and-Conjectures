Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is given as 80%.

Next, we calculate the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the witness's error rate, which is given as 20%.

Now, we know from point a that 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal in size for people below and above 185 cm, we can assume that the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is also 15%.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

The denominator can be calculated as: P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(witness identified as 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Solving this equation gives us approximately 0.5172 or 51.72%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5172 or 51.72%.
