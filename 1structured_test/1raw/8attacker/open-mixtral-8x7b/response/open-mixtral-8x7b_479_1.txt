To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights in similar attacks.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B) as the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm
- P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is under 185 cm
- P(B') as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (complementary event of P(W|B))

Using the given information, we can determine:
- P(W|A) = 0.8
- P(W|B) = 0.2
- P(B') = P(W|B) = 0.2
- P(B) = 1 - P(A)
- P(B) + P(A) = 1

We want to find P(A), and we know that the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%. However, we need to calculate the probability given the witness's information.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B))

We can substitute the values we know:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) = 0.4137931 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
