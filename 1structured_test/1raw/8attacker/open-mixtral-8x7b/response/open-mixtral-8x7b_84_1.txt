Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people might be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with the court assessing the witness's ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions. The witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probability we're interested in is P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (given the population is roughly equally split)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
