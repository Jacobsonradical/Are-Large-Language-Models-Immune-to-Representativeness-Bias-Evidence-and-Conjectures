Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller correctly and incorrectly:

P(Correctly identifies 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Falsely identifies as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can calculate the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identifies correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness falsely identifies) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We are asked for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, so we want to calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) as A and P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) as B. We know that A + B = 1, and A = B = 0.5 based on the information provided.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to judge height is independent of the attacker's height. Since the witness is more likely to incorrectly identify a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, this assumption may not be valid. Nonetheless, with the given information, we cannot make further adjustments to the calculation.

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
