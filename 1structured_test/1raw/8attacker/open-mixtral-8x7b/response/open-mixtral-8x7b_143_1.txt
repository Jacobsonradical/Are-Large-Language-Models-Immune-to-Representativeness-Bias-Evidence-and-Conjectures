To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- C as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

We are interested in finding P(C|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B)

From statement (a), we know that P(B|C) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

From statement (b), we know that P(C) is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|C) * P(C) + P(B|~C) * P(~C)

From statement (a), we know that P(B|~C) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that P(~C) is the probability that an attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85%).

Now we can compute P(B):
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(C|B):
P(C|B) = P(B|C) * P(C) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
