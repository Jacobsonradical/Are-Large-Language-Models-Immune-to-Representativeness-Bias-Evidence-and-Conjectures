Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and at/above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below 185 cm. This suggests that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people.

b. The witness correctly identifies a person's height as at/above 185 cm 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm as follows:

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is at/above 185 cm, and P(B) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as at/above 185 cm.

We want P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the problem, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(not A) = 0.5 (given the population is roughly equal in size), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's 20% error rate).

We don't have direct information about P(A), the probability of an attacker being at/above 185 cm. However, since short people are more likely to be attackers, it is reasonable to assume that P(A) is less than 0.5.

Given this assumption, the highest possible estimate for P(A|B) is when P(A) = 0.5 (the most conservative estimate for P(A)). Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8889 or 88.89%

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8889 or 88.89%}
