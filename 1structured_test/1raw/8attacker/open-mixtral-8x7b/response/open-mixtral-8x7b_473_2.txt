Based on the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are:

P(Correctly Identified as 185 cm or taller | Actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability of a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not:

P(Identified as 185 cm or taller | Actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate for people shorter than 185 cm)

Given that the population of people shorter and taller than 1
