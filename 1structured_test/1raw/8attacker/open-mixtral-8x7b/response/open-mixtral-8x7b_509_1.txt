To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

First, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that this assessment is correct.

Second, even though the population is roughly equally split between people under and at or above 185 cm, 85% of attackers are actually people under 185 cm, and only 15% are people at or above 185 cm.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is at or above 185 cm, and P(B) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as at or above 185 cm.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From statement "a", we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time). From statement "b", we know that P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are people at or above 185 cm).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness. The witness identifies the attacker as at or above 185 cm with a probability of 0.8, but erroneously identifies someone as at or above 185 cm when they are not with a probability of 0.2. Since only 15% of attackers are at or above 185 cm, the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as at or above 185 cm is a weighted average:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
