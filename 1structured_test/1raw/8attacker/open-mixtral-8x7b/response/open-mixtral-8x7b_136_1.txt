Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20% for this category.

Given these points, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

Let's assume two hypotheses:
- H0: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- H1: The attacker's height is below 185 cm.

We want to calculate the probability P(H0|E), where E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(H0|E) = P(E|H0) * P(H0) / P(E)

We know:
- P(E|H0) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(H0) = 0.5 (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to find:
P(E|H0) * P(H0) + P(E|H1) * P(H1)

We know:
- P(E|H0) = 0.8
- P(H0) = 0.5
- P(E|H1) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually below 185 cm)
- P(H1) = 0.5 (50% of the population is below 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, calculate P(H0|E):
P(H0|E) = P(E|H0) * P(H0) / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.4

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4}
