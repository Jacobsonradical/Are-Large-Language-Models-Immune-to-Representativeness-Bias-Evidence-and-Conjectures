Given the information provided, let's first calculate the probability of the witness correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller attacker, and the probability of them incorrectly identifying a person under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

P(correct ID | tall attacker) = 0.8
P(incorrect ID | short attacker) = 0.2

We also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

P(tall attacker) = 0.15
P(short attacker) = 0.85

We want to find P(tall attacker | witness identification), which we can calculate using Bayes' theorem:

P(tall attacker | witness identification) = P(witness identification | tall attacker) * P(tall attacker) / P(witness identification)

We need to calculate the probability of the witness identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a tall attacker and identifying a short attacker incorrectly:

P(witness identification) = P(witness identification | tall attacker) * P(tall attacker) + P(witness identification | short attacker) * P(short attacker)

We know all the values except for P(witness identification | short attacker), which we can calculate as follows:

P(witness identification | short attacker) = P(incorrect ID | short attacker) = 0.2

So,

P(witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(tall attacker | witness identification):

P(tall attacker | witness identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.345}
