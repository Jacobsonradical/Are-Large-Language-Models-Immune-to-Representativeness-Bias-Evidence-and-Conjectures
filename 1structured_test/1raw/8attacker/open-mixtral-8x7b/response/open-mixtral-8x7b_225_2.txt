Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are below this height, and only 15% are taller. This suggests that shorter people are more likely to be attackers, despite their numbers being equal to taller people in the general population.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and their ability to judge a person's height under similar conditions was assessed as correct 80% of the time and erroneous 20% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

To compute this, we can use the witness's accuracy in assessing a person's height:
- The probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).

Since we have no other information to update this probability, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is the same as the witness's accuracy:

{probability: 0.8}
