To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the population and the witness's ability to judge a person's height.

We are given that the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, yet 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. This indicates that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population. However, we have a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80%.

Let's break down the information about the witness's ability to judge a person's height:
- The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying whether a person is 185 cm or taller.
- This means that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Now let's estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correctly identified the attacker's height) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(Witness correctly identified the attacker's height) = 0.8
However, we do not have the prior probability P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller). To estimate this probability, we can use the base rate of 15% from the general population information, given that attackers are more likely to be shorter than the general population.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) ≈ 0.15 * P(Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + 0.85 * P(Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) ≈ 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.32}
