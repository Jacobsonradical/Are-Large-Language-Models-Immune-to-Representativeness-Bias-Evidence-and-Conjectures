Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This suggests that shorter people may be more likely to become attackers, despite their being equally many short and tall people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such identifications.

Given these two pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs in identification 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (50% of people are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.5 (50% of people are shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / ((0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.889 (88.9%)

So, given the information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 88.9%.
