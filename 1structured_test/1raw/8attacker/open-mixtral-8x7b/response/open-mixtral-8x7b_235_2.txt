To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W as the event that the witness correctly identifies the height
- E as the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with an 80% success rate, so P(W|A) = 0.8 and P(W'|A) = 0.2.

From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85.

Furthermore, we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so P(B'|A') = 0.85, where B' is the event that attackers are under 185 cm, and thus P(B|A') = 0.15.

Now, we need to calculate P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the height correctly. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller, we know that the witness is more likely to identify the attacker as being under 185 cm.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|A') * P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the values from above, we have:

P(W) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.8)*(0.85)*(0.85) ≈ 0.698

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W) ≈ (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.698) ≈ 0.172

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.172}
