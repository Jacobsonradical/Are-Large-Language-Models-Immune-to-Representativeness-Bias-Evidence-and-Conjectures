To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, we'll find the probability that the witness correctly identified a person as 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller.

Next, we'll find the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. The attacker population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correctly identified as 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Correctly identified as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
