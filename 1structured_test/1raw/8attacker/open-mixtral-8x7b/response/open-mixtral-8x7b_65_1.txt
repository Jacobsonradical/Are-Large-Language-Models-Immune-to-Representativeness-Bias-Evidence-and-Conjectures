To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given in both (a) and (b).

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that they are in the 15% group. We want to find P(A).

From (a), we have that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Thus, P(A|B) = 0.8 and P(¬A|¬B) = 0.8, where ¬A and ¬B represent the complementary events.

From (b), we have that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(B) = 0.15. Also, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so P(¬B) = 0.85.

We are looking for P(A) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A ∩ ¬B) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(¬B) * P(A|¬B).

However, we don't have information about P(A|¬B) directly. But, we can use the witness's error rate to estimate it. If the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm, this means that P(¬A|¬B) = 0.2, and thus, P(A|¬B) = 1 - P(¬A|¬B) = 0.8.

Now, we can find P(A):

P(A) = P(B) * P(A|B) + P(¬B) * P(A|¬B)
= 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.8
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
