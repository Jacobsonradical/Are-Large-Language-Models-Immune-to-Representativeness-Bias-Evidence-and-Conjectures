To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witness's ability to judge a person's height and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's define some terms:
- Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- Let E be the event that the witness errs in identifying the attacker's height.

We want to find P(H), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, and errs with a probability of 0.2. That is, P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(E|H) = 0.2.

From statement (b), we know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. That is, P(H) = 0.15.

However, we cannot directly apply the witness's accuracy to this distribution, because the distribution includes both correct identifications and errors. To account for this, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in terms of both true positives (correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) and false positives (erroneously identifying someone as 185 cm or taller).

Let TP be the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and FP be the event that the witness erroneously identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From statement (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, and errs with a probability of 0.2. That is, P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(E|H) = 0.2.

We can express P(W) as the sum of P(TP) and P(FP), the probabilities of true and false positives, respectively. That is, P(W) = P(TP) + P(FP).

From the witness's accuracy, we know that 80% of people who are 185 cm or taller are correctly identified as such, and 20% are erroneously identified as such. Therefore, P(TP) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 and P(FP) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.16.

Thus, P(W) = 0.12 + 0.16 = 0.28.

To find P(H|W), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

Plugging in the values we have calculated, we get:

P(H|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 = 0.3571

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3571.

Answer: {probability: 0.3571}
