To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- P(A): probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(~B): probability of the witness identifying the attacker as shorter than 1
