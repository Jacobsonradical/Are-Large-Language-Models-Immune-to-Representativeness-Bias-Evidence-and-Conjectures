Based on the information provided, let's break down the problem:

a. The population has roughly equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm, but 85% of attackers are below this height. This implies that short people are more likely to be attackers than tall people.

b. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80% and an error rate of 20%.

Given these facts, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(Tall | Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(Witness Report)

We are given:
P(Witness Report | Tall) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
P(Tall) = 0.5 (population is roughly equally split between tall and short people)

We need to find P(Witness Report), which we can calculate as:
P(Witness Report) = P(Witness Report | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness Report | Short) * P(Short)

We are not given an explicit value for P(Witness Report | Short), but we know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying tall people, so:

P(Witness Report | Short) = 1 - P(Witness Report | Tall) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(Witness Report):

P(Witness Report) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(Tall | Witness Report):

P(Tall | Witness Report) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
