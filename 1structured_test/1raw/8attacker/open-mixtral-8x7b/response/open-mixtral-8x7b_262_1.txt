To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both statements "a" and "b".

From statement "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. From statement "b", we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm.

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can multiply the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height by the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller:

probability = (witness correct identification probability) × (proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller)

probability = 0.8 × 0.15

probability = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 or 12%.
