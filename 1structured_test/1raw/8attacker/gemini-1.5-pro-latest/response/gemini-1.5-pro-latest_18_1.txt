Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.**

**Here's what we know from the information given:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8**  (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2** (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of attackers are 185cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (85% of attackers are shorter than 185cm)

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)] 

**Let's calculate:**

1. **P(B)** = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B)** = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
