Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "A" be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "B" be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2. State Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (We're given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
*  P(~A) = 0.85 (This means 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

**3. State Likelihoods (from witness testimony):**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).
*  P(B|~A) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time).

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually tall given the witness said they were.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness would identify *someone* as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate the Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.
