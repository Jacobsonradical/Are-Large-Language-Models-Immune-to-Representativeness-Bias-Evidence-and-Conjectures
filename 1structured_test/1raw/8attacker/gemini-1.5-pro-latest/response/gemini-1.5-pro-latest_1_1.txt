Let's break down the information and apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the information:**

* **Prior probability:**  In the general population, the chance of someone being 185cm or taller is roughly 50% (from information "a"). 
* **Likelihood:** Information "b" tells us that *given* the attacker is 185cm or taller, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying them as such.  
* **We want to find:** The probability the attacker is *actually* 185cm or taller, considering the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given that event B (witness said so) has occurred.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) given that event A (attacker is actually 185cm or taller) is true = 0.8 (80%)
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.5 (50%)
* P(B) = Probability of event B (witness saying 185cm or taller) happening (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B):**

The witness can say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1.  The attacker *is* 185cm or taller, and they identify them correctly (0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4)
2.  The attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, but they identify them incorrectly (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1) 

Therefore: P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Conclusion:**

There is an 80% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the base rate in the population.
