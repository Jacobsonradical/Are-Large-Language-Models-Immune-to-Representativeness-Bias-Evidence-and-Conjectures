Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

**Here's what we want to find:**

* **P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall):** The probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the witness said they were tall.

**Here's the information we have:**

* **P(Attacker is tall) = 0.15:**  Prior probability of an attacker being tall (from crime statistics).
* **P(Attacker is short) = 0.85:** Prior probability of an attacker being short.
* **P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) = 0.80:** Probability the witness would say "tall" if the attacker was actually tall (witness reliability).
* **P(Witness said tall | Attacker is short) = 0.20:** Probability the witness would say "tall" if the attacker was actually short (witness error rate).

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Applying it to our problem:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall) =  
[P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness said tall)

To get the denominator, P(Witness said tall), we need to consider both ways the witness could have said "tall":

* The attacker was tall, and the witness was right.
* The attacker was short, and the witness was wrong.

So:

P(Witness said tall) =  
[P(Witness said tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] + [P(Witness said tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)] 

P(Witness said tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness said tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

There's approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the crime statistics. While the witness's testimony increases the likelihood, it's important to note there's still a significant chance the attacker was actually shorter.
