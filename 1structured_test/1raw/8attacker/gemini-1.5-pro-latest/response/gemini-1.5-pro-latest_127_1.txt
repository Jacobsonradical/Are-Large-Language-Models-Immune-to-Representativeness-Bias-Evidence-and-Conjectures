Here's how we can break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height but gives us a measure of the witness's testimony accuracy.
* **Population Data (b):** This is crucial. It tells us that while the general population might have a near-even split of people above and below 185cm,  attackers are far more likely to be shorter than 185cm (85% vs. 15%).

**Reasoning**

We need to combine both pieces of information.  The witness's testimony is more likely to be accurate if the attacker belongs to the group that makes up the majority of attackers (those under 185cm). Conversely, the testimony is less reliable if the attacker belongs to the less common group (those 185cm or taller).

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to calculate an exact probability here, but we can make a reasoned estimate:

* **Start with the base rate:** 15% of attackers are 185cm or taller. This is our starting point.
* **Factor in witness reliability:** The witness is right 80% of the time, but the base rate for taller attackers is low. This means the witness identifying a taller attacker is more likely to be a mistake than accurate.

**Conclusion**

Considering both factors, the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller is significantly lower than the initial 80% suggested by the witness testimony alone.  It's likely closer to the population distribution of attackers, meaning closer to 15%.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.25} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimate. A more precise calculation would require Bayesian reasoning to update the prior probability (15%) with the witness's testimony (80% accuracy) to get a posterior probability. However, the provided information is insufficient to perform a full Bayesian analysis.
