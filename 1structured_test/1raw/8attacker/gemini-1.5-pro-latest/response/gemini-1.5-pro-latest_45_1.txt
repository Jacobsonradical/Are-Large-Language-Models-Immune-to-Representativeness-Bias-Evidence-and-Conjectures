Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** This is the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller based on the general population. We're told this is 50%.
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** This is the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185cm or taller *given* that the attacker actually was 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate for this height group, which is 80%.
* **Evidence (P(B)):** This is the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We need to calculate this considering both possible scenarios (attacker is taller or shorter) and their respective probabilities. 

**Calculating P(B):**

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is 185cm or taller (50% probability). Witness is right 80% of the time.  So, 0.50 * 0.80 = 0.40
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter than 185cm (50% probability). Witness is wrong 20% of the time (meaning they'd incorrectly say the attacker is taller). So, 0.50 * 0.20 = 0.10

P(B) = Probability of Scenario 1 + Probability of Scenario 2 = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.50 = 0.80

**Answer:** {probability: 0.80} 

Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate information, there is an 80% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.
