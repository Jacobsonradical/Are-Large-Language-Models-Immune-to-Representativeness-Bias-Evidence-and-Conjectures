Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.**

**Here's what we know from the information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2** (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rates of attacker heights, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.**
