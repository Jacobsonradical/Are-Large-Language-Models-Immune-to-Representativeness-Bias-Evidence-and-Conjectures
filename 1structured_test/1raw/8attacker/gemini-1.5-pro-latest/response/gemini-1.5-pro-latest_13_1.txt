Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

* Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**From the information given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability the witness correctly identifies height given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) 
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and base rates, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.**
