Here's how we can break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is decent at judging height, with an 80% accuracy rate under similar conditions. 
* **Attacker Base Rate (b):** This tells us that people taller than 185cm are much less likely to be attackers in general, regardless of the witness testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this kind of problem. It lets us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being tall) given prior knowledge (base rate) and new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness would say "tall" IF the attacker was actually tall (this is their 80% accuracy rate).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being tall (15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" (This needs further calculation).

**Calculating P(B)**

The witness could say "tall" in two ways:

1.  The attacker IS tall, and they identify correctly: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
2.  The attacker IS NOT tall, but they identify incorrectly: P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, the total probability of the witness saying "tall" is: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces for Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

While the witness's testimony provides some evidence towards the attacker being tall, the low base rate of tall attackers significantly tempers the probability. There's still a slightly higher chance the attacker was shorter than 185cm.
