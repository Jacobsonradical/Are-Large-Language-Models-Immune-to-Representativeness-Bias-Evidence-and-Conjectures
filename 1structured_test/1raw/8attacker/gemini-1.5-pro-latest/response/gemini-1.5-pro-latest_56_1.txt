Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Here's what we know:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "a")
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from information "b")
* **P(B|not A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller = 0.20

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall (regardless of whether they're actually right or wrong), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
