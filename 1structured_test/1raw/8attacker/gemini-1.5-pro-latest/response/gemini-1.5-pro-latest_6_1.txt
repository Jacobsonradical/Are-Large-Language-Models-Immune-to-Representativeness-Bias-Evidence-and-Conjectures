Here's how we can break down the information and calculate the probability:

**Let's define events:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Witness reliability: Correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2** (Witness unreliability: Incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the witness said they were tall.

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights, there's approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.**
