Here's how to break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is decent at judging height but not perfect (80% accuracy). This means their testimony isn't absolute proof.
* **Base Rate (b):** This is crucial.  Attackers being 185cm+ is statistically less likely (15%) than them being shorter (85%). This base rate significantly influences our final probability.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

While we could use a formal Bayesian calculation, a more intuitive explanation is:

1. **Start with the base rate:** There's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm+ based purely on population statistics.

2. **Factor in the witness:** 
   *  The witness is 80% likely to be right when someone is actually 185cm+.
   *  This means the 15% base rate gets an 80% "boost" from the witness. 

3. **Rough Calculation:** 0.15 (base rate) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 

**Important Note:** We're simplifying. A true Bayesian calculation would also account for the 20% chance the witness is wrong, adjusting the probability downwards. However, given the relatively high accuracy of the witness, our simplified approach provides a reasonable estimate.

**Answer**

{probability: 0.12} 

This means there's approximately a 12% chance the attacker was 185cm or taller, considering both the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights.
