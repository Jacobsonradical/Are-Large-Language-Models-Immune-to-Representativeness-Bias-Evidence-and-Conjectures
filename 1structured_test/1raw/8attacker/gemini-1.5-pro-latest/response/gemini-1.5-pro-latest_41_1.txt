Let's analyze the information provided:

* **Prior Probability (from 'a'):**  Before considering the witness testimony, there's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller based purely on attacker demographics.
* **Witness Reliability (from 'b'):** The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions. 

We need to combine this information to update our belief about the attacker's height. This is a classic example of needing Bayes' Theorem. However, we can approximate the answer through a more intuitive approach:

1. **Hypothetical Scenario:** Imagine 100 instances of this crime happening.
2. **Attacker Heights:** Based on 'a', roughly 15 out of these 100 cases would involve attackers who are 185cm or taller.
3. **Witness Accuracy:** Out of these 15 cases, the witness would correctly identify the height in approximately 80% of them (15 * 0.8 = 12 cases). 
4. **Witness Errors:** The witness would also incorrectly identify some shorter attackers as being 185cm or taller. Let's assume roughly 10% of the remaining 85 cases (85 * 0.1 = 8.5, let's round to 9).
5. **Total "Positive" Identifications:** The witness would claim the attacker was 185cm or taller in about 21 cases (12 correct + 9 incorrect).
6. **Probability:** Out of these 21 cases, 12 involved attackers who were actually that tall. Therefore, the probability the attacker was 185cm or taller given the witness testimony is approximately 12/21 = 0.57.

**Important Note:** This is a simplification.  Bayes' Theorem would provide a more precise calculation, accounting for factors like the witness's error rate for both tall and short individuals.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.57}
