Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are 185cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of attackers are shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: If the attacker is tall, the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: If the attacker is short, the witness misidentifies them as tall 20% of the time)

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is actually tall given the witness said they were.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
