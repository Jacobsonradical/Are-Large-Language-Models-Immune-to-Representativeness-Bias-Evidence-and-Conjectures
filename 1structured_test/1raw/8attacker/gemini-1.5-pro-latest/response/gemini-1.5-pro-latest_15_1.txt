Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

**What we want to know:**

* **P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall):** The probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the witness said they were.

**What we know:**

* **P(Attacker is tall) = 0.15:** Prior probability of an attacker being tall (from information "a").
* **P(Attacker is short) = 0.85:** Prior probability of an attacker being short.
* **P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) = 0.80:** Probability the witness would say "tall" if the attacker was actually tall.
* **P(Witness says tall | Attacker is short) = 0.20:** Probability the witness would say "tall" if the attacker was actually short (they would be wrong).

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To apply this, we need to calculate the denominator, P(B), which is the overall probability the witness would say "tall".  We can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness says tall) = [P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] + [P(Witness says tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)]

P(Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, back to Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.**
