Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**We know:**

* **Prior probability (from population data):** 
    * P(Height < 185cm) = 0.5
    * P(Height >= 185cm) = 0.5
* **Attacker height distribution:**
    * P(Attacker < 185cm) = 0.85
    * P(Attacker >= 185cm) = 0.15
* **Witness reliability:**
    * P(Witness Correct | Height >= 185cm) = 0.80 (True positive rate)
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Height >= 185cm) = 0.20 (False negative rate)
    * P(Witness Correct | Height < 185cm) = 0.80 (True negative rate)
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Height < 185cm) = 0.20 (False positive rate) 

**We want to find:**

* P(Height >= 185cm | Witness says >= 185cm): The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* A: Attacker is 185cm or taller 
* B: Witness says attacker is 185cm or taller

Let's break down the calculation:

1. **P(B|A):** Probability the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's true positive rate, 0.80.

2. **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller, 0.15.

3. **P(B):** Probability the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of actual height). We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(Height >= 185cm | Witness says >= 185cm) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
