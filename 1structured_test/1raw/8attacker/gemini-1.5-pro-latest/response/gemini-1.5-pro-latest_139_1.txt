Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Terminology**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**We want to find: P(A|B) **- the probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Information we have:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are 185cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of attackers are shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: If the attacker IS 185cm or taller, the witness has an 80% chance of being correct)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: If the attacker is SHORTER than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly say they were taller)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying someone is taller (regardless of whether they are actually), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
