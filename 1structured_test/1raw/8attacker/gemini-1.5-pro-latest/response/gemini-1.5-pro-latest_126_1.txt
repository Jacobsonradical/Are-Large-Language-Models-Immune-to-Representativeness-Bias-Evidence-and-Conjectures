Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Definitions**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**We want to find: P(A|B) **- the probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Information from the prompt:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability the witness correctly identifies height, given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height, given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
