Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the witness said so.**

Here's how the information translates:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15%) based on the information provided.
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm. This is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller when they actually are. This is 0.80 (80%).
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is 0.20 (20%).

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rates of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
