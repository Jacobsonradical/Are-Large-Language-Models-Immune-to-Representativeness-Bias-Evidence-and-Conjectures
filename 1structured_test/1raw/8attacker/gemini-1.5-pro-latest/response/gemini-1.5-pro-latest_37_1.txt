Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

**Terminology**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**We want to find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Information we have:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "a")
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm = 0.85 
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies height given the attacker IS 185cm or taller = 0.80 (from information "b")
* **P(B|not A):** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height given the attacker IS SHORTER than 185cm = 0.20

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, given the witness's identification.**
