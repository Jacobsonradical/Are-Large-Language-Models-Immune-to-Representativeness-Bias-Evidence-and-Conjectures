Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from statement "a"):**  Without the witness, there's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller based on attacker demographics.
* **Witness Reliability (from statement "b"):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate updated probabilities given new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened. 
   * In our case: Probability the attacker is 185cm+ tall (A) GIVEN that the witness said so (B).
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
   * In our case: Probability the witness says 185cm+ tall (B) GIVEN the attacker IS actually 185cm+ tall (A) = 80% (witness reliability).
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening.
   * In our case: Prior probability the attacker is 185cm+ tall = 15%.
* P(B) = Probability of event B happening (this can get a bit complex to calculate directly).

**Simplified Calculation**

We can use a simplified approach since we have equal population sizes and the witness's accuracy is the same for both taller and shorter individuals:

1. **Start with the odds:** The prior odds of the attacker being 185cm+ tall are 15:85 (or approximately 3:17).

2. **Adjust the odds based on witness reliability:** Since the witness is 80% reliable, we multiply the "pro" side of the odds by 0.8 and the "con" side by 0.2 (the error rate): (3 * 0.8) : (17 * 0.2) = 2.4 : 3.4

3. **Convert the odds back to probability:**
   * Total ratio parts: 2.4 + 3.4 = 5.8
   * Probability of attacker being 185cm+ tall: 2.4 / 5.8 â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41} 

**Important Note:** This is a simplified estimation. A more precise calculation would involve considering various factors that might influence the witness's accuracy in this specific situation (e.g., lighting, distance, distractions).
