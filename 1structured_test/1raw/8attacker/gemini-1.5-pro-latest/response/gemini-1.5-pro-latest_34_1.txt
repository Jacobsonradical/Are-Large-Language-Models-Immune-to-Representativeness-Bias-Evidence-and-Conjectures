Here's how to break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This doesn't directly tell us the attacker's height but gives us a measure of confidence in their statement.
* **Attacker Profile (b):** This is crucial. It tells us that attackers of this type are much more likely to be shorter than 185cm (85% vs. 15%). 

**Combining the Information**

We need to weigh the witness's testimony against the general likelihood of attackers being a certain height. 

* **If we ignored the attacker profile**, there's an 80% chance the witness is correct about the height (based on their reliability).
* **However, we know attackers are much more likely to be shorter**. This significantly lowers the probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability**

It's difficult to give a precise numerical probability without a more formal Bayesian analysis. However, we can make a reasonable estimate:

The attacker being 185cm or taller is less likely given the general attacker profile.  Therefore, we need to adjust the 80% witness reliability downwards. Considering the strong bias towards shorter attackers, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is likely **significantly lower than 50%**, and probably closer to the base rate of **15%**.

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.2} 

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A more accurate probability would require applying Bayesian reasoning with more precise data.
