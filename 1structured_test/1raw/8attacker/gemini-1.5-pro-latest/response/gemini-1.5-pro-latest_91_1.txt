Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

*  Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "B" be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. State the Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are 185cm or taller)
*  P(¬A) = 0.85 (Prior probability: 85% of attackers are shorter than 185cm)
*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (Likelihood: If the attacker is tall, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time)
*  P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (Likelihood: If the attacker is not tall, the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's identification.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying "tall", we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate:**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.4%.
