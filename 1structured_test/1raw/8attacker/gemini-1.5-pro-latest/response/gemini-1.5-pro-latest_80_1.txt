Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Prior Probability (from information "a"):**
    *  P(Shorter than 185cm) = 0.5 
    *  P(185cm or taller) = 0.5
    *  P(Attacker | Shorter than 185cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter)
    *  P(Attacker | 185cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are taller)

* **Witness Reliability (from information "b"):**
    * P(Witness Correct | 185cm or taller) = 0.80 (80% accurate when the person is actually tall)
    * P(Witness Incorrect | 185cm or taller) = 0.20 (20% error rate)

**What we want to find:**

* **Posterior Probability:** P(185cm or taller | Witness says "185cm or taller") -  The probability the attacker was actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* A: Attacker is 185cm or taller
* B: Witness says "185cm or taller"

To make the calculation easier, let's break down the denominator, P(B), using the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

Let's plug in the values:

* P(B|A): P(Witness Correct | 185cm or taller) = 0.80
* P(A): P(185cm or taller) = 0.5
* P(B| not A): P(Witness Incorrect | Shorter than 185cm) = 0.20 (Since the witness has a 20% error rate overall)
* P(not A): P(Shorter than 185cm) = 0.5

Now we can calculate:

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.5) + (0.20 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

* P(185cm or taller | Witness says "185cm or taller") = (0.80 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.80 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.80} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rates, there is an 80% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.**
