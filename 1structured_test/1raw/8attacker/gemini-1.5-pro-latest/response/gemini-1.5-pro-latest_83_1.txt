Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Prior Probability (from general population):** 
    *  P(Height < 185cm) = 0.5
    *  P(Height >= 185cm) = 0.5
* **Attacker Height Distribution (from crime statistics):**
    * P(Attacker < 185cm) = 0.85
    * P(Attacker >= 185cm) = 0.15
* **Witness Reliability:**
    * P(Witness Correct | Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.8 
    * P(Witness Correct | Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.8
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.2
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.2

**We want to find:**

* P(Actual Height >= 185cm | Witness Says >= 185cm) 

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* A: Actual Height >= 185cm
* B: Witness Says >= 185cm

Let's expand P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

* P(Witness Says >= 185cm | Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.8 
* P(Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.15 (from attacker statistics)
* P(Witness Says >= 185cm | Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.2
* P(Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.85 (from attacker statistics)

**Calculations:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.4%.**
