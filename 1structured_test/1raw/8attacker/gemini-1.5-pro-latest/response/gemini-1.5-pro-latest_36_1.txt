Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**Here's what we know from the given information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: If the attacker is actually tall, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (Likelihood: If the attacker is actually short, the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time)

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rates, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
