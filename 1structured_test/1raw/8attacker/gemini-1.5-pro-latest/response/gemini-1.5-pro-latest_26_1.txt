Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability (a):** The witness is 80% accurate in judging height under similar conditions. This means their statement isn't foolproof.
* **Population Distribution (b):**  While the general population might have a 50/50 split on height, attackers don't follow the same distribution.  Attackers are much more likely (85%) to be under 185cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This scenario is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given prior knowledge (witness testimony and population distribution).

Here's a simplified way to approach it:

1. **Scenarios:** There are four possible scenarios:
   * **True Positive (TP):** Witness correct, attacker IS 185cm+ 
   * **False Positive (FP):** Witness incorrect, attacker is NOT 185cm+
   * **True Negative (TN):** Not relevant here (witness said "taller", not "shorter")
   * **False Negative (FN):** Not relevant here (witness said "taller", not "shorter")

2. **Calculate Probabilities:**
   * **P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness says "taller"):** This is what we want to find.
   * **P(Witness says "taller" | Attacker is 185cm+):** This is the witness's accuracy for true positives (80% or 0.8)
   * **P(Attacker is 185cm+):** This is the prior probability of an attacker being 185cm+ (15% or 0.15)
   * **P(Witness says "taller"):** This can be calculated by considering both ways the witness might say "taller" (true positives and false positives). We'll come back to this.

3. **Putting it together (simplified):**  Since we're dealing with proportions, we can think of it like this:

   * Out of every 100 attackers: 
      * 15 are 185cm+ and 85 are shorter.
      * Of the 15 taller attackers, the witness would correctly identify 80% (0.8 * 15 = 12)
      * Of the 85 shorter attackers, the witness would incorrectly identify 20% (0.2 * 85 = 17) as taller.
   * So, the witness would say "taller" in 29 cases (12 + 17), and only 12 of those would be correct.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   * **P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness says "taller") =  12 / 29  â‰ˆ 0.41**

**{probability: 0.41}**

**Important Note:** This is a simplified explanation.  Bayes' Theorem provides a more formal framework for this calculation.  However, the logic remains the same.
