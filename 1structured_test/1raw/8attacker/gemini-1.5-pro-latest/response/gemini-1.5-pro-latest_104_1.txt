Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness said they were.

**Here's what we know from the information given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller (from the general attacker population).
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller (true positive rate).
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20:** Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185cm as being taller (false positive rate).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%.**
