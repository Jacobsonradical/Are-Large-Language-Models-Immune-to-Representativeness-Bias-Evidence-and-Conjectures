Let's break down the information and use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Here's what we know:**

* **Prior Probability (from general population):** 
    * P(Height < 185cm) = 0.5 
    * P(Height >= 185cm) = 0.5
* **Attacker Height Distribution:**
    * P(Attacker < 185cm) = 0.85
    * P(Attacker >= 185cm) = 0.15
* **Witness Reliability:**
    * P(Witness Correct | Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.80 (True Positive)
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Actual Height >= 185cm) = 0.20 (False Negative)
    * P(Witness Correct | Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.80 (True Negative)
    * P(Witness Incorrect | Actual Height < 185cm) = 0.20 (False Positive)

**We want to find:**

* P(Actual Height >= 185cm | Witness Says >= 185cm) 

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Let's apply it to our problem:**

* Event A: Attacker's height is >= 185cm
* Event B: Witness identifies the attacker as >= 185cm

P(Actual Height >= 185cm | Witness Says >= 185cm) = 
[P(Witness Says >= 185cm | Actual Height >= 185cm) * P(Actual Height >= 185cm)] / P(Witness Says >= 185cm)

To calculate the denominator, we need to consider both cases where the witness is right and wrong:

P(Witness Says >= 185cm) =  [P(Witness Says >= 185cm | Actual Height >= 185cm) * P(Actual Height >= 185cm)] + [P(Witness Says >= 185cm | Actual Height < 185cm) * P(Actual Height < 185cm)] 

P(Witness Says >= 185cm) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Actual Height >= 185cm | Witness Says >= 185cm) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 41.38%.**
