Let's break down the information and apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability.

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from information "a"):** This is the general probability of someone in the population being 185cm or taller, which is 50%.
* **Likelihood (from information "b"):** This is the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller *given* the person actually is 185cm or taller, which is 80%. 
* **We want to find:** The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the witness said they were. This is the posterior probability.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case: the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller (A) given the witness said they were (B).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. In our case: the probability the witness would say the attacker is 185cm or taller (B) given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (A) - this is 80%.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening. In our case: the probability of a person being 185cm or taller, which is 50%.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening. In our case, this is the probability the witness would identify someone as 185cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We'll calculate this below.

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is 185cm or taller, and the witness is right (80% of the time). This probability is 0.5 (prior) * 0.8 = 0.4
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm, but the witness is wrong (20% of the time). This probability is 0.5 (prior) * 0.2 = 0.1
* **P(B) is the sum of these scenarios:** 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we have all the pieces:

P(Attacker is 185cm+| Witness said so) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Therefore, there's an 80% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.**
