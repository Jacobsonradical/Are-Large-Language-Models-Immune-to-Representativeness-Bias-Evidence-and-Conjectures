Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

*  Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness said so.**

Here's how to break down the calculation:

1. **Prior Probabilities (from information "b"):**
   * P(A) = 0.15 (Probability a random attacker is 185cm or taller)
   * P(not A) = 0.85 (Probability a random attacker is shorter than 185cm)

2. **Likelihoods (from information "a"):**
   * P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall *given* they are actually tall)
   * P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall *given* they are actually shorter)

**Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**  There is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller given the witness testimony and the base rate information.
