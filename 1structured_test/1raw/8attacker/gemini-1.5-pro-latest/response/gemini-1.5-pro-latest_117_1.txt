Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

**What we want to know:**

*  P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall): The probability the attacker is actually tall given that the witness said they were tall.

**What we know:**

* P(Attacker is tall) = 0.15 (Prior probability: 15% of attackers are tall)
* P(Attacker is short) = 0.85 (Prior probability: 85% of attackers are short)
* P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) = 0.80 (Witness's accuracy when someone is actually tall)
* P(Witness says tall | Attacker is short) = 0.20 (Witness's error rate: saying tall when someone is actually short)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To apply this to our problem, we need to calculate the denominator, P(B), which represents the overall probability the witness would say "tall."

**Calculating P(Witness says tall):**

*  The witness could say "tall" correctly (true positive) or incorrectly (false positive). 
*  P(Witness says tall) =  [P(Witness says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] + [P(Witness says tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)]
*  P(Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the base rates of attacker height.**
