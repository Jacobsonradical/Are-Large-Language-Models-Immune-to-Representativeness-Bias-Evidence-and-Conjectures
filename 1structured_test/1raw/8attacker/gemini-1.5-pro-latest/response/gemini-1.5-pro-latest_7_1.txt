Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from information "b"):**  Before considering the witness, the general probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller is 15% (0.15) and the probability of being shorter is 85% (0.85).

* **Witness Reliability (from information "a"):** The witness is 80% accurate in similar conditions. This means:
    * If the attacker *was* 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness would correctly say so.
    * If the attacker *was* shorter than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness would incorrectly say they were taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our prior belief with new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given that event B (witness said they are 185cm or taller) happened. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of observing the evidence (witness saying 185cm or taller) given that the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
* P(B): The total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and correctly identified, or the attacker is short and incorrectly identified).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of witness saying taller when the attacker is actually shorter)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Taking into account both the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
