Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Probability the witness correctly identifies height given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.2** (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

**Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, substitute the values back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
