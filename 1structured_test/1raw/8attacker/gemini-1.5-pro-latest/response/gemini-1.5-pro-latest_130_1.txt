Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

*  Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the witness said they were.**

**Here's what we know from the information given:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm). 
* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller).
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%.**
