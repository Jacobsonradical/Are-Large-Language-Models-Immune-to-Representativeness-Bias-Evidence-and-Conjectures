Here's how we can break down the information and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from statement 'a'):**  This tells us the general likelihood of an attacker's height within the entire population. It suggests there's a lower chance (15%) of an attacker being 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability (from statement 'b'):** This tells us how much we can trust the witness's statement. An 80% accuracy rate means there's still a chance they were mistaken.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for situations like this where we need to update our belief based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is 185cm or taller *if* the attacker was actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying tall people = 0.8 (80%).

* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller = 0.15 (15%).

* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height).  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * Where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185cm.
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as tall = 0.2 (20%).
    * P(~A) is the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm = 0.85 (85%).

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
    * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, given the witness's statement.**
