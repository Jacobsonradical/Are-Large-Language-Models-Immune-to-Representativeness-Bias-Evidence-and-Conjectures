Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller based solely on population distribution is 50% (as stated, the population is split equally).  So, P(A) = 0.50

* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller is 80% (the witness's accuracy rate). So, P(B|A) = 0.80

* **Likelihood (P(B|¬A)):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually *shorter* than 185cm is 20% (the witness's error rate). So, P(B|¬A) = 0.20

* **Prior Probability (P(¬A)):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm based solely on population distribution is 50%. So, P(¬A) = 0.50

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [(P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.50) / ((0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50))

P(A|B) = 0.40 / (0.40 + 0.10)

P(A|B) = 0.40 / 0.50

P(A|B) = 0.80

**Answer:** {probability: 0.80} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate in the population, there is an 80% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
