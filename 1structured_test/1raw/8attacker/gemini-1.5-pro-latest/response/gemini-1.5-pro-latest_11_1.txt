Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

* **Prior Probability (P(A)):** The probability of a person being 185cm or taller in the general population. This is given as 50% or 0.5.
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** The probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy in these cases, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **Evidence (P(B)):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller (regardless of whether they actually are).  We need to calculate this.
* **Posterior Probability (P(A|B)):**  The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.

**Calculating P(B):**

* There's a 50% chance a random person is 185cm or taller, and in those cases, the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time (0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4).
* There's a 50% chance a random person is shorter than 185cm, and the witness misidentifies them as taller 20% of the time (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1).
* Therefore, the overall probability of the witness saying someone is 185cm or taller is 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 

P(A|B) = 0.8

**However, we have another piece of information:** 85% of attackers are under 185cm, and only 15% are 185cm or taller. This should significantly influence our prior. 

Let's adjust our calculation:

* **New Prior Probability (P(A)):** 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller)
* **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** Remains 0.8 
* **Evidence (P(B)):** We need to recalculate this.

**Recalculating P(B):**

* There's a 15% chance the attacker is 185cm or taller, and the witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12).
* There's an 85% chance the attacker is shorter than 185cm, and the witness misidentifies them as taller 20% of the time (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).
* Therefore, the overall probability of the witness saying someone is 185cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Revised Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(A|B) = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
