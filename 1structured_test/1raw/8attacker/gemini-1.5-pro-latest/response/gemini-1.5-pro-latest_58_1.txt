Let's break down this problem using Bayes' Theorem. 

**Here's what we know:**

* **Prior Probability:**  The chance of a random person being 185cm or taller is 50% (0.5), as the population is split evenly.
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller when they actually are is 80% (0.8).
* **False Positive:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 20% (0.2).

**We want to find:**

* **Posterior Probability:** The probability the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem helps us combine this information:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller) given event B (witness saying they are 185cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = Likelihood (witness correctly identifying 185cm or taller) 
* P(A) = Prior probability (random person being 185cm or taller)
* P(B) = Probability of witness saying 185cm or taller (this needs to be calculated)

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) has two parts:

1.  Witness is right: P(Witness correct | Attacker is 185cm+) * P(Attacker is 185cm+) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4
2.  Witness is wrong: P(Witness incorrect | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

**Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is 185cm+ | Witness says so) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Therefore, there is an 80% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.**
