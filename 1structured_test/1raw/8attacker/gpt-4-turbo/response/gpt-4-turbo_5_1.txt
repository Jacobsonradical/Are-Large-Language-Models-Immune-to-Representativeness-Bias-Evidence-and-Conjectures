To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian analysis. Let:

- **H** denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- **E** denote the evidence (or event) that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to compute the probability \(\Pr(H \mid E)\) using Bayes' theorem:

\[
\Pr(H \mid E) = \frac{\Pr(E \mid H) \times \Pr(H)}{\Pr(E)}
\]

From the information provided:
- **\(\Pr(H)\)** (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15, since 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, leaving 15% as 185 cm or taller.
- **\(\Pr(E \mid H)\)** (probability of witness correctly identifying a person of 185 cm or taller as such) is 0.80.
- **\(\Pr(E \mid H^c)\)** (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person, <185 cm, as being â‰¥185 cm) is 0.20.
- **\(\Pr(H^c)\) = 0.85** (complement of \(\Pr(H)\), probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The probability of the witness's evidence occurring (under either hypothesis) is computed using the law of total probability:

\[
\Pr(E) = \Pr(E \mid H) \times \Pr(H) + \Pr(E \mid H^c) \times \Pr(H^c)
     = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29
\]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
\Pr(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
             = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
             \approx 0.4138
\]

In decimal form:

{probability: 0.4138}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
