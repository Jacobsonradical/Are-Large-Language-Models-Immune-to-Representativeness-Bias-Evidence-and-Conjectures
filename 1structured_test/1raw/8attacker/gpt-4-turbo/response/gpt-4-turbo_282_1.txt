To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the above information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed at least 185 cm tall.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( A \) indicate the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( B \) indicate the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people below and above 185 cm is equally distributed)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (probability of correctly identifying a tall person)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (probability of wrongly identifying a not tall person as tall, i.e., the error rate)

Using the law of total probability, \( P(B) \) (probability that witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8. Hence, the answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
