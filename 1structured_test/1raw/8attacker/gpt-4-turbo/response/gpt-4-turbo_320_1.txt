To solve this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

### Definitions:
- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

### Prior Probabilities:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is given as 15% (because 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, given the data about attackers' heights).
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85%.
  \[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

### Conditional Probabilities (from the witness's accuracy):
- \( P(W|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that height, is 80%.
  \[ P(W|H) = 0.8 \]
- \( P(W|\neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, is 20%.
  \[ P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

### Using Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
