To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s testimony. Below are the pieces of information we need:

1. Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
3. From the information provided:
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (this is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on population attack stats).
   - \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (this is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
   - The witness accuracy is given by \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller) and \( P(W | A^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to calculate \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness testified the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, whether correctly or incorrectly:
\[
P(W) = P(W | A) P(A) + P(W | A^c) P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, use this to find \( P(A | W) \):
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
