To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way to reverse conditional probabilities. Given the information provided, let's define the following events:

- Let \( A \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(B) = 0.5 \)
2. \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller),
3. \( P(W|B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such (\( P(A|W) \)) is calculated as follows:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|B) \times P(B)
= 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5
\]

Thus, substituting back into Bayes' equation gives:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5}
= 0.8
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.8}
