To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the witness's testimony that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.

Primary probabilities:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller. Since it's said that the population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(\neg H) \): The probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).

We update our estimates with the additional information on attacks:
- \( P(H \mid \text{attacker}) \): The probability that someone 185 cm or taller is the attacker, given as 15% or \( 0.15 \).
- \( P(\neg H \mid \text{attacker}) \): The probability that someone under 185 cm is the attacker, given as 85% or \( 0.85 \).

The witness's reliability:
- \( P(W \mid H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such. From the question, the witness is correct 80% of the time in such identifications, so \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. From the question, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, so \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \).

We want to find \( P(H \mid W) \) — the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H)P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
Substituting in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.5} = \frac{0.12}{0.5} = 0.24 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.24, or 24%.

Thus, formatted as requested:
{probability: 0.24}
