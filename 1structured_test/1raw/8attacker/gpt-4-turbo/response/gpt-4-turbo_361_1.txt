To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which in this context states:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) represents that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represents the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given their height is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given in the problem:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a tall person)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall when they are not)

First, we need to determine \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and background information, is approximately 0.41.
