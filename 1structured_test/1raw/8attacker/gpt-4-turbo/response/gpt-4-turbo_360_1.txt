To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the general statistics of attacker heights, we can use Bayesian probability.

Let:

- \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. \( P(W|H_1) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(W|H_2) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a given attacker is 185 cm or taller based on given statistics)
4. \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a given attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(H_1|W) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. We use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated with the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \times P(H_2)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1|W) \):

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
