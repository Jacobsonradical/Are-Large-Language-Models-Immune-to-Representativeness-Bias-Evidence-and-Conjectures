To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W \) is the witness statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement,
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (without witness information) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) because the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) since there is a 20% error rate (i.e., the witness wrongly identifies individuals who are shorter than 185 cm as being taller).

Next, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which comes from both the scenario where the attacker truly is and isn't 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we find \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
