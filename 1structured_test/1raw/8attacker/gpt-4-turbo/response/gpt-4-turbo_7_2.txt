To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:
- \( A \): attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information:
- \( P(A) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are this tall or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are actually this tall = 0.80.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \), the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter = 0.20.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c) \]

Plugging the values into the formula: 
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now calculating \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
