To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represents the witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that height.
- \( P(H) \) is the overall probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given from the problem:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a tall person).
- \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.20 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

We first calculate \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness indicates the attacker is 185 cm or taller whether or not they actually are:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
