To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the statements we have, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (this is what we want to calculate).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker really was 185 cm or taller. From the information, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that any random attacker is 185 cm or taller, irrespective of what the witness said. From the information on attacker proportionality, this is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we calculate via the law of total probability.

First, calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \overline{H}) P(\overline{H}) \]

Where:
- \( \overline{H} \) indicates the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E \mid \overline{H}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is a false positive, given as 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\overline{H}) \) is the probability of an attacker being under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Putting values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Rounded to an appropriate precision for this context:

{probability: 0.414}
