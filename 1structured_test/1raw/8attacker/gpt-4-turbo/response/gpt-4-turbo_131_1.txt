To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of any random attacker being 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \), the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are actually that height, is 0.80.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 0.20.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.414}
