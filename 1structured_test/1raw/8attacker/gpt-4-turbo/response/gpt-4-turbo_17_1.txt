To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence, which in this case is the witness's identification of the attacker's height. 

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( \overline{H} \) as the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \( W \) as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the problem statement:
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and taller than or equal to 185 cm is about equal, so \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.5 \).
- The witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that height) and \( P(W|\overline{H}) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter).
- According to the information provided, 85% of attacks are by people under 185 cm, and 15% by people 185 cm or taller. However, these rates appear to apply to a broader statistic of attacker profiles overall, not as direct probability evidence affecting our specific case once the witness testimony is included.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H}) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W) \):

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
