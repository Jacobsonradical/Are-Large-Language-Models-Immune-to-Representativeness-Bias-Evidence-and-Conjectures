To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We set up the problem in terms of:

- \( P(T) \): Probability of being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (50%) given the population data.
- \( P(S) \): Probability of being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5 (50%).
- \( P(A|T) \): Probability of being an attacker given the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- \( P(A|S) \): Probability of being an attacker given the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

However, we need to incorporate the additional information provided by the witness. The witness, who identifies a person's height correctly 80% of the time under similar conditions, said the person is 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller under that condition:

- \( P(W|T) \): Probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given this is true, which is 80%.
- \( P(W|S) \): Probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given this is false, which is 20% (witness error rate when the person is actually shorter).

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]
where
\[ P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|S)P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus, we get:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.

Hence, the answer is:
```
{probability: 0.8}
