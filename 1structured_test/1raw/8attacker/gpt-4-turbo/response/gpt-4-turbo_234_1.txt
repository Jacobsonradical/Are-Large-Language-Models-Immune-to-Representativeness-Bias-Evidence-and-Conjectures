To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, since the population is equally split)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm; here, the witness makes an error).

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) can be calculated as:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now calculating \( P(H|E) \):
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, based on the witness's identification and given the statistics of height distributions and witness accuracy, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
