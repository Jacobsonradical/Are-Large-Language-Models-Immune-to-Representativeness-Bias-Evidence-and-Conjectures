To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which in general form is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \),
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true,
- \( P(H) \) is the initial probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

From the given data:
- Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \), the initial probability of \( H \), is 0.5 (since the population of people below and above 185 cm is equally divided).
- \( E \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The witness gets it right 80% of the time (whether the person is shorter or taller):
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability that witness says '185 cm or taller' if the person is indeed 185 cm or taller) is 0.8.
  
We also need \( P(E|\text{~}H) \), the probability that the witness would identify a person as '185 cm or taller' when they are actually shorter than 185 cm:
- This is given by the witness's error rate of 20%, so \( P(E|\text{~}H) = 0.2 \).

Next, calculate \( P(E) \), the probability of the evidence, which is the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We find this using the formula for total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\text{~}H) \times P(\text{~}H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
