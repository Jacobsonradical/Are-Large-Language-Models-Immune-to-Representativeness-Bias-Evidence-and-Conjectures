To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the distribution of attacker heights, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's each step in the calculation:

1. **Let's define events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is identified by the witness as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \) (Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(A^c) \) (Probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
   - The witness correctly identifies someone's relative height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time:
     - \( P(B | A) \) (Probability witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
     - \( P(B | A^c) \) (Probability witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c)}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85}
         = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
         = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
         \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
