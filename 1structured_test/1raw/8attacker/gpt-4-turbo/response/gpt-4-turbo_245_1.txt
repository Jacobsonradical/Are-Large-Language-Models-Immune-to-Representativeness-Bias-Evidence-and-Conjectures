To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is stated as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as ≥185 cm, given they are actually ≥185 cm
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability the attacker is ≥185 cm
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as ≥185 cm.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (85% of attackers are <185 cm; hence 15% are ≥185 cm)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies those who are ≥185 cm 80% of the time)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies those <185 cm as ≥185 cm 20% of the time)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is <185 cm)

We calculate \( P(E) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
