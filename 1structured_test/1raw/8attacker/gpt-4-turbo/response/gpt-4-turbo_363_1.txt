To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the observer's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The probability we are looking for is \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so.

Unpack the given data:
1. A witness correctly identified whether someone was 185 cm tall or taller 80% of the time and made errors 20% of the time when making such judgments.
2. Assuming the general population has an equal split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, the probability \( P(A) \) (that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5.
3. 85% of attacks are by people under 185 cm and 15% by people 185 cm or taller. This means the probability \( P(B|A) \) (correctly identifying anyone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, while the probability \( P(B|A^c) \) (incorrectly saying someone under 185 cm is taller) = 0.2.

Given:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (based on the attacker population distribution).
- \( P(A^c) \): Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.

Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony and the population ratios, is approximately 0.414.

So the final answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
