To solve this probability problem, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates with new information. In this scenario, we want to find the updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, using the prior probabilities and the accuracy of the witness.

Definitions:
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
  
Prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (50% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \) (50% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Witness accuracy:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We use Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies them as such:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

where \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
