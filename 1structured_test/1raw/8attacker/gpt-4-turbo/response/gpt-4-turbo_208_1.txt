To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. Let:

- \( A \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know:

- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, is 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
- \( P(W|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall, is 0.8.
- \( P(W|A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|A^c) \times P(A^c)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer in the specified format is:

{probability: 0.414}
