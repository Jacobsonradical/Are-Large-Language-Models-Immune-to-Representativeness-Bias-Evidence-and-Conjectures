To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and other information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief about an event based on new evidence. 

In this problem, defining:
- **H** as the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller,
- **E** as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We therefore need:
1. **P(H)**: the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. 
2. **P(E|H)**: the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
3. **P(E|H^c)**: the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

### Given Data:
- From information 'b', the attackers in this population are known to have a distribution of 85% under 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller. So, **P(H) = 0.15** and **P(H^c) = 0.85**.
- From information 'a', the witness correctly identifies whether someone is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, **P(E|H) = 0.80** (proportion of times the witness is correct when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- The witness is wrong 20% of the time, and because exactly half of the sample is shorter and half is taller, the probability that the witness declares someone shorter than 185 cm to be taller is also 20%. Thus, **P(E|H^c) = 0.20**.

### Bayes' Theorem:
Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

### Conclusion:
The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately **0.4138**, or to simplify:

{probability: 0.414}
