To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Based on the given information:
1. \( P(A) \) (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller), given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
2. \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.
3. \( P(W | A) \), the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed that height, is 0.80.
4. \( P(W | \neg A) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20 (this is the error rate).

We want to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the true height:
\[
P(W) = P(W | A) \times P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem, we find:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is approximately \(0.414\).
