To solve this question, we use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way to revise existing predictions or theories (prior probabilities) in light of new evidence.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( \neg A \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- Prior probabilities (probability without witness's testimony):
  - \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (50% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (50% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

However, the history of attacks tells a different story:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Based on the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (80% chance witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (20% chance witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller who isn't)

We want to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = P(W | A) P(A) + P(W | \neg A) P(\neg A)
\]
\[
= (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is about 0.4138.
