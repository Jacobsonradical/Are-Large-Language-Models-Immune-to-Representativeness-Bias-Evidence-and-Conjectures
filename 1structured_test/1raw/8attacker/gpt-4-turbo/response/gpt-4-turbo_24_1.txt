To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Bayes' Theorem updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{\text{P}(E|H) \times \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)} \]

Where:
- \( \text{P}(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement),
- \( \text{P}(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( \text{P}(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller),
- \( \text{P}(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence being observed under all scenarios.

From the problem:
1. \( \text{P}(H) \) is 15% (0.15), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given no other information.
2. \( \text{P}(\neg H) \) is 85% (0.85), the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm.
3. \( \text{P}(E|H) \) is 80% (0.8), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
4. \( \text{P}(E|\neg H) \) is 20% (0.2), the probability the witness mistakenly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

First, calculate the total probability of the evidence \( \text{P}(E) \):
\[ \text{P}(E) = \text{P}(E|H) \times \text{P}(H) + \text{P}(E|\neg H) \times \text{P}(\neg H) \]
\[ \text{P}(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ \text{P}(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( \text{P}(H|E) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{\text{P}(E|H) \times \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)} \]
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
