To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (from the information that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm).
2. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately:
\[ \text{{probability:}} \, 0.414 \]
