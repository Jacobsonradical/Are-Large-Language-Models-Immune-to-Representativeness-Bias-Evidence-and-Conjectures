To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Definitions and Prior Probability**:
    - Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( W \) represent that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
    - The prior probability \( P(H) \), or the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, is given as 15% (0.15).

2. **Witness's Accuracy**:
    - The witness's ability to correctly identify someone as taller or shorter than 185 cm is 80%. Thus:
      - \( P(W \mid H) \) (probability of witness saying 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) is 80% (0.80).
      - \( P(W \mid \neg H) \) (probability of witness saying 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 20% (0.20) due to witness error.

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
    - We use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \mid W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
      \[
      P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)}
      \]

4. **Total Probability of \( W \)**:
    - The probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller can occur in two ways: correctly identifying a tall attacker, or incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker. Thus:
      \[
      P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) P(\neg H)
      \]
      \[
      P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
      \]

5. **Calculating \( P(H \mid W) \)**:
    \[
    P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
    \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer**: {probability: 0.4138}
