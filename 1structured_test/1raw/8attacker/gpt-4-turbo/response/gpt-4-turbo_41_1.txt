To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and the population characteristics, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this case can be written as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

where: 
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W \) represents the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony,
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80% or 0.8,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the problem, we know 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) \) = 0.15,
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = 0.413793 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the general population characteristics is approximately 0.414.
