To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - Let \( P(\text{Tall}) \) be the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the given information that 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller and 85% are shorter, we have:
   \[ P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \]
   - Let \( P(\text{Short}) \) be the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore,
   \[ P(\text{Short}) = 0.85 \]

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The witness's ability to judge height correctly is given as 80% for both categories. We calculate:
     - Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as tall (True Positive): \( P(\text{Correct | Tall}) = 0.80 \)
     - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone tall when they are short (False Positive): \( P(\text{Incorrect | Short}) = 0.20 \)
     
3. **Total probability of the witness saying 'Tall'**:
   - This is the total probability that the witness could say someone is 185 cm or taller, and it encompasses both correct and incorrect identifications:
   \[ P(\text{Witness 'Tall'}) = P(\text{Correct | Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Incorrect | Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]
   \[ P(\text{Witness 'Tall'}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(\text{Witness 'Tall'}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually tall given that the witness said 'Tall'. 
   \[ P(\text{Tall | Witness 'Tall'}) = \frac{P(\text{Correct | Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Witness 'Tall'})} \]
   \[ P(\text{Tall | Witness 'Tall'}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, given the witness's testimony and the prior statistics regarding attackers' heights, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
