To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We know:
- P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (Witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
- P(B|A^c) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (Witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% attackers are under 185 cm)

From Bayes' theorem, the probability of A given B is given by:

\[ P(A|B) =  \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c)} \]

Plugging in the values we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
