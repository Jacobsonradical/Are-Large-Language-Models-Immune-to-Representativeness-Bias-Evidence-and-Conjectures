To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the hypothesis is true given the evidence. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From the information, the population is divided equally, so \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is true. Since the witness correctly identifies someone being 185 cm taller 80% of the time, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).

For \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence occurring, we use:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( = 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|H^c) \) is the probability of the witness wrongly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller (who is actually shorter than 185 cm), which is the error rate \( = 0.2 \).

Thus:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now substitute these into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 (or 80%).
