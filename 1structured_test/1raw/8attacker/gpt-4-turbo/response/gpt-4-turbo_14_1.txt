To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the statistics provided about attack patterns and witness accuracy, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of a condition based on other known probabilities.

Let:
- \( H \) = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \) = Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \) = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information provided:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H) = P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (Prior probability that any random attacker is 185 cm or taller or shorter)
- \( P(H|A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H|A) = 0.85 \) (Probability distribution of attackers' heights)

We want to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]
\[ 
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is 0.8. 

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
