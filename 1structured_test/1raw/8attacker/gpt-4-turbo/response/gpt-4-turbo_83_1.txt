To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in its basic form is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (H) is true given the evidence (E).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the hypothesis is true irrespective of the evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided by the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

Now, we can use the formula for \( P(E) \), which is the total likelihood of the witness claiming the subject is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

However, the true likelihood of attackers' heights must consider the distribution of prior attacks:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
Now we adjust P(E) with the new probabilities:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem again with the adjusted base rates for attackers:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the revised probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the statistical distribution of such attackers, is about 0.414.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.414}
