To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this case is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) (the witness's identification) given the hypothesis \( H \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness's evidence.

From the statement:
- It is given that 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, hence \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- It is also given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. Therefore, \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller).
- Similarly, \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Now, letâ€™s calculate \( P(\neg H) \) (probability the attacker is under 185 cm):
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.5 \]

The overall probability of the evidence (witness's statement) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.
