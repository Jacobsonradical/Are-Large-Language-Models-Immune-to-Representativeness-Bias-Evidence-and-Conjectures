To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the base rates of similar attackers, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) be the event that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to compute \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.

Given:
1. \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller, given the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm or taller, given the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of witness)
4. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a randomly selected attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W | A) \times P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]
First, calculate \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Rounded to two decimal places:
\[
\approx 0.41
\]
Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the information provided, is approximately 0.41.
