To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence and statistics provided, we can use Bayes' rule. Let H represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and D represent the witness's identification that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- **P(D | H)**, the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that height, is 0.8 (since the witness can correctly identify height 80% of the time).
- **P(D | ~H)**, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, is 0.2.
- **P(H)**, the probability (prior) that a person is 185 cm or taller (without any additional information), since the population is roughly equal, is 0.5.
- **P(~H)** is similarly 0.5 because it's the complement of P(H).
- **P(H | A)**, where A represents the information that such attackers are usually shorter than 185 cm, is given by the characteristic that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. So, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller which adjusts P(H) to 0.15 given the context of an attack scenario (we adjust our prior based on this new info).
  
But we need to consider both the witness's identification and the typical height distribution among attackers to find **P(H | D)**, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H | D) = \frac{P(D | H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Where 
\[ P(D) = P(D | H) \times P(H) + P(D | ~H) \times P(~H) \]
\[ P(D) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Rule:

\[ P(H | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | D) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | D) = 0.41379 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately **0.41**. Let's round this to a more clean decimal:

\[{probability: 0.41}\]
