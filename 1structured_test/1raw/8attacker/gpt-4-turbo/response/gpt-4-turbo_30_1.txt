To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let's use Bayesian probability. Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W \) represent the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information:
- The population probability \( P(H) \) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally divided).
- Probability of witness correctly identifying the height \( P(W|H) \) = 0.8.
- Probability of witness incorrectly identifying the height \( P(W|\neg H) \) = 0.2.

The information also tells us that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, which suggests that attackers’ heights may be distributed differently from the general population. However, this information is not directly useful in the Bayesian calculation as it doesn't directly relate to how witnesses identify height but rather the distribution of attackers by height. What we are calculating here is the probability given a witness's testimony about the attacker's height.

We need to apply Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be computed by the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|\neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
Plugging in the probabilities:
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, given the witness's testimony and their identification accuracy, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).
