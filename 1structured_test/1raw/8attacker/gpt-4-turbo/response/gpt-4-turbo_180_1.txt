To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's break it down:

1. Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( E \) denote the evidence provided by the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- **Prior Probability (\( P(H) \))**: Given that the population equally consists of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- **Witness Accuracy (\( P(E|H) \))**: The witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- **False Positive Rate (\( P(E|H^c) \))**: The witness incorrectly identifies people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so \( P(E|H^c) = 0.2 \).

We also need to know:
- **Prior Probability of the Complement of \( H \), \( P(H^c) \)**: Since it's given the population is split evenly, \( P(H^c) = 0.5 \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c) \]

Substituting in the given values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
