To solve this question, we employ Bayesian probability. Here, "prior" refers to the initial probability of the height category of such attackers before considering the witness's testimony, and "likelihood" concerns the probability of the witness's testimony given a person's height.

From given information:
1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(\text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\text{height } < 185\text{ cm}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods (witness's reliability)**:
   - \( P(\text{witness says } \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid \text{height } \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
   - \( P(\text{witness says } \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid \text{height } < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm} \mid \text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm} \mid \text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm}) \times P(\text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm})}{P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm})} \]

To calculate \( P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm}) \), use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm}) = P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm} \mid \text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm}) \times P(\text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm}) + P(\text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm} \mid \text{height } < 185\text{ cm}) \times P(\text{height } < 185\text{ cm}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem gives:
\[ P(\text{height } \geq 185\text{ cm} \mid \text{witness says } \geq 185\text{ cm}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately \(0.414\).
