To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem which updates the probability estimate based on new evidence. The information given can be translated into corresponding probabilities:

Let's define:
- A = attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B = witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the information:
- P(A) (prior probability that attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)- Since the population is evenly split, P(A) = 0.5.
-  P(B|A) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) - Witness's accuracy, thus P(B|A) = 0.80.
- P(B|¬A) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) - Witness's error rate, thus P(B|¬A) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the probability that the actual height of the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where P(B) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|¬A) P(¬A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.50) + (0.20)(0.50) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.50 \]

Now plugging these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.50)}{0.50} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.80 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.80.
