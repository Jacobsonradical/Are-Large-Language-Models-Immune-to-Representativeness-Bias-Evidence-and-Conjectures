To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here’s the information parsed out:

1. Among attackers:
   - 85% are shorter than 185 cm. (Prob(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85)
   - 15% are 185 cm or taller. (Prob(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15)

2. Witness ability:
   - Correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
   - Errs by identifying the opposite height 20% of the time.

We use these probabilities:
- Let H be the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( H^c \) be "Attacker is shorter than 185 cm".
- Let W be the event "Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From Bayes’ theorem, we have:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | H^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We first calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore:
