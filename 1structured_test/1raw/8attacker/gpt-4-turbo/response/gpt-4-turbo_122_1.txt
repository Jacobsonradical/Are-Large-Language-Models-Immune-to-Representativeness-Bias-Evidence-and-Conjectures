To solve this, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller overall.

From the data:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller when they were not, i.e., the witness error when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, this would be \( 0.2 \).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Given that only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (Given that 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

We also need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.414.
