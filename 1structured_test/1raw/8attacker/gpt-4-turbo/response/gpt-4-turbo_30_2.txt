To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our initial belief about the probability of a hypothesis \( H \) (in this case, that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on the evidence \( E \) (witness's identification).

Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(H) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is evenly split between those under and those at or above 185 cm).
   - \( P(H^c) \): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.

2. **Probability of being an attacker**:
   - \( P(\text{attacker} | H) \): Probability that if someone is an attacker, they are 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
   - \( P(\text{attacker} | H^c) \): Probability that if someone is an attacker, they are under 185 cm = 0.85.

3. **Witness's ability**:
   - \( P(E | H) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
   - \( P(E | H^c) \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plug values back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
