To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given these specific conditions and the witness's testimony, we will use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided by the witness.
- \( P(E \mid A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the general population information.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness giving their specific testimony (either correctly identifying or misidentifying the person's height).

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, considering attackers' statistics).
- \( P(E \mid A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(E \mid A^c) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as under 185 cm being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% chance a random attacker is under 185 cm).

First, we calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(E \mid A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid E) = 0.41379 \]

Therefore:

\{ probability: 0.41379 \}
