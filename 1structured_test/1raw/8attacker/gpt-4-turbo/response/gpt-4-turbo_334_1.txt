To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information (from the witness who says the attacker was 185 cm or taller), we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayesâ€™ Theorem helps update our initial beliefs (the prior probabilities) in light of new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let H be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let E be the event that the witness correctly IDs the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- P(H), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (since 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- P(~H), the prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm = 0.85.

Given the witness's ability:
- P(E | H), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall = 0.80 (witness's accuracy given the person's true height).
- P(E | ~H), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not = 0.20 (error rate given the person is shorter).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | ~H) \times P(~H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging this into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:
- The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately **0.4138** or 41.38%.
