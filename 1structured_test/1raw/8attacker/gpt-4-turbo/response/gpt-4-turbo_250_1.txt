To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data:
- The witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller or shorter correctly 80% of the time, and erringly 20% of the time.
- \( P(W|H) \) = 80% (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) = 20% (Probability that the witness erroneously identifies a short person as being 185 cm or taller)
- The population distribution between short (under 185 cm) and tall (185 cm or taller) people is roughly equal, so \( P(H) = P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) initially.
- However, the problem states that in attacks, 85% involve attackers under 185 cm and 15% involve attackers 185 cm or taller. Hence, \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.41.
