To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, \( H \), we use Bayesian updating based on the given information.

1. **Prior Probability** (\( P(H) \)): 
   From the information provided under "a," the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is generally 15%, whereas the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85%. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

2. **Likelihood of Witness's Testimony**:
   - The witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. From information "b," we know that the witness correctly identifies whether someone is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \).

3. **Total Probability of Witness's Testimony** (\( P(W) \)):
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]
   
4. **Posterior Probability** (\( P(H | W) \)): 
   Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the base rates of attacker height, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer**: {probability: 0.4138}
