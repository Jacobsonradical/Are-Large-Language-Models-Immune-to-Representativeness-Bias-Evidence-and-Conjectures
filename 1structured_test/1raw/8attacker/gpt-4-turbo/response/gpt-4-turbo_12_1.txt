To solve this problem, we first need to apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis \( H \) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the new evidence \( E \) is the witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

1. First, we determine the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (because only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, is 0.85 (as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

2. Next, we evaluate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis and its negation:
   - \( P(E \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall, is given as 80% accurate in identification, thus \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E \mid \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, is the error rate of 20% provided by the witness's accuracy, thus \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \).

3. We apply Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s testimony:
   \[
   P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller, computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]
   Then, 
   \[
   P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
