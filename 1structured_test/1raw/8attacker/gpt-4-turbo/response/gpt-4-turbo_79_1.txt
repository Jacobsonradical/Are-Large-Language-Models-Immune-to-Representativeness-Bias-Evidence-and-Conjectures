To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence or observation that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From the information given:

1. \( P(H) \), the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15%, or 0.15. This reflects the general prevalence of attackers of that height.
2. \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85%, or 0.85, reflecting the prevalence of shorter attackers.

The witness's accuracy:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(E \mid H) \), is 80%, or 0.8.
- The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as taller than 185 cm, when they are not, \( P(E \mid \neg H) \), is 20%, or 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138, or as a rounded estimate, 0.41.
