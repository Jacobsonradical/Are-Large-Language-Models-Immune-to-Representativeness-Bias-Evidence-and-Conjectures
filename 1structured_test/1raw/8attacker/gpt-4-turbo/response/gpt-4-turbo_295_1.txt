To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which updates the probability estimate for the attacker being 185 cm tall or taller given the new information that the witness identified the attacker as such. The formula for Bayes' theorem in this context is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker is at least 185 cm tall given that the witness identified him as such (height \( \geq \) 185 cm).
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a given attacker is at least 185 cm tall, prior to the witness's testimony.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being at least 185 cm tall.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

Using the data:
1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% of attackers = 0.15
2. \( P(E \mid H) \) (likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller) = 80% accuracy on such identification = 0.8
3. \( P(E \mid H^C) \) (likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 20% error = 0.2
4. \( P(H^C) \) (prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, to calculate \( P(E) \) (probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^C) \times P(H^C) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid E) \):

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {"probability": 0.4138}
