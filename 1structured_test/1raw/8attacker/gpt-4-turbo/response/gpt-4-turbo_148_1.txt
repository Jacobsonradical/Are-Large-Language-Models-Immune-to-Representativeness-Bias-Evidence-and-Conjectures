To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( E \) be the event that a witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) (because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.80 \).
- \( P(E | \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, is \( 0.20 \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
     \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29}
     \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[
\{ "probability": 0.4138 \}
\]
