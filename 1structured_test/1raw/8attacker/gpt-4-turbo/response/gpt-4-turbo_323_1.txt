To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given evidence from the witness and the statistical likelihood of attackers' height distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**:
   - From the information provided, the distribution of attackers' height is such that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and 85% are shorter than 185 cm. 
   - Hence, the prior probability P(H) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller without considering the witness's information) = 0.15.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H))**:
   - This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
   - Hence, the likelihood P(E|H) = 0.80.

3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E))**:
   - This is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which includes both correctly identifying taller attackers and mistakenly identifying shorter attackers as taller. Using the law of total probability:
     - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H^c) \times P(H^c) \)
     - Where P(H^c) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85) and P(E|H^c) (the probability of incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter) is 0.20.
     - Thus, \( P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

4. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \)
     - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \).

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the data on typical attacker heights, is approximately **0.4138**.
