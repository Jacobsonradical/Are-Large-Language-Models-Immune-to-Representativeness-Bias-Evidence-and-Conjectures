To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence provided by the witness. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height).
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Now we compute \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
