To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attacker heights, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information provided:
- \( \Pr(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( \Pr(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

The witness's ability to identify height correctly is:
- \( \Pr(B \mid A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( \Pr(B \mid A^c) = 0.20 \) (the witness mistakenly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( \Pr(A \mid B) \) – the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(B \mid A) \Pr(A)}{\Pr(B \mid A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(B \mid A^c) \Pr(A^c)}
\]

Substituting the values we know:

\[
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{(0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85)}
\]

\[
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the witness’s identification, is about 0.414, rounded to three decimal places.
