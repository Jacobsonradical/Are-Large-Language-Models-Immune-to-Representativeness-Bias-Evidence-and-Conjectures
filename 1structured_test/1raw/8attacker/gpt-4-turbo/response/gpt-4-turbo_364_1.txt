Based on the given information, we can solve this question using Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \) (probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller given no other information), given the population distribution, should be approximately 0.5 since the population is roughly equally divided into those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg A) \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) would hence be also 0.5.
  
From part (a):
- \( P(A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker).
- \( P(\neg A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are an attacker).

From part (b):
- The witness correctly identifies that someone is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly does so 20% of the time:
  - Therefore, \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \) and \( P(B \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \).

We need to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' Theorem gives:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) P(\neg A)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.5 + 0.20 \times 0.5 = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50
\]

Now,

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.5}{0.50} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.
