To solve this question, we use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnessâ€™s testimony.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker really was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (independent of the witness's testimony).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the description, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15%), since overall, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Assuming witness reliability as stated:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate, suggesting the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Also, \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) represents the probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we find \( P(B) \), using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85  = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
