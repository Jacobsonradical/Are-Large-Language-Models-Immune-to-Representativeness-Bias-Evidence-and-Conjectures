To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided along with Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \) occurring
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of observing \( B \) given \( A \)
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of observing \( B \)
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability of \( A \) occurring given that \( B \) has been observed

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the witness's identification that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

**Step 1: Determining \( P(A) \)**
Given information suggests that the population distribution of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is about equal, so:
\( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

**Step 2: Determining \( P(B | A) \) and \( P(B | A^c) \)**
\( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. According to the data, the witness does so correctly 80% of the time:
\( P(B | A) = 0.8 \)

\( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, when they are actually shorter:
\( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \)

**Step 3: Calculating \( P(B) \)**
We can compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

**Step 4: Applying Bayes' Theorem**
Applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnessâ€™s identification, is 0.8.
