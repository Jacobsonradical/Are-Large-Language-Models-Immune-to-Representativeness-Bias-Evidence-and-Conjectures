To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the statistical distribution of attackers' heights, we use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem computes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) represent the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is about equal).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(W | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that height, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W | \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% or 0.2.

The proportion of attackers:
- \( P(H | \text{attack}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H | \text{attack}) = 0.85 \)

To find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) (the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Thus the estimate is:
{probability: 0.8}
