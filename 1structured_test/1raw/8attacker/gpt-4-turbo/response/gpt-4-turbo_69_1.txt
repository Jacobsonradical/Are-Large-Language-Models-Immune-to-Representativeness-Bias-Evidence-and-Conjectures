To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is how it can be applied:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Let \( P(T) \) be the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. From information "a", half of the population is 185 cm or taller i.e., \( P(T) = 0.5 \).
   - Let \( P(S) \) be the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. Again from information "a", half of the population is shorter than 185 cm i.e., \( P(S) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihood:**
   - The witness's reliability as per information "b": Correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20%. Thus, if a person is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness identifies them as such is \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \). If the person is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller is \( P(W | S) = 0.2 \).

3. **Witness Statement:**
   - The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, so we need to find \( P(T | W) \) â€” the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We already know \( P(W | T) \) and \( P(T) \). Now calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T)P(T) + P(W | S)P(S) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now plug into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8. 

**Answer**: {probability: 0.8}
