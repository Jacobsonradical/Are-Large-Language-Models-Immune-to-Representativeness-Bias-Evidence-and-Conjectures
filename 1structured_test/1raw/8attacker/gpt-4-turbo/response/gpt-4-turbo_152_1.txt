To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem: 

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which in this case is the witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \). This is what we need to calculate.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given \( H \) is true. From the data, the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, thus \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (without considering the evidence). From the first information, attackers 185 cm or taller constitute 15% of the cases, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \) whether \( H \) is true or not. This needs to be calculated with the Law of Total Probability:  
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
  - \( H^c \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was under 185 cm. Thus, \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) since this is the complement of \( P(H) \).
  - \( P(E \mid H^c) \) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller while they are under 185 cm, which is 20% (the error rate). So, \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.20 \).

Using these values:
- \( P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Now substitute back into Bayesâ€™ Formula to find \( P(H \mid E) \):
- \( P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \)

Thus, based on the calculation using Bayes' Theorem and given the information about the population distribution of heights and the witness's accuracy:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
