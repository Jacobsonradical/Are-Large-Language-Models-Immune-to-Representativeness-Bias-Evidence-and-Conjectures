To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps in updating the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence.

Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We are given:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall)
- \( P(W|H^c) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, compute \( P(H|W) \):

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
