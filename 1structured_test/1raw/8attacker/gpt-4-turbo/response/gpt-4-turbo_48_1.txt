To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's the data we have:

1. Prior probability:
    - Attackers under 185 cm: \( P(\text{< 185}) = 0.85 \)
    - Attackers 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{>= 185}) = 0.15 \)
   
2. Witness accuracy:
    - Probability of correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{Witness says >= 185} | \text{>= 185}) = 0.80 \)
    - Probability of incorrectly identifying someone as under 185 cm: \( P(\text{Witness says >= 185} | \text{< 185}) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to calculate \( P(\text{>= 185} | \text{Witness says >= 185}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(\text{>= 185} | \text{Witness says >= 185}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says >= 185} | \text{>= 185}) \times P(\text{>= 185})}{P(\text{Witness says >= 185})}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Witness says >= 185}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(\text{Witness says >= 185}) = P(\text{Witness says >= 185} | \text{>= 185}) \times P(\text{>= 185}) + P(\text{Witness says >= 185} | \text{< 185}) \times P(\text{< 185})
\]
\[
= (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plug everything into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(\text{>= 185} | \text{Witness says >= 185}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and pre-existing data about height distributions among such attackers, is approximately 0.41.
