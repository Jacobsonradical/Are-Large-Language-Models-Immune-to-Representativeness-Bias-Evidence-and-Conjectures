To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes’ theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) denote the event of the witness saying that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker has a height of 185 cm or taller, is about 0.5, given that the population is evenly split between people shorter than and those 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \), the probability of witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is indeed true, is 0.8 (correct identification rate given by the witness).
- \( P(E|H^c) \), the probability of witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when actually the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (error rate given by the witness).

Using Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is given by:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

where \( P(E) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|H^c) P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Substituting back into Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8. 

Thus, our result is:

```{probability: 0.8}```
