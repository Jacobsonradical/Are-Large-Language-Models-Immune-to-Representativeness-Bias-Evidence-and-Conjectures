Given the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. 

Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) represent the event that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

From the problem,
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are that tall) is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(A^c) \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 85%, or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter) is 20%, or 0.2.

We need to compute \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness reports the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) 
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17 
     = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
       = \frac{0.8 * 0.15}{0.29}
       = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
       \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Here's the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
