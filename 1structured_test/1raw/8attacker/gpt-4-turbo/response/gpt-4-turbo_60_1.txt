To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the base rate of attackers' heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) as the event that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given probabilities are:
1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) (15%).
2. \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.85 \) (85%).
3. \( P(W|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall, is \( 0.80 \) (80%).
4. \( P(W|A^c) \), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, is \( 0.20 \) (20%).

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said they are:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

We calculate \( P(W) \), the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|A^c)P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
