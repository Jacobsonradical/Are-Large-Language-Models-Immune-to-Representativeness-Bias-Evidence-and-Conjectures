To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A | B) \) – the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

We have the following information:

1. \( P(A) \) – the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given by the data on attack prevalence, this is \( P(A) = 0.15 \) since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

2. \( P(A^c) \) – the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since attackers shorter than 185 cm make up 85%, \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \).

3. \( P(B | A) \) – the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Given by the witness's accuracy, this is \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \).

4. \( P(B | A^c) \) – the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This error rate is \( P(B | A^c) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) – the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller – is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]
Plugging in the probabilities we know:
\[
P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Therefore:
\[
\text{{probability}}: 0.4138
\]
*This estimates that there is approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification under the conditions described.*
