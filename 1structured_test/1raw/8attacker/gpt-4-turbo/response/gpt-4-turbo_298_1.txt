To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the known rates of attacks by people of different heights, we can apply Bayesian probability. 

1. **Prior Probability**: Let's denote the probability that a randomly picked attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( P(H) \).  According to information "b", 85% of such attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller).

2. **Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm**: \( P(\text{not } H) = 0.85 \).

3. **Witness's accuracy**: The witness has an 80% rate of correctly identifying whether someone is 185 cm tall or shorter given those conditions. This means:
   - \( P(W | H) \) (Probability witness says '185 cm or taller' given the person is 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8.
   - \( P(W | \text{not } H) \) (Probability witness says '185 cm or taller' given the person is shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2 (incorrect identification).

4. **Witness states the attacker is 185 cm or taller**:
   - We need to calculate \( P(H | W) \) (Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s statement).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) (Probability witness says '185 cm or taller', regardless of actual height) is calculated by:

\[
P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | \text{not } H) P(\text{not } H)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plugging into Bayes’ Theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

**Conclusion**: The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given this witness's statement under those conditions, is about **0.414**.
