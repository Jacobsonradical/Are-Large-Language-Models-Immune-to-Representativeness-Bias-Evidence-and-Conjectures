To solve this problem, we should use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us revise probabilities given new evidence. Here, we have prior probabilities (about attackers' height distribution) and a piece of evidence (the witness's testimony).

1. **Definitions**:
   - Let \( H \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
   - Let \( W \) be the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

2. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(H) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15. (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, leaving 15% that are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85. 

3. **Witness's reliability**:
   - \( P(W | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
   - \( P(W | H^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.

4. **Use Bayes' Theorem**:
   Bayes' formula is \( P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \).
   - \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be found through the law of total probability:
     \[ P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | H^c) P(H^c) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. \]

   - Plugging into Bayes' Theorem:
     \[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138. \]

Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the initial probabilities regarding attackers' heights, the updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

**Answer**: 
{"probability": 0.41}
