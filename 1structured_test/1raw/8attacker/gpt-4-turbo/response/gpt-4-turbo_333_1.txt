To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context will help us update the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis \( H \) is true given the evidence \( E \) (the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability that any attacker is 185 cm or taller before considering the witnessâ€™s statement).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence occurring (the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies the tall person).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall, where \( \neg H \) means the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Using the Law of Total Probability for \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, based on the given information and the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

Hence, our result is:
{probability: 0.41}
