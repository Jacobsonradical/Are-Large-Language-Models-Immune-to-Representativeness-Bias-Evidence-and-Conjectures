To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps in updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. We start by defining our probabilities:

- Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E \) be the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to figure out \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the information that only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller. Hence, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is thus \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E|H) \), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, is given as 80%. Hence, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \), the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% (the error rate), therefore \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85}
          = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
          = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
          \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
