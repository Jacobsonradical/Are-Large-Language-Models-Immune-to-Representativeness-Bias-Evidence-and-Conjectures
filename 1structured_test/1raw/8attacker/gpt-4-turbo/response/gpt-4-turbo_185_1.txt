To answer this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's height based on the new evidence provided by the witness. Here, we need to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's designate:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- Prior probability \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller),
- Prior probability \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm),
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \),
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being shorter than 185 cm as being taller \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

The total probability \( P(B) \), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be found by the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:
```
