To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we will use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the data:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is \( 15\% \) or \( 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller based on population data).
- \( P(E \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is \( 80\% \) or \( 0.80 \).

We also need \( P(E \mid H^c) \), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., less than 185 cm):
- Given that when the attacker is less than 185 cm, the witness wrongly identifies them as 185 cm or taller \( 20\% \) of the time, \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.20 \).

And \( P(H^c) \), the probability that the attacker is less than 185 cm, is \( 85\% \) or \( 0.85 \) (since 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
