To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, despite the witness's testimony, let's use Bayes' theorem. This theorem will help us update our initial probabilities (prior probabilities) based on the evidence provided by the witness.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) as the evidence, which is the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, it is equal to the probability of a randomly chosen person (including attackers) being 185 cm or taller. Since the general population is split roughly equally between those shorter and taller than 185 cm, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is also \( 0.5 \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is true. This is the witness accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is given by:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Thus, substituting the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

However, this analysis ignored the additional information about attacker probabilities by height. We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Reassessing:
- \( P(H) \) should be \( 0.15 \) (15% attackers are taller than 185 cm),
- \( P(\neg H) \) should be \( 0.85 \) (85% attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Again, recalculating \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, \( P(H|E) \) is:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, incorporating both witness accuracy and population attack statistics, is approximately 0.414.
