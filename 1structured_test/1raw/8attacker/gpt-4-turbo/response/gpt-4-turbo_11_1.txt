To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller (let's denote it as \( H \)) based on the witness' testimony (let's denote it as \( W \)). 

### Definitions:
- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H^c \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness testifies that attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W^c \): Witness testifies that attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

### Given Data:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) \) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they in fact are).
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not).

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

### Finding \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

### Calculating \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, after considering the evidence and the witness' reliability, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness testified to this effect is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}
