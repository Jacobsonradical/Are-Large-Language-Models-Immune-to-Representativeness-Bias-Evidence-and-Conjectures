To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem in probability theory provides a formula to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

According to statement "a", the prior probability \( P(T) \) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 50%, or 0.5, since the population is equally divided between individuals shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. Also from statement "a", only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(A \mid T) = 0.15 \) where \( A \) represents the event that someone is an attacker.

From statement "b", we know the witness can correctly identify someone's height 80% of the time. Hence, if the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness correctly identifying him as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W \mid T) \), is 0.8. Similarly, the witness incorrectly identifies individuals 20% of the time, so if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness erroneously identifying him as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W \mid T^c) \), is 0.2.

Using these variables in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Here, \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T)P(T) + P(W \mid T^c)P(T^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now plug these back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, after considering the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
