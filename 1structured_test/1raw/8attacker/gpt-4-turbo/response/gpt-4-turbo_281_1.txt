To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to revise the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( H \)) given the witness's testimony (denoted as \( W \)). Here's the breakdown of the calculations for Bayes' Theorem:

- Let \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From information "b", we know that 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

- Let \( P(\neg H) \) be the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From information "b", we know that 85% of the attackers are under 185 cm, so \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

- Let \( P(W|H) \) be the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. From information "a", we know that the witness correctly identifies people's height (being 185 cm or taller) 80% of the time, so \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \).

- Let \( P(W|\neg H) \) be the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is shorter than 185 cm. From information "a", since the witness erred 20% of the time in such conditions, \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|\neg H) P(\neg H)}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{(0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138 (i.e., about 41.38%). 

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
