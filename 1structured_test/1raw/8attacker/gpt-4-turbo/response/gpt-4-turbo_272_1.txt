To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population distribution, we employ Bayes' theorem. This approach allows us to update our prior belief about the attacker's height based on the new evidence provided by the witness.

1. **Setting up the problem variables**:
   - Let \(A\) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \(B\) represent the event that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \(P(A)\) (prior probability of \(A\), that is, probability that a person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equally divided into those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
   - \(P(A^C)\) (probability a person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5.
   - \(P(B|A)\) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
   - \(P(B|A^C)\) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not) = 0.2.
   - From the data, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Adjusting to our current analysis, let's keep the consistency with these figures, using them as part of our scenario expertise.

3. **Utilizing Bayes' theorem**:
   - Bayes' theorem states \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\) where \(P(B)\) can be expanded by the law of total probability: \(P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C)\).

4. **Calculating**:
   - \(P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^C)P(A^C) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5\).
   - \(P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8\).

Thus, considering the available evidence, we estimate that there is a 0.4 probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**Answer format**:
{probability: 0.4}
