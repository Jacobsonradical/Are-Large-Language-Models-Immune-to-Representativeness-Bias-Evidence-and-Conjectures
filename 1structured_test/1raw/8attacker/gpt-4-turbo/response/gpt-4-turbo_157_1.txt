To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represent the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) \) (the probability of \( A \) occurring, i.e., the attacker being 185 cm or taller without any other information) is \( 0.15 \), as 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability of \( B \) given \( A \), i.e., the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if this is indeed the case) is \( 0.80 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability of \( B \) given \( \neg A \), i.e., the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when this is not the case) is \( 0.20 \).

The probability of event \( B \), the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A)
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the witness, is approximately 0.4138.
