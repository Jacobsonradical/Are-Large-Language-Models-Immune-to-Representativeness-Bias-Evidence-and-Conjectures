To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let us use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of \( B \) given \( A \) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall).
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of \( A \) (probability an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of \( B \) (probability the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller).

From the data given:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (as 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) and \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness's correctness and error rates, respectively).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability the witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be derived from:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = \frac{12}{29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified as such, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
