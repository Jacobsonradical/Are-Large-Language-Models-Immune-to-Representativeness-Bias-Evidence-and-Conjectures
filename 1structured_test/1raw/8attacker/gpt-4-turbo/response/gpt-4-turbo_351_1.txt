To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

1. **Define variables:**
   Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   Let \( B \) represent the event that a witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \) (prior probability of \( A \), i.e., probability attacker is 185 cm or taller without any witness information): Since it's said that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(\neg A) \) (probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm): Also 0.5.
   - \( P(B|A) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller): From witness accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm): From witness error rate, 20% or 0.2.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem is given by:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   Where \( P(B) \) (probability witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 \times 0.5 + 0.1 \times 0.5 = 0.5
   \]

4. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \}
\]

The result reflects the posterior probability, accounting for witness accuracy and the base rate of the population characteristics. However, given the conflicting information about the typical characteristics of attackers (85% under 185 cm), one might initially misinterpret the situation without considering witness reliability and base rates correctly.
