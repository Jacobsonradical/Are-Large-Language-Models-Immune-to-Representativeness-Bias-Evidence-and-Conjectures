To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the problem:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the witness wrongly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being taller 20% of the time)

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller, which can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the given data, is approximately 0.414.
