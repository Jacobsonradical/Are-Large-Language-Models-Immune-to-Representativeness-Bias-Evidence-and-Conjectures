To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and known statistics about attackers' heights, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: 
   - The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(H)) should reflect the general population distribution and crime statistics. Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, we set our prior:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \)  (Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood of Evidence (P(E|H) and P(E|H^c))**:
   - The witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
   - Probability of correct identification (witness correctly identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller): 
     - \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \)
   - Probability of incorrectly identifying someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:
     - \( P(E|H^c) = 0.20 \)

3. **Marginal Probability of Evidence (P(E))**:
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \)
   - \( P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

4. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \)
   - \( P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.29} \)
   - \( P(H|E) ≈ 0.414 \)

Thus, based on the information provided and using Bayesian updating, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s testimony, is approximately 0.414.
