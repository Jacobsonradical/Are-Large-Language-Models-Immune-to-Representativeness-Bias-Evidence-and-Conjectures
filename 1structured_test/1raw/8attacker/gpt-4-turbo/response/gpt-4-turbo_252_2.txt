To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the two pieces of information, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \) (what we want to find).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given \( H \), which is the witnessâ€™s accuracy (0.8) when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability of \( H \) (prevalence of attacker being 185 cm or taller), which from the information provided indicates 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller; hence, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we need to derive using the law of total probability.

Firstly, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
Here, \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, so \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \), given as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. And \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) is the error rate of the witness misidentifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (20% error); hence \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \).

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, under the given conditions, is about 0.414, or around 41.4%.

Thus, the final answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.414}
