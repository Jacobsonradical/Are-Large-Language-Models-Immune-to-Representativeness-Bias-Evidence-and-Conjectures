To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for the attacker's height based on the information provided by the witness.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that a witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information provided, we know:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). Thus, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm). Thus, \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \).

From the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when this is indeed the case, is 80%. Thus, \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter, is 20% (error rate). Thus, \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.20 \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Hence,
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is approximately 0.41.
