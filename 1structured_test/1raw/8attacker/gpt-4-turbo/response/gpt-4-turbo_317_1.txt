To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, using the given information, we can use Bayesian statistics:

1. **P(T | D)** - This is what we want to determine, the probability of the attacker being Tall (T, taller than or equal to 185 cm) given the witness's identification (D) that they are Tall.

2. **P(T)** and **P(S)** - The prior probabilities of being Tall (T) or Short (S, shorter than 185 cm). According to the information, the populations are roughly equal.
   - **P(T)** = 0.5
   - **P(S)** = 0.5

3. **P(D | T)** - The probability the witness correctly identifies a Tall person as being Tall. From the data, this is 80%, or 0.8.

4. **P(D | S)** - The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a Short person as being Tall. From the data, this is also 20%, or 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | D) = \frac{P(D | T) \times P(T)}{P(D)} \]
Where:
\[ P(D) = P(D | T) \times P(T) + P(D | S) \times P(S) \]
\[ P(D) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging in the values we calculated:
\[ P(T | D) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

This means the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8, or 80%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
