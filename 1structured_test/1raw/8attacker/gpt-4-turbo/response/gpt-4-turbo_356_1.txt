To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information we have and the steps to apply the theorem:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(T) \) [Height ≥ 185 cm]:** Half of the population is 185 cm or taller. Thus, \( P(T) = 0.5 \).

2. **Prior Probability, \( P(\text{not } T) \) [Height < 185 cm]:** Similarly, half of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Thus, \( P(\text{not } T) = 0.5 \).

3. **Conditional Probability, \( P(W \mid T) \) [Witness Says ≥ 185 cm given True ≥ 185 cm]:** The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. Thus, \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \).

4. **Conditional Probability, \( P(W \mid \text{not } T) \) [Witness Says ≥ 185 cm given True < 185 cm]:** The witness makes a mistake 20% of the time. Thus, \( P(W \mid \text{not } T) = 0.2 \).

Next, use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \times P(T)}{P(W \mid T) \times P(T) + P(W \mid \text{not } T) \times P(\text{not } T)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness testified to that, is 0.8 (or 80%). This counterintuitively high probability results from the reliability of the witness (80%) in accurately identifying a person’s height under the described conditions, heavily influencing the outcome despite the overall population and attack statistics.

Thus, our result in the prescribed format is:
{probability: 0.8}
