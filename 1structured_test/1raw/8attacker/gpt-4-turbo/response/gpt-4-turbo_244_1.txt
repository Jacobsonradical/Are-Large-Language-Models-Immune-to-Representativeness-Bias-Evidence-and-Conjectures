To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the general likelihood of attackers' height in the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \(H\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
1. \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness mistakenly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based on attacker population statistics)
4. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the required formatted response is:
{probability: 0.4138}
