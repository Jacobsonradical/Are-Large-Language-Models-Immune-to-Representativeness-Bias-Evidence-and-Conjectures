To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our probability estimate about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller

We know:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the information, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. The witness made a mistake 20% of the time, so \( P(B | A^c) = 0.20 \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]
Substituting in the values we have:
\[
P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now, plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379
\]

Rounded off, the final answer is about:

\[
\text{{probability: 0.414}}
\]
