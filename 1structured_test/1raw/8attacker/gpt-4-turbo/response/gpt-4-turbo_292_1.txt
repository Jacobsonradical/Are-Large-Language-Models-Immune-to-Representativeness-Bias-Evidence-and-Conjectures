To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the two pieces of available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem will help us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence (in this case, the witness's identification).

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{H} \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{W} \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- The population is split approximately equally between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.5 \).
- 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Applying this to our context means if an attack has occurred, 85% likely the attacker is under 185 cm. Therefore, these are the base rates of attackers, not directly part of this probability puzzle as they could imply dependence on being an attacker which is not inferred to be the case here.
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, which means: 
  - \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W | \overline{H}) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H}) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and calculation, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
