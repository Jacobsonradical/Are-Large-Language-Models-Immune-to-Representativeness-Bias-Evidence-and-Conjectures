To solve the problem, we will use Bayesian inference to update our prior belief about the height of the attacker based on the witness’s testimony.

Let:
- **H** be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- **¬H** be the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- **E** be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know that:
- **P(E|H)**, the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- **P(E|¬H)**, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.2.
- **P(H)**, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the fact that such attackers represent 15% of attackers, is 0.15.
- **P(¬H)**, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate **P(H|E)**, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where **P(E)**, the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \\
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \\
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
