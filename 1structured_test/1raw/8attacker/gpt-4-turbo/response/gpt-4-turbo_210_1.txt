To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the event "attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller."
- \( H_2 \) as the event "attacker’s height is shorter than 185 cm."
- \( W \) as the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the information provided:
1. \( P(H_1) = 0.50 \) (50% of population are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(H_2) = 0.50 \) (50% of population are shorter than 185 cm)

We also have statistics regarding attackers' height:
1. P(attacker \( H_1 \) given attacker) = 0.15
2. P(attacker \( H_2 \) given attacker) = 0.85

For witness accuracy:
1. \( P(W \mid H_1) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies as 185 cm or taller 80% of time)
2. \( P(W \mid H_2) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(H_1 \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H_1 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

Here, \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using total probability rule:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(W \mid H_2) \times P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.50 + 0.20 \times 0.50 = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Now, substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.50}{0.50} = 0.80 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.80.
