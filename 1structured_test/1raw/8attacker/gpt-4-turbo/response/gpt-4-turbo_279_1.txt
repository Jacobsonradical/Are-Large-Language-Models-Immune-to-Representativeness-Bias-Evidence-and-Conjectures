To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is represented by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller; this probability, from the witness's accuracy data, is 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 given 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. We calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability.

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
where:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller; this is 0.2 (20% error rate).
- \( P(\neg A) \) or the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.

Thus,
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting these values into Bayes' Theorem, we get:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, your estimate is: {probability: 0.4138}
