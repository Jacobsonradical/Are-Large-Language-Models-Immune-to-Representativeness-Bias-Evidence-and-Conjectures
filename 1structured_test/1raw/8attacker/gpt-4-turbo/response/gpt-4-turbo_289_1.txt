To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update probabilities given new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know:
- \( P(H) \), the probability that a randomly selected person from this population is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.5 \) (since the population is evenly split).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is also \( 0.5 \).
  
Furthermore:
- 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% chance witness incorrectly says 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter).
- \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \) (80% chance witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

We seek the probability \( P(H | E) \), which is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the given data, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
