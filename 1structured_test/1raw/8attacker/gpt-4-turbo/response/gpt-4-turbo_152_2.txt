To determine the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller using the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

### Given Information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal: 
   \( P(\text{<185cm}) = 0.5 \)
   \( P(\text{≥185cm}) = 0.5 \)
2. However, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm while only 15% are 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(\text{Attacker <185cm}) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(\text{Attacker ≥185cm}) = 0.15 \)
3. A witness's ability to correctly identify someone's height:
   - If ≥185cm, correctly identifies as such 80% of the time: \( P(\text{Witness ≥185cm | ≥185cm}) = 0.8 \)
   - If <185cm, mistakenly identifies as ≥185cm 20% of the time: \( P(\text{Witness ≥185cm | <185cm}) = 0.2 \)

### Calculating the Probability:
We need to calculate:
\[ P(\text{≥185cm | Witness ≥185cm}) \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{≥185cm | Witness ≥185cm}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness ≥185cm | ≥185cm}) \times P(\text{≥185cm})}{P(\text{Witness ≥185cm})} \]

Where:

\[ P(\text{Witness ≥185cm}) = P(\text{Witness ≥185cm | ≥185cm}) \times P(\text{≥185cm}) + P(\text{Witness ≥185cm | <185cm}) \times P(\text{<185cm}) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(\text{Witness ≥185cm}) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we'll calculate \( P(\text{≥185cm | Witness ≥185cm}) \):

\[ P(\text{≥185cm | Witness ≥185cm}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
