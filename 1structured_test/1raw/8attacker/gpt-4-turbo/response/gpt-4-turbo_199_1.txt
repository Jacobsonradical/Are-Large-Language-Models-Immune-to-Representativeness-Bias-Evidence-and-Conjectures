This is a problem that requires the application of Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification and the general population data concerning attackers' heights. 

Let's define:
- **H** as the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- **E** as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find **P(H|E)**, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

We know the following:
- **P(H)** (prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- **P(~H)** (prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- **P(E|H)** (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are) = 0.80.
- **P(E|~H)** (probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not) = 0.20.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where P(E), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|~H) \times P(~H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
