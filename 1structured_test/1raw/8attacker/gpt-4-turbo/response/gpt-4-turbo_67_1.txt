To solve this problem, we start by designating:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and \( H^c \) as the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (80% probability that the witness will correctly identify someone as 185 cm or taller if they are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | H^c) = 0.2 \) (20% probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H^c) = 0.5 \) (the population is equally divided between those 185 cm and taller and those shorter).

However, we also know:
- \( P(H | A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(H^c | A) = 0.85 \) (where \( A \) represents the subset of the population that are attackers).

Let's find \( P(H | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We use Bayes' Theorem, which states:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | H^c) P(H^c) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]
So,
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

This calculation is based purely on the witness's ability and general population data. If we incorporate the attack population probability, the calculation becomes more complex. However, in the setup given, only the witness's identification and the general population split is directly relevant for directly finding \( P(H | W) \) since we don't have a way of using the attacker probability data directly in the formula without additional assumptions. Ignoring the special attacker distribution:
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability, given the witness's testimony and overall height distribution, that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
