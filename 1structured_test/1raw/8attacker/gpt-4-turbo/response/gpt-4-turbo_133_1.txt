To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(B) = 0.5 \) (population is equally divided between under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{attacker is under 185 cm}) = 0.85 \) (85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm)
- \( P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

From the witness:
- The witness correctly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed that height: \( P(W|B) = 0.8 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are under 185 cm: \( P(W|A) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{P(W|B) \times P(B)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the probability of witness's testimony:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|B) \times P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.2 \times 0.5) + (0.8 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(B|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
