To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes’ Theorem, which in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statement.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability based on general knowledge about attackers).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which accounts for both when the witness is right and wrong.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

We also need \( P(W) \), the total probability the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is roughly 0.414 or 41.4%.

Therefore, the JSON-formatted answer is:

{ "probability": 0.414 }
