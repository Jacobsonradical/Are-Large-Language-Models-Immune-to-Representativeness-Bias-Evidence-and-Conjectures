To solve this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here, we'll break it down:

1. **Definitions**:
   - Let \( H_T \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
   - Let \( H_S \) be the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm."
   - Let \( W \) be the event "witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller."

2. **Given Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_T) = 0.5 \) (the population of those 185 cm or taller is roughly half)
   - \( P(H_S) = 0.5 \) (the population of those shorter than 185 cm is also roughly half)
   - \( P(W | H_T) = 0.8 \) (witness identifies correctly that the person is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W | H_S) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies the person as 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(A | H_T) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers who are 185 cm or taller are the attackers)
   - \( P(A | H_S) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(H_T | W) = \frac{P(W | H_T) \times P(H_T)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where \( P(W) \) (the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) can be computed using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | H_T) \times P(H_T) + P(W | H_S) \times P(H_S)
   \]
   Plugging in the values, we get:
   \[
   P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]
   
   Thus, \( P(H_T | W) \) becomes:
   \[
   P(H_T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness' testimony, is:
{
  "probability": 0.8
