To solve this probability problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal.
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) because the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) because the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not.

Using Bayes' theorem, \( P(H \mid W) \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming that the person is 185 cm or taller, which can be derived using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, compute \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is \(0.8\).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
