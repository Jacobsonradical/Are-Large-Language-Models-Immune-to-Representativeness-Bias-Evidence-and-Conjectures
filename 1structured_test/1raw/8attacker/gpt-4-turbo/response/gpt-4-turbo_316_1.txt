To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the provided evidence and statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is defined as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided by the witness.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is that height.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data:
1. \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \) (80% of the time the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
3. \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (20% of the time the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm).
4. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Applying Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's evidence is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
