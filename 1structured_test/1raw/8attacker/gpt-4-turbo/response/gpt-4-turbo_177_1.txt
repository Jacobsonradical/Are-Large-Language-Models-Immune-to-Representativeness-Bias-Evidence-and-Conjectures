To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which provides a way to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. We denote the events as:

- \( H \) being the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) being the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:

- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller are roughly equal. Thus, \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (where \( \neg H \) is the event of being shorter than 185 cm).
- The witness correctly identifies someone's height (whether they are indeed taller or shorter than 185 cm) 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time:
  - \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are indeed that height).
  - \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter).
  
We want to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substituting these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness' statement is 0.8. Representing this in the requested format:
