To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem which allows us to update our prior belief in light of new evidence. 

Let's define the probabilities in terms of:
- H = "Attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- E = "Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the problem:
1. P(H) = Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (as 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. P(~H) = Probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (as 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Now considering witness reliability:
- P(E|H) = Probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller = 0.80.
- P(E|~H) = Probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.20.

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{ \text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H)}{\text{P}(E)} \]
And \[ \text{P}(E) = \text{P}(E|H) \cdot \text{P}(H) + \text{P}(E|~H) \cdot \text{P}(~H) \]
\[ \text{P}(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ \text{P}(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ \text{P}(E) = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{ 0.80 \times 0.15 }{ 0.29 } \]
\[ \text{P}(H|E) = \frac{ 0.12 }{ 0.29 } \]
\[ \text{P}(H|E) \approx 0.41379 \]

Rounded to two decimal places, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.41.
