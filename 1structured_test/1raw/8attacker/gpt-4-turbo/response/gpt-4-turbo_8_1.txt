To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (H), the attacker being 185 cm or taller, is true given the evidence (E), the witness's identification.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence occurring given the hypothesis is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence occurring overall.

From the information provided:
1. \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (50%) because the population is evenly divided amongst those taller than or equal to 185 cm and those shorter.
2. \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (80%), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as being of that height.
3. \( P(E|\text{not } H) = 0.2 \) (20%), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are not (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm).

We calculate:
- \( P(\text{not } H) = 0.5 \) (50%)

The total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, whether they are or not) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\text{not } H) \times P(\text{not } H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Hence, using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \) is:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
