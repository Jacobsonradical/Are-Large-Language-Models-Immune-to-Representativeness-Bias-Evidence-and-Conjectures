To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our previous beliefs with new evidence. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( W \) be the event "a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"

From the data given, we know:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, then 15% are 185 cm or taller). 
- \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(W | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identified someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall, is 0.80.
- \( P(W | \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identified someone as being 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability, this can be calculated as:
  
  \[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
  \[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
  \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem equation, we find:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414. 

In the required format:
