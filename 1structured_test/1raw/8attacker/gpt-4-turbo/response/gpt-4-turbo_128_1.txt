To solve this problem, we use Bayesian statistics. Let's define:

A = Event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B = Witness's statement that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
1. P(A) = The probability that a person (and thus an attacker) is 185 cm or taller = 0.5, as the population is evenly split.
2. P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed that height = 0.8 (witness accuracy).
3. P(B|¬A) = Probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than that = 0.2 (witness error).

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We first find P(B), the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|¬A) \times P(¬A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substituting these into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
