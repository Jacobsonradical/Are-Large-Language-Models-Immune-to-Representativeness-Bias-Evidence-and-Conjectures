To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update previous beliefs based on new evidence. Here, our previous belief is the likelihood of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on population statistics, and our new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the given data:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (0.85).

From the witness reliability data:
- \( P(W|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person (185 cm or taller) as such, is 80% (0.8).
- \( P(W|\neg H) \), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a short person (shorter than 185 cm) as a tall person, is 20% (0.2).

We need to compute \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} 
\]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 
\]

Now plug these values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41.

Thus, the answer in the requested format is:
