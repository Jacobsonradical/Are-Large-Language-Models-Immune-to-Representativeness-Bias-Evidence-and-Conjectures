To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the witness stated the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is true, is \( 0.80 \) as per the witness's accuracy.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \), the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is false, is \( 0.20 \) as per the witness's inaccuracy when mistaken.

We are interested in \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) P(A^c)
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting into Bayes theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.
