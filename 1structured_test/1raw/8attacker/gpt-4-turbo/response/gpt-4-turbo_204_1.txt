To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they really are (the reliability rate of the witness when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(A) \) is the initial probability (prior probability) that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (without considering the testimony),
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- From information "a", the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal, so \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) where \( \neg A \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- From information "b", the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, so \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness says someone is 185 cm or taller when they are) and \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly says someone is 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Now, to find \( P(B) \), the total probability theorem can be used:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 (or 80%).

Therefore, the response is:
{probability: 0.8}
