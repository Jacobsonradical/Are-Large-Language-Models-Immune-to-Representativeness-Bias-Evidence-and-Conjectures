To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information available, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( E \) denote the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

From the information provided:
1. \( P(H) \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) \( = 0.5 \) as the population is equally divided into those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(E|H) \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller) \( = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy as stated).
3. \( P(E|H^c) \) (Probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm) \( = 0.2 \) (20% error rate as stated).

\( P(E) \) (Total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, substituting these into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that a witness identified him as such, is 0.8.
