To solve this problem, we’ll use Bayes’ theorem, which in this context is formulated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness says they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller without the witness’s testimony. Given the population distribution and attack statistics, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be computed by summing two probabilities: the probability the witness correctly identifies a taller attacker plus the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker.

1. Calculating \( P(W) \):
    - \( P(W \mid H) \times P(H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \) (witness correctly says attacker is tall)
    - \( P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.17 \) (witness incorrectly says attacker is tall)

   Thus,
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

2. Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.4138. This can be formatted as requested:

{probability: 0.4138}
