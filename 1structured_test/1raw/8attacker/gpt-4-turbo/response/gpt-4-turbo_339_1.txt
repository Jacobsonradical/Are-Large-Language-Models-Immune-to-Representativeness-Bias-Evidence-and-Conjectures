To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information and following Bayes' theorem, we start by denoting:

- \( H \) as the event the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W \) as the event the witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information, we have:

1. \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \): The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are indeed that tall.
2. \( P(W|H^c) = 0.20 \): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are shorter.
3. \( P(H) = 0.15 \): The base rate, or prior probability, that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, as stated that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \): The probability an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so. Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem gives:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138. This simplifies to the response in the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
