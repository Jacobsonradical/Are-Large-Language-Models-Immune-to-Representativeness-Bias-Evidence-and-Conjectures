To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(h \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid h) P(h)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(h \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- \( P(W \mid h) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(h) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, without considering witness's statement.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data provided:
- \( P(W \mid h) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid h') = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies those under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- The prior probability \( P(h) \) being 15% or 0.15 (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- The prior probability \( P(h') \) of being under 185 cm is 85% or 0.85 

To find \( P(W) \) (the likelihood of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of true height), we use total probability theorem:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid h) P(h) + P(W \mid h') P(h') \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(h \mid W) \):
\[ P(h \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(h \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.414.

Thus, we state our answer as:
{probability: 0.414}
