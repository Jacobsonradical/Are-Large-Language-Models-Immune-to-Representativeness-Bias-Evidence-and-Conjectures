To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which enables us to update prior probabilities (the initial belief about an event) based on new evidence or information. In this case:

- Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) denote the event that a witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, the following probabilities are provided or can be inferred:
- The witness's ability \( P(B|A) \) is 80% (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- The witness's error rate \( P(B|A^c) \) is 20% (probability the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter).
- \( P(A) \) is 15% (from population attack statistics, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \) is 85% (as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ 
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Then,
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
