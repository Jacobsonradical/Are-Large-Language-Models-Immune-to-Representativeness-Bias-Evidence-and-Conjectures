To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis H is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence E is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- P(H) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller prior to the witness's identification. Since the population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.5.
- P(E|H) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From the text, this is 80% or 0.8.
- P(E|¬H) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Also from the text, this error rate is 20% or 0.2.
- P(¬H) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (prior to considering the witness's testimony), which is also 0.5.

Now, to find P(H|E) – the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such:

Using Bayes' Theorem,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where P(E) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and considering the prior probabilities and witness accuracy, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
