To solve this problem, we can apply Bayesian probability, adjusting the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attacker heights.

Let's define:
- \(H\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) as the event that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the data provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.5\) (since the population is split evenly between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller).
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.5\) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(W|H) = 0.8\) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are).
- \(P(W|\neg H) = 0.2\) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not).

We want to find \(P(H|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \(P(W)\), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Plugging these values into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
