To estimate the probability \( P(H \mid W) \) that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness assertion, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) = Probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness' identification
- \( P(W \mid H) \) = Probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller
- \( P(H) \) = Unconditional probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W) \) = Overall probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller

From the details:
1. \( P(W \mid H) \) = 0.80 (witness accurately identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(W \mid H^c) \) = 0.20 (witness wrongly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)
4. \( P(H^c) \) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, \( P(W) \) can be calculated using total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substituting everything into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's assertion is roughly 0.4138.
