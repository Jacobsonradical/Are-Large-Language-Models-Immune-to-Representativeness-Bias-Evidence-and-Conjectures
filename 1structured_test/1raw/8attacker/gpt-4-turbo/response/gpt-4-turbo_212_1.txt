To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior belief about an event based on new evidence. The question concerns the probability that the attacker was 185 cm tall or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Based on the given information:
- The population prior (without any witness information): 
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \] (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(A^c) = 0.85 \] (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

- The witness's reliability:
   \[ P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \] (If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them as such 80% of the time)
   \[ P(B \mid A^c) = 0.2 \] (If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) (the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
