To solve this probability question, we can apply Bayes' Theorem, which is a method used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence, which in this case is the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the information provided:
1. The population is split such that the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm or equal/higher is each 50%:
\[ P(H) = 0.5 \quad \text{(Probability attacker is 185 cm or taller)} \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.5 \quad \text{(Probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm)} \]

2. The reliability of the witness:
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \quad \text{(Probability witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller given attacker is indeed that tall)} \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \quad \text{(Probability witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller given attacker is actually shorter)} \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8.
