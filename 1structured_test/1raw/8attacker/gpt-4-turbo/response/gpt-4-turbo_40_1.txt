To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the population/attacker statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): witness says that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:
- The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(A) \)) is \( 0.15 \), because only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (\( P(B|A) \)), given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.8 \) based on the witness's accuracy.
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(A^c) \)) is \( 0.85 \), reflecting that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not (\( P(B|A^c) \)) is \(0.2\), given the error rate.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging back into Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is approximately 0.414. 

Therefore, the answer in required format:
{probability: 0.414}
