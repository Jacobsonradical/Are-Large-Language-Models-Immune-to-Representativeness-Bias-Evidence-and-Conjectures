To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, accounting for both when the witness is right and when the witness is wrong.

\[ P(E) \] can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid L) \times P(L) \]
where:
- \( P(E \mid L) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(L) \) is the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Thus, we calculate:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the population information is:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
