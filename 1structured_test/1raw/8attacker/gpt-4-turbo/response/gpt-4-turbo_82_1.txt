To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is given by:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (0.8).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given by info on attacker proportions, which is 15% (0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness states the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we can leverage the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
where:
- \( H^c \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly states the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 20% (0.2).
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is less than 185 cm, which is 85% (0.85).

Thus,
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

This value, rounded off, provides us the required probability:
{probability: 0.41}
