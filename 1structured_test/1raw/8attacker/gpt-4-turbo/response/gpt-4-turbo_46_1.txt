To solve this problem, we can employ Bayes' theorem which allows incorporating additional evidence (the witness's testimony) into our initial assumptions (statistics about the attackers' height).

1. **Definitions based on initial information**:
   - Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( L \) denote the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(H) \) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.50 (since population is equally divided).
   - \( P(L) \) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.50.

2. **Likelihood of attacking given height**:
   - Given the population proportion, 85% attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\text{attack} | H) \) = 0.15,
   - \( P(\text{attack} | L) \) = 0.85.

3. **Witness accuracy**:
   - If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them 80% of the time: \( P(\text{witness} | H) \) = 0.80.
   - If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as taller 20% of the time: \( P(\text{witness} | L) \) = 0.20.

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(H | \text{witness}) = \frac{P(\text{witness} | H) \times P(H)}{P(\text{witness})}
   \]
   where: 
   \[
   P(\text{witness}) = P(\text{witness} | H) \times P(H) + P(\text{witness} | L) \times P(L)
                    = (0.80 \times 0.50) + (0.20 \times 0.50)
                    = 0.40 + 0.10
                    = 0.50
   \]
   Thus, substituting back into Bayes' formula:
   \[
   P(H | \text{witness}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.50}{0.50} = 0.80
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.80, or 80%.
