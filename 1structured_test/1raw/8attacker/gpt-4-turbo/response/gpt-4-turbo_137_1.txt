To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayesian analysis. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Assign Prior Probabilities:**
   - Let \(H\) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
   - Given that the population is equally split, the prior probability \(P(H) = 0.5\) and \(P(H^c) = 0.5\) where \(H^c\) is the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Assess Probability of Attacker Being Shorter or Taller (given by "a"):**
   - \(P(\text{attacker is \(< 185\) cm}) = 85\% = 0.85\)
   - \(P(\text{attacker is \(\geq 185\) cm}) = 15\% = 0.15\)

3. **Witness's Identification Ability (given by "b"):**
   - Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \(P(W | H) = 0.8\).
   - Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \(P(W | H^c) = 0.2\).
   - \(W\) is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

4. **Calculate Revised Probabilities Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
   \]

   We first find \(P(W)\) (probability witness claims the attacker is tall):
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | H^c) \times P(H^c)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]

   Now, insert into Bayes' formula:
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Based on the Bayesian calculation with the evidence available, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is **0.8**.
