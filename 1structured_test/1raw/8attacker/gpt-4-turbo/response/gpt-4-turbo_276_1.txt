To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which is given by the formula:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (which we are trying to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they indeed were (the witness's accuracy). From the information provided, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(B) \), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's true height, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they were shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when judging people shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, this probability is 0.2.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Using these values:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification under the conditions specified would approximately be:

{probability: 0.4138}
