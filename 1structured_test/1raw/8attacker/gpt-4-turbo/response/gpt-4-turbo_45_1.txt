To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statement and the general statistics about attacker heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate given new evidence. Here, the probability \( P(H \mid E) \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and \( E \) is the evidence from the witness, can be calculated as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From point b, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness correctly judging that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller. From point a, we know this is 80%, so \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is computed by:
  \[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid L) \cdot P(L) \]
  Here \( P(L) \) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which from point b is 85%, so \( P(L) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(E \mid L) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller when they were not. From point a, this is 20%, so \( P(E \mid L) = 0.2 \).

Now, calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and general statistics, is approximately 0.414.
