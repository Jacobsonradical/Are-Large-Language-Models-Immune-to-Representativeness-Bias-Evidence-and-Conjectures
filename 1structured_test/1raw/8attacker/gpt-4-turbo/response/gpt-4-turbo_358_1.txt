Given the information, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, denoted as \( P(H \mid W) \), where \( H \) is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( W \) is the event "attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness".

From the information:
1. \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such)
2. \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Base rate probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (Base rate probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is about 0.4138.

**Output format**:
{probability: 0.4138}
