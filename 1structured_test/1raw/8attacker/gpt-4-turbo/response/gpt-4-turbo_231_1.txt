Based on the provided information, we will use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

According to the problem:
- Probability of being 185 cm or taller in general (\( P(A) \)) = 0.5
- Probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is 185 cm or taller (\( P(B|A) \)) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- Probability of being less than 185 cm (\( P(A^c) \)) = 0.5
- Probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is less than 185 cm (\( P(B|A^c) \)) = 0.2 (since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \) or the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where \( P(B) \), the total probability that a witness will identify someone as 185 cm or taller, is given by the Total Probability Theorem:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the identification, is:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

So, the probability estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
