To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in simple form states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (Posterior Probability).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which as stated is about 15%).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall).

We calculate \( P(E) \) (total likelihood of the witness saying the attacker was tall) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
