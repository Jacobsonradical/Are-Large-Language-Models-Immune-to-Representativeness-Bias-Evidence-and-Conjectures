To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the data and using Bayes' theorem, we'll consider:

- \( P(H) \) = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is evenly distributed between those shorter and taller than 185 cm).
- \( P(L) \) = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.
- \( P(A \mid H) \) = Probability that the heights of attackers who are 185 cm or taller occur = 0.15 (given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A \mid L) \) = Probability that the heights of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm occur = 0.85 (given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) = Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(W \mid L) \) = Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.

Using Bayesian updating to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness' testimony, we calculate:

- \( P(H \mid W) \) = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
  
Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid L) \times P(L)}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5}
\]

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.
