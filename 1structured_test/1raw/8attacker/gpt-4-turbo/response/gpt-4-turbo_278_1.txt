To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the general attack statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which from information "b" is 0.15.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, which from "a" is 0.8.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

\( P(B) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(A^c) \]) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which from "a" is 0.2.

Plugging in these values:
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness has identified him as such, is approximately 0.4138.
