To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis, in this case the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H), based on new evidence, in this case the witness's identification (E). 

Let's define:
- H = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- E = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- \( P(H) \) = Prior probability of H (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller before considering witness information)
- \( P(\neg H) \) = Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
- \( P(E \mid H) \) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually 185 cm or taller
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm
- \( P(H \mid E) \) = Posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness has identified them as such

Based on the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm)
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\( P(E) = P(E \mid H)P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) \)
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting these into Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414.
