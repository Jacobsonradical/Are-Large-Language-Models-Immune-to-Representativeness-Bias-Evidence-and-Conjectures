To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence available, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the event that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- The population likelihood, \( P(H) \), (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.5, because the population is evenly divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller.
- The likelihood, \( P(E \mid H) \), that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% (0.8).
- The likelihood, \( P(E \mid H^c) \), that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is 20% (0.2).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' equation:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ = 0.8 \]

Thus, given the testimony of the witness and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
