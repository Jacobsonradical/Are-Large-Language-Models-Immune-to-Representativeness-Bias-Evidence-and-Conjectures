To solve this problem, we need to estimate the conditional probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. We use Bayes' Theorem for this:

Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and let \( E \) represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given data, we have:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- According to the witness's accuracy:
  - \( P(E \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.80 \).
  - \( P(E \mid H^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given by the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plug in the values to find \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the supporting data, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
