To solve this, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's use:
- \( A \) to denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) to denote the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
2. \( P(\overline{A}) \), the prior probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the information, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. So, \( P(\overline{A}) = 0.85 \).
3. \( P(W|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed that tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%. So, \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \).
4. \( P(W|\overline{A}) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, 20%. So, \( P(W|\overline{A}) = 0.20 \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|\overline{A}) \times P(\overline{A}) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, plugging these values into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, based on the witness account and the statistical evidence provided:
{probability: 0.4138}
