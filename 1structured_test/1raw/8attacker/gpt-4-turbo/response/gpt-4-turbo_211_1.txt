To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps:

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that a person (and hence the attacker) is 185 cm or taller, is 0.5 (due to the population being equally divided between those under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is also 0.5.
- According to the witness's accuracy, the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller \( P(W \mid A) \) is 0.8.
- The probability that the witness erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not \( P(W \mid A^c) \) is 0.2.

We want to find \( P(A \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) P(A)}{P(W)} \]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid A) P(A) + P(W \mid A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A \mid W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
