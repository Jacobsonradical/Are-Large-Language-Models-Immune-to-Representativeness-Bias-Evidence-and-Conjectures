To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. The elements required for this calculation are:

1. \( P(\text{Tall}) \): The a priori probability that a randomly chosen person (attacker) is 185 cm or taller. Based on statement "b", this is 15%.
2. \( P(\text{Short}) \): The a priori probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85%.
3. \( P(\text{Identified Tall} \mid \text{Tall}) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall. This is 80%.
4. \( P(\text{Identified Tall} \mid \text{Short}) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall. This is 20%.

The statement by the witness that the attacker is "185 cm or taller" is our new evidence (E). We want to find \( P(\text{Tall} \mid \text{Identified Tall}) \), the probability that the attacker is tall given that they were identified as tall.

Bayesâ€™ theorem states:
\[ P(\text{Tall} \mid \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} \mid \text{Tall}) \times P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(\text{Identified Tall}) \), the overall probability that someone is identified as tall:
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = P(\text{Identified Tall} \mid \text{Tall}) \times P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified Tall} \mid \text{Short}) \times P(\text{Short}) \]
\[ = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Now, plug into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} \mid \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the revised estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
