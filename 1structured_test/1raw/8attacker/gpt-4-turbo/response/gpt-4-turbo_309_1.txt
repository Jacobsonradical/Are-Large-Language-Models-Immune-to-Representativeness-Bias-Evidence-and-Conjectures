To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the background probabilities related to the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where,
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (which we want to find).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller. In this scenario, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that any attacker is 185 cm or taller, without any other information from the witness. From the text, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    - \( P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \). 
    - \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are not. Since the witness makes an incorrect judgment 20% of the time, and given that being shorter than 185 cm is the incorrect judgment here, \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
    - \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability of being shorter than 185 cm among attackers, which is 85%, or 0.85.

Thus,
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, {probability: 0.4138}.
