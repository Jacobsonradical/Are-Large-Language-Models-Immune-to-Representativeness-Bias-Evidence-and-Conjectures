To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the witness and the general statistics about the heights of attackers, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

**Let:**
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represent the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Given:**
- Prior probability \( P(H) \) (the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller): \( 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- Prior probability \( P(H') \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm): \( 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E|H) \) (the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall): \( 0.80 \) (correct identification by witness)
- \( P(E|H') \) (the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not that tall): \( 0.20 \) (witness error)

**Bayes' theorem states:**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \) (the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|H') \times P(H') \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, given the witness's statement and the distribution of attacker heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
