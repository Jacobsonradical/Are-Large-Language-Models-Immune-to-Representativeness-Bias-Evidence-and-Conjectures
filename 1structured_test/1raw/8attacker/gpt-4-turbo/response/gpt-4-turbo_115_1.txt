To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is represented as:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
where:
- \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represents the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H | W) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(W | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that any attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the data provided:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
3. \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 or taller 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
