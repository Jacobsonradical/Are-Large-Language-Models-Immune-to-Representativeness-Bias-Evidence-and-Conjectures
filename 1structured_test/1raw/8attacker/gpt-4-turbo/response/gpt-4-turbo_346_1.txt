To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let `H` be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Let `E` be the evidence provided by the witness that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find `P(H|E)`, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information:
- `P(H) = 0.5` (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly half).
- `P(¬H) = 0.5` (the population of people shorter than 185 cm is also roughly half).
- `P(E|H) = 0.8` (witness's probability of correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller).
- `P(E|¬H) = 0.2` (witness's probability of mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where `P(E)` (probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated with the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and all available data, is 0.8.

Thus we present the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.8}
