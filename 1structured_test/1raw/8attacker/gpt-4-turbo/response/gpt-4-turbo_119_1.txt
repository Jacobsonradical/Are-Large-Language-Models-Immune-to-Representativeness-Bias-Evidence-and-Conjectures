To solve this, we employ Bayes' Theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A^c) \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85, because 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are) = 0.8.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) = 0.2.

Calculate \( P(B) \) - the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Answer in the expected format:
{probability: 0.414}
