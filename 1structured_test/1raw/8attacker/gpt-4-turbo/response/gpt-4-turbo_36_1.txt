To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on incoming evidence. Here, the hypothesis \( H \) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence \( E \) is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Step 1: Define the probabilities.**

1. \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's testimony. Given that the population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).

2. \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From the data provided, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \).

3. \( P(E | H^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter. From the data provided, the witness errs 20% of the time, so \( P(E | H^c) = 0.2 \).

**Step 2: Apply Bayes' theorem.**
Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where \( P(E) \) (the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | H^c)P(H^c) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.

The answer in desired format:
{ "probability": 0.8 }
