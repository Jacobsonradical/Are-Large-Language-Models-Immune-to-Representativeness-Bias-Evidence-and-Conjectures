To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian probability to update the prior probability that an attacker's height is 185 cm or taller based on the eyewitness testimony. We'll need to calculate the posterior probability with the given information.

1. **Prior Probability** (\(P(T)\)):
   According to the data, 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter than 185 cm.
   \[P(T) = 0.15\] (Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   \[P(\neg T) = 0.85\] (Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood** (\(P(E|T)\) and \(P(E|\neg T)\)):
   A witness testified the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The witness, when tested, could correctly identify people's height 80% of the time and was incorrect 20% of the time, whether the people tested were actually 185 cm or taller, or shorter than 185 cm.
   \[P(E|T) = 0.80\] (Probability witness says 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller)
   \[P(E|\neg T) = 0.20\] (Probability witness says 185 cm or taller given they are not 185 cm or taller)

3. **Calculate Total Probability of Evidence** (\(P(E)\)):
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[P(E) = P(E|T) \times P(T) + P(E|\neg T) \times P(\neg T)\]
   \[P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)\]
   \[P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem** to find \(P(T|E)\) (Probability attacker is 185 cm or taller given witness statement):
   \[P(T|E) = \frac{P(E|T) \times P(T)}{P(E)}\]
   \[P(T|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}\]
   \[P(T|E) ≈ \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.
