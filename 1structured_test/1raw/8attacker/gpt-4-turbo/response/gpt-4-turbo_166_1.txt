To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian updating based on the evidence that we have.

Let:
- \( H \): the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): the event where the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \): Prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|H^c) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, where \( H^c \) is the complement of \( H \).
- \( P(W) \): Total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (since the witness can correctly judge height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|H^c) = 0.2 \) (since the witness incorrectly judges height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|H^c)P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

We then use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(H|W) \), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
