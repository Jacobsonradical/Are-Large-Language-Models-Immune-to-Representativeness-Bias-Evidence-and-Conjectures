To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We are given:

1. **Population proportionality**: the population below 185 cm and 185 cm or higher is roughly equal. Therefore, the prior probabilities are:
   - \( P(H < 185) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.5 \)

2. **Attacker height distribution**: 85% of attackers are below 185 cm, 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore,
   - \( P(A | H < 185) = 0.85 \) (probability of attacker being <185 cm given they are <185 cm)
   - \( P(A | H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (probability of attacker being <185 cm given they are ≥185 cm)

3. **Witness reliability**: the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. Hence,
   - \( P(W = "≥185" | H < 185) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(W = "≥185" | H \geq 185) = 0.8 \)

We are asked to calculate \( P(H \geq 185 | W = "≥185") \), i.e., the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \geq 185 | W = "≥185") = \frac{P(W = "≥185" | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W = "≥185")} \]

Where:
\[ P(W = "≥185") = P(W = "≥185" | H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) + P(W = "≥185" | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) \]
\[ P(W = "≥185") = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.8 \cdot 0.5 = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W = "≥185") = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8 (80%).

Hence, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
