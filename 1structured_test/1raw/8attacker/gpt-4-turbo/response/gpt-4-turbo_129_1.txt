To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and known statistics about attacker heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (testimony).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence (witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller) assuming the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (before the witness's testimony).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given from the information:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, where \( H^c \) indicates the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Now calculate \( P(E) \), the probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller, using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid E) \):

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and other information, is approximately 0.4138.
