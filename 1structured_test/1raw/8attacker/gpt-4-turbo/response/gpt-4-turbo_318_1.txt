To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conditions and data provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (H) is true given the evidence (E). This is what we want to find (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true. In this case, it's the probability that the witness correctly identified that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before considering the evidence. We are given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence occurring under all scenarios. It includes both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness.

We can compute \( P(E) \) using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \text{~H}) \times P(\text{~H}) \]

Where \( P(\text{~H}) \) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, 85% or 0.85, and \( P(E \mid \text{~H}) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.

Thus,

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given this evidence, is approximately 0.414.
