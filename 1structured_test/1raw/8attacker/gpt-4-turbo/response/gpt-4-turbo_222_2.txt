To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define the following events:

- Let A be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Let B be the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the information given:

- Probability of A (P(A)), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15. This is because only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller.

- Probability of A^c ("attacker is shorter than 185 cm") is 85% or 0.85.

- Probability of B given A (P(B|A)), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.

- Probability of B given A^c (P(B|A^c)), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, is 20% or 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]

We substitute the known values:
\[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the person as such, is approximately 0.4138.
