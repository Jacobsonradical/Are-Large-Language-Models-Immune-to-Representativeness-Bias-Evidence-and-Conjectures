To solve this question, we use Bayes' theorem which helps in updating the probability estimate as more evidence or information becomes available. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they really are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is \( 0.15 \) given the population and attack data.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

1. Calculate \( P(B) \):
   - Given that the witness identifies correctly 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time:
     - \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
     - \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller)
   - Since the population is roughly evenly divided with a prior probability \( P(A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

2. Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
