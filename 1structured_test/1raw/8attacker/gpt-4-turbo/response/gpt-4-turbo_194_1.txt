To solve this problem, we can employ Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

**1. Definitions:**
- Let \(H\) be the event "attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."
- Let \(W\) be the event "witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller."

**2. Prior Probabilities:**
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, half of the population is shorter than 185 cm and half is 185 cm or taller. Thus, \(P(H) = 0.5\).
- \(P(H^c)\) (probability that the event \(H\) does not occur, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is also 0.5.

**3. Likelihood of witness testimony:**
- The witness correctly judges a personâ€™s height 80% of the time. Therefore, if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness identifies him as 185 cm or taller is \(P(W \mid H) = 0.8\).
- The witness makes a mistake in judging a person's height 20% of the time. Thus, if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies him as 185 cm or taller is \(P(W \mid H^c) = 0.2\).

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \(P(W)\) (probability of the witness evidence, regardless of attacker's true height) is calculated as:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) P(H^c) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]
Now plug in values to calculate \(P(H \mid W)\):
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

**Result:**
Thus, based on the witness's identification and the given statistics, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
