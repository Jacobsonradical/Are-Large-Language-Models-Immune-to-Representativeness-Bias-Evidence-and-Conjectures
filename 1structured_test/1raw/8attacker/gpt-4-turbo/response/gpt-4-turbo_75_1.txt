To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attackers by height, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where 
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification,
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller overall.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time),
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies those shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time),
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B) \), is given by:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is \(0.414\).

Hence, the final answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
