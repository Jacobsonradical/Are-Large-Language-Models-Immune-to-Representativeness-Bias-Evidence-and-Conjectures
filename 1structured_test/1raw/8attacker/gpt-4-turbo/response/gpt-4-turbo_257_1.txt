To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15, as 85% of attackers are below 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W | H^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | H^c) \times P(H^c)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

We can calculate \( P(W) \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | H^c) \times P(H^c) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's testimony and the known base rates of attacker heights, is approximately:

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
\]

This probability is subject to change based on additional evidence or adjustments in the probabilities given the testimony accuracy.
