To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Known probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \), which is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \), which is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W \mid A) = 0.80 \), which is the probability that the witness will identify someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \), which is the probability that the witness will identify someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller.

3. **Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller and can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W \mid A) \times P(A) + P(W \mid \neg A) \times P(\neg A) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
