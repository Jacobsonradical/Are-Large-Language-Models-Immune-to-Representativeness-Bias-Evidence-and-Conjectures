To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the above conditions, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( B \) be the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people is evenly split between those shorter and taller than 185 cm).
- \( P(\text{attacker is under 185 cm}) = 0.5 \) (the complement of \( A \)).

For the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (probability that witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \) (probability that witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually under 185 cm).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A)P(\text{not } A)}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore:
