To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15, because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a tall person) is 0.8.
- \( P(\neg H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) (probability the witness mistakenly identifies a short person as tall) is 0.2.
  
Next, we compute \( P(E) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall), using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting these into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
