To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem which updates our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's use the following notation:

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   \[
   P(A) = \text{Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller} = 0.15
   \]
   \[
   P(A^c) = \text{Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm} = 0.85
   \]

2. **Likelihood** (Probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given their actual height):
   - If the person is 185 cm or taller: 
     \[
     P(B \mid A) = 0.80
     \]
   - If the person is shorter than 185 cm:
     \[
     P(B \mid A^c) = 0.20
     \]

3. **Total Probability of Event B**:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
   \]
   \[
   = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability** \( P(A \mid B) \) (Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such):
   \[
   P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

**Formatted Response**:
```
{probability: 0.4138}
