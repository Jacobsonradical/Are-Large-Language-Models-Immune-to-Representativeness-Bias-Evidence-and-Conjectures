To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given this information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
  
From the information provided:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) \), is 80% or 0.8.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, \( P(B|A^c) \), is 20% or 0.2.
- The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) \), given general population distribution and typical percentages of attackers by height, is 15% or 0.15.
- The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(A^c) \), is 85% or 0.85.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]

Substituting the numbers:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
