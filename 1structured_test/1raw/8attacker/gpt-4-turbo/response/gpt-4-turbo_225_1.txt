To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of hypothesis H (attacker is 185 cm or taller) given evidence E (witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of evidence E given hypothesis H (the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of hypothesis H (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller without considering the witness' testimony).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of evidence E considering all possibilities.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies those under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, 20% error rate).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% attackers are under 185 cm).

Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the witness, is approximately 0.41.

Thus, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.41}
