To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we apply Bayes' Theorem, given the provided data. 

1. Define events:
   - **A**: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - **B**: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - **W**: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. Known probabilities:
   - \( P(A) \) (prior probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since population is roughly equally divided into those shorter than and those taller than 185 cm).
   - \( P(B) \) (prior probability that attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5.
   - Conditional probabilities given by witness accuracy:
     - \( P(W \mid A) \) = 0.8 (probability witness identifies as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller).
     - \( P(W \mid B) \) = 0.2 (probability witness identifies as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter).

3. Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem to find \( P(A \mid W) \): 
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]

   Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid A) \times P(A) + P(W \mid B) \times P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

   Now, substituting back in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, given the witness's statement and the known witness accuracy, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
