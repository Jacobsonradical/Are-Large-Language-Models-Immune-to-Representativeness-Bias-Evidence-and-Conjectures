To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayesian probability, which involves updating our initial belief (prior probability) based on new evidence provided by the witness.

Let's denote some probabilities:
- Let \( P(T) \) be the probability of being 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( P(S) \) be the probability of being shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( P(W | T) \) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as taller given they are taller.
- Let \( P(W | S) \) be the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as taller given they are shorter.

From the given data:
1. \( P(T) = P(S) = 0.5 \) since the population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those taller.
2. \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) because the witness correctly identifies those who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
3. \( P(W | S) = 0.2 \) because the witness incorrectly identifies those who are shorter than 185 cm as being taller 20% of the time.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \times P(T)}{P(W)} \]
To find \( P(W) \), use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \times P(T) + P(W | S) \times P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's report, is:
{probability: 0.8}
