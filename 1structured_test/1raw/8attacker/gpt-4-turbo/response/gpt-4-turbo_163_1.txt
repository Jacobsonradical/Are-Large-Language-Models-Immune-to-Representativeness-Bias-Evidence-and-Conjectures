To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution of attackers, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided:
- \( P(B|A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller who is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.80,
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller who is actually shorter) = 0.20,
- \( P(A) \) (the fraction of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) = 0.15,
- \( P(\neg A) \) (the fraction of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging this back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification under these conditions is approximately 0.4138.
