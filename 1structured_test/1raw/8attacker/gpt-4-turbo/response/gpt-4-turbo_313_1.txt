To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following:

- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
1. The accuracy of the witness when evaluating whether a person is 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (True Positive: witness correctly identifies attacker as 185+ when they are)
   - \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (False Positive: witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185+ when they are not)
2. Prior probabilities based on general population and attacker statistics:
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Recalling Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, can be computed from the total probability formula:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is about 0.4138.
