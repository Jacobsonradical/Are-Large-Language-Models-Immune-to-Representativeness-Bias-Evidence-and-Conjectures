To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this scenario is stated as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (this is what we need to find).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller (correct identification rate for tall people).
- \( P(H) \) is the probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

In the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \) since accurate height identification by the witness was 80%.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.20 \) where \( H^c \) is the probability of witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when actually shorter. This is calculated based on the 20% error rate.
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).

Using these, we calculate \( P(E) \) which is the total probability that the witness reports the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
