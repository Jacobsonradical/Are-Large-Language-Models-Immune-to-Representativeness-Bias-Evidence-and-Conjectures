To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the information given and apply Bayes' theorem:

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represent the evidence provided by the witness that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that any given attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \) be the prior probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they indeed are.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not.

Based on information:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are less than 185 cm)
3. From the witness's accuracy rate, \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (80% correctly identified as 185 cm or taller) 
4. \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% incorrectly identified as 185 cm or taller)

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, compute \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.

Formatted answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
