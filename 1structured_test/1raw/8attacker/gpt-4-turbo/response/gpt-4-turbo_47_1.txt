To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the new evidence provided by the eyewitness. We are provided with the following information:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(\text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.5 \)

2. Conditional probabilities given the witness's testimony:
   - The witness says the attacker's height is \(\geq 185 \, \text{cm}\).
   - Witness's accuracy:
     - Correctly identifies whether someone is \(\geq 185 \, \text{cm}\) or not 80% of the time.
     - Probability of True Positive, \( P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.8 \)
     - Probability of False Positive, \( P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm})}{P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm})} \]

Calculating the likelihood of the witness saying the attacker's height is \(\geq 185 \, \text{cm}\):
\[ P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) + P(\text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} \,|\, \text{Witness says} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ = 0.4 / 0.5 \]
\[ = 0.8 \]

Thus, based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
