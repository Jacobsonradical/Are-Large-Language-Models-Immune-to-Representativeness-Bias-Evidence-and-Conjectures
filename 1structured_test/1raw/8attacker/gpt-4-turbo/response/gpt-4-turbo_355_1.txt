To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

1. **Let's define:**
   - \( H \): Hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( E \): Evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(H) \): Prior probability of \( H \). Given that the general population is about equally divided between those below 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(E|H) \): Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is true, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being so. From the information, this is 80%, or 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \): Probability of the evidence given the hypothesis is false, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is also 20%, or 0.2, since they err in 20% of such cases.

2. **Using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

3. **To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:**
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
   Plugging the numbers:
   \[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

4. **Now calculate \( P(H|E) \):**
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

However, we need also to consider the statistics about attackers:
   - 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
   - We know \( P(\text{Attacker} = \neg H) = 0.85 \) and \( P(\text{Attacker} = H) = 0.15 \).

Adjusting our prior probabilities (since attackers differ from the general population):
   - \( P(H) \) might be better represented as 0.15 and \( P(\neg H) \) as 0.85.

Recalculating with the revised priors:
   - \( P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \)

Thus, using the revision:
{probability: 0.4138}
