To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this situation is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the evidence by the witness.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability of randomly selecting someone from the population who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (Since the witness can correctly identify someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (Since the witness errs (wrongly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.5 \) (Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now calculate \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, considering all the information and computations:
{probability: 0.8}
