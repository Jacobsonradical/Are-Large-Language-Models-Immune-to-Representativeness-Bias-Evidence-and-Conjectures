To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. 

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm while only 15% are 185 cm or taller is irrelevant here given no attack context is provided).
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies those under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We also have:
- \( P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally divided).

Using the law of total probability for \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) P(H^c) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
Thus, the formatted answer is:

{ "probability": 0.8 }
