To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior belief about the probability of an event (i.e., the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (i.e., the witness’s testimony). The theorem is formulated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness’s testimony.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) (probability witness mistakenly identifies attacker as 185 cm or more when they are not) = 0.20.

We use the law of total probability to calculate \( P(B) \), which is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence of the witness’s testimony is approximately 0.41.

So our answer is: {probability: 0.41}
