To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). Let's label the following:

- **P(A)** = Probability that any individual attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% (due to 85% of attackers being shorter than 185 cm)
- **P(B|A)** = Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that height = 80% 
- **P(B|~A)** = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter = 20% 

We also know the general population split:
- **P(A)** = 0.15 (from statement b that 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- **P(~A)** = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We need to find **P(A|B)**, which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where **P(B)** is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to use the Law of Total Probability to find this:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|~A) \times P(~A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, back to Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
