To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and general statistics regarding attackers, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. 

Let \( A \) represent the event “the attacker is 185 cm or taller” and \( B \) be the witness event “witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.” We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the witness's reliability:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.

Now, by Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where \( P(B) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So, substituting into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.414.
