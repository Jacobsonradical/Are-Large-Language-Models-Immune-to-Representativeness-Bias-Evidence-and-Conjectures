To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidences, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Consider \( H \): the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Consider \( W \): the witness testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given from data:
- \( P(W|H) \): the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are so. From the data, this is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(W|H^c) \): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This too, from the data, is 20% (or 0.2).
- The population ratio of people below and above 185 cm is roughly equal, so \( P(H) = P(H^c) = 0.5 \).
- It's given that 85% of such attacks are by people under 185 cm. This means \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) and \( P(H) = 0.15 \), considering attackers only, which necessitates an adjustment in the typical height distribution in the attacker population.

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|H^c) \times P(H^c)} \]

Plugging in values:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and adjusted attack probabilities, is approximately 0.4138.
