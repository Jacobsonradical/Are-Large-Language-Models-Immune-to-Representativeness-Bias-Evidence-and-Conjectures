To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is used to compute the probability of a cause (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given an effect (in this case, the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( B \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probability \( P(A \mid B) \) which is given by:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

From the information:
- \( P(A) \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \) (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness' accuracy:
- \( P(B \mid A) \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \) (Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20.

Using total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.

Final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
