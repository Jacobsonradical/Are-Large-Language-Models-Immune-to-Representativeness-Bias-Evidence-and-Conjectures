To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be expressed as:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|W) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness states the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the evidence:
1. \( P(H) \) is \(\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\), as stated by the attackers tallness distribution.
2. The witness's ability translates directly into \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (correct identification when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) and \( P(W|L) = 0.2 \) (wrongly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, when they are not).

Also, \( P(L) \) which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = \( 0.5 \) (since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

\( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|L) \times P(L) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}
