To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attackers' heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayesâ€™ theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This probability, given in the problem, is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We know 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so this is 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

However, calculating \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
Where:
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that the attacker was under 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller even though they are shorter. Given the witness's error rate of 20%, this probability is 0.20.

Putting these numbers into the formulas:
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.
