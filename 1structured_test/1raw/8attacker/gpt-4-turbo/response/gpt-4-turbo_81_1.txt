To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( B \) be the event that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller." Thus, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) where \( A^c \) is the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
2. "Given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases." This means:
   - \( P(B \mid A) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller) = 0.80,
   - \( P(B \mid A^c) \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

where \( P(B) \) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is calculated by the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \cdot P(A^c) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now plugging in the values to calculate \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore:
{probability: 0.4138}
