To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence.

1. **Definitions:**
   - Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) represent the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (\( P(B|A) \)) = 80% = 0.8.
   - Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, even though they are not (\( P(B|\neg A) \)) = 20% = 0.2.
   - Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(A) \)) = 15% = 0.15.
   - Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(\neg A) \)) = 85% = 0.85.
   - \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability.

3. **Calculation of \( P(B) \):**
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.
