To estimate the probability \( P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) \) where \( H \geq 185 \) represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the remaining information from the witness and distribution is considered, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \) (the probability of \( A \) without any additional information).
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the probability of observing \( B \) given \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing \( B \).

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( H \geq 185 \)).
- \( B \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.20 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not, 20% error rate).

We need to find \( P(B) \) (total probability of the witness saying the person is 185 cm or taller), which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) P(A^c)
\]
Where \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \) (85% of such attackers are under 185 cm).

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414.
