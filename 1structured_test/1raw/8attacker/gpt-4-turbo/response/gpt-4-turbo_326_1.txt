To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote:
- \( H \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) as the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is taller) = 0.5 (since it is mentioned that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 or taller is roughly equal).
2. \( P(L) \) = 0.5 (complement of \( P(H) \)).
3. \( P(W|H) \) = 0.8 (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(W|L) \) = 0.2 (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

We wish to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Applying Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

To compute \( P(W) \) (probability witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|L) \times P(L) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Thus, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.8}
