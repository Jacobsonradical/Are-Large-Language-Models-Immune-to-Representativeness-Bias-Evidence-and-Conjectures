To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the general information about attackers, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which is the witness's identification.

From the data provided, the following probabilities are known:
- \( P(H) \) (the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's identification): approximately 0.5, since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller): 0.8.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are not): 0.2. \( H^c \) is the complement of \( H \), representing people shorter than 185 cm.

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

However, accounting for the general information about attackers, we update \( P(H) \) based on the given information: only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. This data modifies our base rates:
- \( P(H) \) becomes 0.15.
- \( P(H^c) \) becomes 0.85.

Now, we recalculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, recalculate \( P(H \mid E) \) with the adjusted prior probabilities:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, adjusted using the general population data and the witness's effectiveness, is approximately 0.414.
