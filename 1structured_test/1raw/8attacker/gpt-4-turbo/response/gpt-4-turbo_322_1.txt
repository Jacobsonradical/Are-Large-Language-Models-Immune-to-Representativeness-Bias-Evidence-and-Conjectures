To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability (before considering the witness's testimony) and the likelihoods (based on the witness's accuracy) are given.

1. **Prior probabilities (before witness's statement)**
   - \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(S) = 0.5 \) (Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood of witness's statement**
   - Witness states the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Accuracy of the witness when a person is actually 185 cm or taller: 80% (Correctly identifies \( T \) as \( T \))
     \( P(\text{Witness says } T | T) = 0.8 \)
   - Accuracy of the witness when a person is actually shorter than 185 cm: 20% (Incorrectly identifies \( S \) as \( T \))
     \( P(\text{Witness says } T | S) = 0.2 \)

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(T | \text{Witness says } T) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says } T | T) P(T)}{P(\text{Witness says } T)}
   \]
   
   To calculate \( P(\text{Witness says } T) \), we use the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(\text{Witness says } T) = P(\text{Witness says } T | T)P(T) + P(\text{Witness says } T | S)P(S)
   \]
   \[
   P(\text{Witness says } T) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]

   Plugging these into Bayes' Theorem, we get:
   \[
   P(T | \text{Witness says } T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Given this calculation, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:
\[{probability: 0.8}\]
