To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence. We start with some prior probabilities and update them using the likelihood of the new evidence under each hypothesis.

Let's define:
- \( A \) would be the event the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) would be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The population is roughly equally split between those under 185 cm and those equal to or over 185 cm. So, \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \), where \( A^c \) is the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time: \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) and \( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller, computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability estimate that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.8}
