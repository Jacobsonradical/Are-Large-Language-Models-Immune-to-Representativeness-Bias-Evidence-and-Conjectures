To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem as follows:

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \(P(A) = 0.5\) (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal, i.e., 50% each).
- \(P(A^c) = 0.5\) (probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).
- The prior probabilities for attackers (85% under 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller) imply information about typical attacker profiles, but here we need to calculate based on direct information about the height distribution in the general population and witness accuracy.

From witness's capability:
- \(P(B | A) = 0.8\) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B | A^c) = 0.2\) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate \(P(A | B)\) (probability the attacker is indeed 185 or taller given the witness identified them as such):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where \(P(B)\) (probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we substitute back to find \(P(A | B)\):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such and considering the accuracy of the witness, is 0.8.
