First, let's use the notation H to denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and H^c for the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We need to calculate P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(W|H) \): the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \): the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since attackers taller than 185 cm make up 15% of all attackers, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(W|H^c) \): the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20%, or 0.2.
- \( P(H^c) \): the prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since attackers shorter than 185 cm make up 85% of all attackers, \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).

Using the law of total probability for \( P(W) \), we have:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.413793 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414.
