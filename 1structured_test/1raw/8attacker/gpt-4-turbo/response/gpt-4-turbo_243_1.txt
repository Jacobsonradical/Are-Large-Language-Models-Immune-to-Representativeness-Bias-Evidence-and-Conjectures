To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the statistical distribution of attacker heights, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
A = attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information provided:
P(B|A) = Probability of witness identifying the person correctly as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not = 20% = 0.2

Population distribution of heights:
P(A) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = about 50% = 0.5
P(¬A) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = about 50% = 0.5

Probability distribution of attackers' heights:
Within the given population:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller

Thus:
P(A) (in the context of attacks) is not just 0.5 but is weighted by the likelihood that such individuals are attackers. Hence:
P(A) = 0.5 (normal distribution) x 0.15 (among attackers)
P(¬A) = 0.5 x 0.85

These need normalization to sum up to 1. So:
P(A | attack) = (0.5 x 0.15) / (0.5 x 0.15 + 0.5 x 0.85)
             = 0.075 / (0.075 + 0.425)
             = 0.075 / 0.5
             = 0.15

P(¬A | attack) = 0.85

Using Bayes theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where P(B) (probability of witness saying attacker is 185 cm or taller, considering all factors) can be computed by total probability theorem:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Thus:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
