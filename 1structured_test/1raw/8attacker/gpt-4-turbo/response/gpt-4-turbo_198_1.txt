To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence available, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \( H \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) denote the event where the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the data:

1. The fraction of the population 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm, thus \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and accordingly \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (where \( \neg H \) represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

2. Information "a" doesn't directly affect our calculation since it pertains to the distribution traits among attackers and does not weigh in on the specific event of the attacker's height.

3. However, given "b":
   - The witness identifies a person correctly as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they actually are 185 cm or taller: \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \).
   - The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if they are shorter: \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is \( P(H|W) = 0.8 \).

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
