To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is given by:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \(P(H \mid E)\) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence.
- \(P(E \mid H)\) is the probability of the witness evidence (witness identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) given the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(H)\) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- \(P(E)\) is the probability of the witness evidence.

Given the data:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) \), the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \), the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually aren't, is 0.2. Here \( H^c \) signifies the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

First, calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attacker heights, is approximately **0.4138** (or 41.38%).
