To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information given, a Bayesian approach can be taken. First, let's define:

- **P(T)** = Probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- **P(S)** = Probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- **P(W|T)** = Probability that a witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller.
- **P(W|S)** = Probability that a witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- **P(W|T)** = 80% = 0.8 (correct identification if truly 185 cm or taller),
- **P(W|S)** = 20% = 0.2 (incorrect identification if actually shorter),
- **P(T)** = 15% = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller),
- **P(S)** = 85% = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W|T) \times P(T) + P(W|S) \times P(S)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{(0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
