To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) = 0.15 because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
  
We also need:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are under 185 cm, which is also 20% or 0.2 (from the error rate).
- \( P(\neg A) \) = 0.85 because 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

Using the law of total probability, \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4137 \] 

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness report, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the solution can be presented as:
