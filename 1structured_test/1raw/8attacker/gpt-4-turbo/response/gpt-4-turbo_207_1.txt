To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events, and in this example, it can help us update our initial belief about the distribution of the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Let W be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:

1. P(W | H), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
2. P(W | H^c), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.2.
3. P(H), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on data about attackers, is 15% or 0.15.
4. P(H^c), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 * 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification is approximately 0.4138.
