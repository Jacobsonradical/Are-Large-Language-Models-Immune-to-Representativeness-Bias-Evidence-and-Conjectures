First, let's define some key probabilities based on the given information:

- Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg A \) represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) represent the event that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (as 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies attackers 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies attackers shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We need to estimate \( P(A | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so. Applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using this value in Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.4138.

In the requested format:
