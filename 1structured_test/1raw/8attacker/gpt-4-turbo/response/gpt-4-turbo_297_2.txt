To solve this, we will use Bayes' theorem. We can write out the relevant probabilities:

1. **P(H >= 185)**: Probability that a randomly chosen individual from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the given data, the population is evenly divided, so **P(H >= 185) = 0.5.**

2. **P(H < 185)**: Probability that a randomly chosen individual from the population is shorter than 185 cm. This is also 0.5.

3. **P(W | H >= 185)**: Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they in fact are. Given as 80% = 0.8.

4. **P(W | H < 185)**: Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the error rate, given as 20% = 0.2.

5. **P(A >= 185)**: Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, given as 15% = 0.15.

6. **P(A < 185)**: Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given as 85% = 0.85.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H >= 185 | W) = \frac{P(W | H >= 185) \times P(H >= 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where P(W) can be calculated using the law of total probability, which aggregates the probabilities of identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, both correctly and incorrectly:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H >= 185) \times P(H >= 185) + P(W | H < 185) \times P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substituting into the Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H >= 185 | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H >= 185 | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
