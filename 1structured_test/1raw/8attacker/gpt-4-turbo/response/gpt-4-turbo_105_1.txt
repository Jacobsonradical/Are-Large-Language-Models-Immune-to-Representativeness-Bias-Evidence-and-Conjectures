To solve for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem which gives us:

\[ P(Height \geq 185 | Witness) = \frac{P(Witness | Height \geq 185) \times P(Height \geq 185)}{P(Witness)} \]

Given:
- \( P(Height \geq 185) \) = Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the populations are roughly equal).
- \( P(Height < 185) \) = Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.
  
- \( P(Witness | Height \geq 185) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(Witness | Height < 185) \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.

Calculate \( P(Witness) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(Witness) = P(Witness | Height \geq 185) \times P(Height \geq 185) + P(Witness | Height < 185) \times P(Height < 185) \]
\[ P(Witness) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(Witness) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Height \geq 185 | Witness) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
