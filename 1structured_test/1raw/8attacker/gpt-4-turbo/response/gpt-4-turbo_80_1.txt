To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our beliefs about the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the new evidence provided by the witness. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm tall or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H | E) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E | H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller if they are indeed that tall, is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \), the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20%, or 0.2.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Substituting these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, there is a 41.38% probability, or approximately 0.4138 probability, that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Hence, in the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
