To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the general statistics about attackers' height, we can use Bayes' Theorem which is given as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \),
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given \( H \) is true,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) being true,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \).

From the given data:
- The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Thus, \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Hence, \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(H) \) (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller and are attackers) is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \) (the proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm and are attackers) is 85% or 0.85.

The total probability of evidence \( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414.
