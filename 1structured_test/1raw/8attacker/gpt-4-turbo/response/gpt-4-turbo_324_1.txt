To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us to update the probability estimate based on the given evidence.

**Step 1: Define the events**
Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Step 2: Use Bayes' Theorem**
Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Here:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (before considering the witness testimony). From the information, it can be assumed \( P(A) = 0.5 \) since the population is equally divided.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%, so \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is also given as 20%, so \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \).

**Step 3: Calculate \( P(B) \)**
The total probability \( P(B) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, incorporating both when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when not, can be given by:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

**Step 4: Calculate \( P(A|B) \)**
Now substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
