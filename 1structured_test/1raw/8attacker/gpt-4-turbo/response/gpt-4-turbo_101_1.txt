To solve this, let's denote the following probabilities:

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- The witness correctly identifies someone's height 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \).

We want to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. By the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore,
{
  probability: 0.414
