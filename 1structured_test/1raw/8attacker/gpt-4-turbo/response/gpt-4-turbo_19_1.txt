To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- **A**: Event where the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- **B**: Event where a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement:

- **P(A)** (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller): From the information that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we get P(A) = 0.15.
  
- **P(¬A)** (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm): From complement rule, P(¬A) = 0.85.

- **P(B|A)** (probability that witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller): The witness can correctly determine someone's height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.80.

- **P(B|¬A)** (probability that witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm): The witness erroneously identifies someone as taller 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|¬A) \times P(¬A) \]

Substituting the values we get:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now plug in the values to Bayes' formula to find P(A|B):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus:
```
{probability: 0.4138}
