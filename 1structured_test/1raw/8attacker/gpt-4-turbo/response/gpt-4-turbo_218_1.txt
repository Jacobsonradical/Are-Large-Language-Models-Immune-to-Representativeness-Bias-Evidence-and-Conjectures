To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \), the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, is 0.5 since it's stated that the population is roughly equally distributed between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller is 80%, hence \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 20% (since they identify height correctly 80% of the time), hence \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
- Here \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5 \) as previously stated.

Calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W) \):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8.

The final answer, expressed as required:
{ "probability": 0.8 }
