To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which in its simplest form states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (which we are trying to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that they actually were (the witness correctly assessing tall people, which is 80%).
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller prior to considering the witness's statement (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of actual height.

Now, let's find \( P(B) \), the overall probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability includes both scenarios where the attacker is indeed tall, and where they are not but the witness mistakenly identifies them as such:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
where \( A^c \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability the witness mistakenly identifies a non-tall person as tall (which is 20%).

From the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Plugging in these values:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
