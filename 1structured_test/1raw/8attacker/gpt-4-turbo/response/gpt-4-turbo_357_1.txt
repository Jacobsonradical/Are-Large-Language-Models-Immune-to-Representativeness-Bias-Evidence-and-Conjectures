To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is stated as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the statement of the witness.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when indeed the attacker is 185 cm or taller (given as 80% or 0.8).
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in general (given as 15% or 0.15 due to the attacker's profile statistics).
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), which can be derived as follows:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) P(H) + P(W \mid L) P(L) \]

Where:
- \( P(L) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was under 185 cm (85% or 0.85).
- \( P(W \mid L) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly judges someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (error rate of 20% or 0.2).

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
