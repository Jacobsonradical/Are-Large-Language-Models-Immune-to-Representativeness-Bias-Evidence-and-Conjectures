To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let's define \( H \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( W \) as the event "witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller".

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - According to the information given:
     - \( P(H) \) (probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15% or 0.15, since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
     - \( P(\neg H) \) (probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 85% or 0.85.

3. **Likelihood Probabilities:**
   - \( P(W | H) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that height) is 80% or 0.8.
   - \( P(W | \neg H) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter) is 20% or 0.2.

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Bayes' Theorem states:
     \[
     P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
     \]
   - Where \( P(W) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]

5. **Calculate \( P(H | W) \):**
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
