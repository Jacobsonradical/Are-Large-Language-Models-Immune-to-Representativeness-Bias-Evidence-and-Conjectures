To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayesian probability formula, which updates the probability estimate based on new evidence.

1. Let's denote:
   - P(H) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
   - P(L) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
   - P(A|H) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given their height is 185 cm or taller.
   - P(A|L) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given their height is shorter than 185 cm.
   - P(W|H) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
   - P(W|L) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.

From the problem:
   - P(H) = P(L) = 0.5 (The population is equally divided between those shorter and taller than 185 cm.)
   - P(A|H) = 0.15 (Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.)
   - P(A|L) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.)
   - P(W|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies taller individuals 80% of the time.)
   - P(W|L) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller 20% of the time.)

We want to find P(H|W), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|L) \times P(L)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8. 

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
