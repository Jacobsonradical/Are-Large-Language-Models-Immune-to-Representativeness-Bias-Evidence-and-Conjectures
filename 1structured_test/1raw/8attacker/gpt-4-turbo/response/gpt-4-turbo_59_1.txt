To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is expressed as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence or observation, in this case, the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = \( 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) (probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller) = \( 0.80 \).

We also need \( P(E \mid H^c) \) (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm):
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) = \( 0.20 \) (since the witness has a 20% error rate).

Let's calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138. In numeric format:

{probability: 0.4138}
