To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller",
- \( B \) as the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the information provided, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \), since the population is evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \), since the witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \), since the witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Bayesâ€™ Theorem tells us:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.
