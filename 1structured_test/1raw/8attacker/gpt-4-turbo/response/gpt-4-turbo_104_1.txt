To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way to find a probability when we have conditional probabilities. Bayesâ€™ Theorem is stated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) (in this context, \( A \) is 'attacker is 185 cm or taller', \( B \) is 'witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller').
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of \( B \) given \( A \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \) (in this context, the probability attacker is 185 cm or taller based initially on the fact that 15% of attackers are this tall).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of \( B \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Step 1: Assign known probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is under 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness's accuracy when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller).

Step 2: Compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \] 

Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
