To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the probability distribution of attackers' heights, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Step 1: Define the events.
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is identified as being 185 cm or taller.

Step 2: Use Bayesâ€™ Theorem.
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, when they indeed are. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that someone is identified as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
  \[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]
  where \( A^c \) is the event of being shorter than 185 cm. From the data, \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) and \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) since the witness errs 20% of the time identifying someone shorter as taller.

Calculating \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Calculating \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.

Hence, the estimated probability is:
{probability: 0.41}
