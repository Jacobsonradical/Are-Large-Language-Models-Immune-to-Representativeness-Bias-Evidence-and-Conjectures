To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the statistics about the population and attacker demographics, let's use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is represented as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represents the witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller — given as 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller — given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Now, \( P(B) \) can be broken down as follows using the Total Law of Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A') \times P(A') \]

Where:
- \( A' \) represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(A') \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm — given as 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A') \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller even though they are shorter — given as 20% or 0.2.

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Final answer: {probability: 0.414}
