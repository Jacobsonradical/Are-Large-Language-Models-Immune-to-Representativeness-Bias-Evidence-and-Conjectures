To solve this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which enables us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Here's how we can apply it in the context of the given problem:

**1. Definitions and Given Information:**

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) represent the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) represent the event that a witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (Population has equal parts shorter than and taller than or equal to 185 cm.)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller.)
- \( P(W|A^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm.)

**2. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} \]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Putting it into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

**3. Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
