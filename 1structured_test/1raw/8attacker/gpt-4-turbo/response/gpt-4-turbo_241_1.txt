To find the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in probability theory states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of \( A \) occurring given that \( B \) is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing \( B \) given \( A \).
- \( P(A) \) is the unconditional probability of \( A \).
- \( P(B) \) is the unconditional probability of \( B \).

Let:
- \( A \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter).

To find \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \times P(\text{not } A) \]
This gives:
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
