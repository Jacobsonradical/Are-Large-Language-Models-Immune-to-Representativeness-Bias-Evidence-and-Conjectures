To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two pieces of information, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H \) = attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \) = attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \) = witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = probability attacker is 185 cm or taller = \( 0.5 \) (since the population split is roughly half and half)
- \( P(\neg H) \) = probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm = \( 0.5 \)

From the data:
- \( P(W|H) \) = probability witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = \( 0.8 \) (correct identification by witness)
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) = probability witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller given attacker is shorter than 185 cm = \( 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height)

We use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we substitute into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.
