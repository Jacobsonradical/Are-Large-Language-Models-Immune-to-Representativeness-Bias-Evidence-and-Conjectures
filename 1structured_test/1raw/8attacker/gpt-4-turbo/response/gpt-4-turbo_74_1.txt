To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we have prior information about the distribution of attackers' height, and we also have information about a witness's ability to identify whether someone is 185 cm or taller.

**Step 1: Define the needed probabilities.**
- Let \(H\) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \(E\) be the event that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \(P(H|E)\), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

**Step 2: Use given information.**
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) (probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The likelihood \(P(E|H)\) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed that height) is 0.80 (The witness identifies correctly 80% of the time).
- The probability of witness's error \(P(E^c|H)\) is 0.20 (20% of the cases where the witness may wrongly identify).
- The likelihood \(P(E|H^c)\) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not) is also 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time).
- The prior probability \(P(H^c)\) (probability that a random attacker is under 185 cm) is 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

**Step 3: Calculate \(P(E)\), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, using total probability theorem.**
\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

**Step 4: Apply Bayes' theorem.**
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = \frac{12}{29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
