To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

1. Let's define:
   \( A \) = event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   \( \overline{A} \) = event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   \( B \) = event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. From the data provided:
   - The prior probabilities (based on the attacker profile):
     \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
     \( P(\overline{A}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
  
   - The likelihood of the witness's identifications:
     \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are 185 cm or taller)
     \( P(B | \overline{A}) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm)

3. We apply Bayes' theorem to compute:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | \overline{A}) P(\overline{A})
   \]
   Substituting the given probabilities:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. Now plug in all the known values into Bayes' formula:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
