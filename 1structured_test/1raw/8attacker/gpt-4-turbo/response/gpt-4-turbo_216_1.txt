Let's calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is represented as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A occurring (the attacker being 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing B given A (the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing B (the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller).

From the statement:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and the remaining 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they indeed are, is \( 0.8 \) (80% correct identification).
- \( P(B|A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is \( 0.2 \) (20% error rate in identifying those under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

The marginal probability \( P(B) \) can be calculated based on total probability formula:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' rule:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's account, is approximately 0.4138.
