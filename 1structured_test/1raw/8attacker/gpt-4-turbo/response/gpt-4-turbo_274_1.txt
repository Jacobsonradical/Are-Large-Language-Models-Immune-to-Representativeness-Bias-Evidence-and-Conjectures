To solve this problem we'll use Bayesian probability, given the conditions about attacker heights and witness identification accuracy. 

**Step 1: Definitions**
- Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**Step 2: Known probabilities**
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. The witness's performance:
   - \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem**
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where \( P(B) \) can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) \]

Plug in the known values:
\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \).

Answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
