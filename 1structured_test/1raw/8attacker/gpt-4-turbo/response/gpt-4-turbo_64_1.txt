To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and the general characteristics of attackers, we can use Bayes' rule. Bayes' rule describes how to update our probability beliefs in light of new evidence.

First, let's define events:
- \(A\) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \(B\) be the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- Probability \(P(A)\) (prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- Probability \(P(\neg A)\) (prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The conditional probabilities based on the witness's accuracy:
- \(P(B|A)\) = 0.80 (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed that tall).
- \(P(B|\neg A)\) = 0.20 (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Using Bayes' rule:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

For \(P(B)\), we can use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, given the witness's statement, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.
