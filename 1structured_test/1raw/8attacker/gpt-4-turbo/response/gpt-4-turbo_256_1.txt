To solve this problem, we employ Bayesian analysis. We use the information given about the population distribution, the error rate of the witness, and the known statistics about the attackers' heights to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following:
- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information:
- \( P(W | H) \) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are): 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(W | H^c) \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm): 20% or 0.20.
- According to prior probabilities: \( P(H) \) (population probability of being 185 cm or taller): 50% or 0.5.
- \( P(H^c) \) (probability of being under 185 cm): 50% or 0.5.
- \( P(H|A) \) (probability that attackers are 185 cm or taller, given the general attacker statistics): 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(H^c|A) \) (probability that attackers are under 185 cm): 85% or 0.85.

First, calculate the revised probabilities of someone being taller than or equal to 185 cm among attackers, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|A) = \frac{P(A|H)P(H)}{P(A)}, \]
where:
\[ P(A) = P(A|H)P(H) + P(A|H^c)P(H^c). \]

With the statistics given:
\[ P(A|H) = 0.15 \text{ (probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution)}, \]
\[ P(A|H^c) = 0.85 \text{ (probability that attacker is shorter than 185 cm)}. \]

\[ P(A) = (0.15)(0.5) + (0.85)(0.5) = 0.075 + 0.425 = 0.5. \]
Thus:
\[ P(H|A) = \frac{0.075}{0.5} = 0.15. \]

Then, use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(H|W) \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s testimony):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)}, \]
where \( P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|H^c)P(H^c) \).

\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.5) + (0.20)(0.5) = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50. \]
Then:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.5)}{0.50} = \frac{0.40}{0.50} = 0.80. \]

Consequently, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:
{probability: 0.8}
