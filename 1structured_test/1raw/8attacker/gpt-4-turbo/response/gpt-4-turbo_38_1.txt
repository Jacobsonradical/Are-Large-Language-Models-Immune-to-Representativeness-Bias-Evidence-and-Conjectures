To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (not conditioned on witness's identification). Given that the population is equally divided between those under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller and knowing that generally 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we use \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 as per the witness's accuracy.
- \( P(B | A^c) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2, the error rate of the witness.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller; it is the total probability taking into account both correct and incorrect identifications by the witness from both height groups, calculated as 
  \[ P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
  \[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the JSON formatted answer is:
