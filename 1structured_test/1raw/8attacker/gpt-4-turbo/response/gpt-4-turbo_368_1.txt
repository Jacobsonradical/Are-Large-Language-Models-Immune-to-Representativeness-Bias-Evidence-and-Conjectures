To solve this question, let's use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. **\( P(H) \)** (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (since only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. **\( P(\neg H) \)** (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Additionally, based on the witness's accuracy:
3. **\( P(E \mid H) \)** (Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is that height) = 0.80.
4. **\( P(E \mid \neg H) \)** (Probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter) = 0.20.

The total probability for the evidence \( E \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Returning to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.

Formatted answer:
{"probability": 0.4138}
