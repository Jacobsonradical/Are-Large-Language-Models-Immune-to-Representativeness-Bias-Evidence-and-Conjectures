To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we shall use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of our hypothesis (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (the witness's statement).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true (probability the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) before seeing evidence.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness's statement being what it is.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- The witness correctly identifying height is 80% (whether the person is taller than 185 cm or not), and incorrectly identifying height is 20%.

Using the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will correctly identify them as such).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (if the attacker is under 185 cm, there's a 20% chance witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller).

Therefore, we can now calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.
