To solve this problem, we'll use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs based on the evidence provided.

1. **Initial belief (Prior probability, \( P(H) \))**: 
   The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is roughly \( 0.5 \) since the population is equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.

2. **Likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis (Conditional probability, \( P(E|H) \))**:
   If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness, who is correct 80% of the time (irrespective of the height being tested), would likely identify them as such. Thus, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \), where \( E \) is the evidence/event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

3. **Likelihood of evidence given the hypothesis is false (Conditional probability, \( P(E|H^c) \))**:
   If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly judging them as 185 cm or taller. Hence, \( P(E|H^c) = 0.2 \).

4. **Application of Bayes' Theorem**: 
   Bayes' Theorem states that \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \), where \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that hypothesis H (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is true given evidence E (witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
  
   The probability of the evidence, \( P(E) \), can be calculated as 
   \[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

5. **Calculate \( P(H|E) \)**:
   \[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's account and the underlying data, is 0.8 (or 80%).
