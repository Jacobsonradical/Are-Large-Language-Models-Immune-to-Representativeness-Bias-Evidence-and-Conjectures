To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H | W) = (P(W | H) * P(H)) / P(W)

Where:
- P(H | W) = Probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- P(H) = Prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- P(W | H) = Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(W) = Total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W | H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time)
- P(W | ¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, when they are actually shorter)

P(W) can be found using:
P(W) = P(W | H) * P(H) + P(W | ¬H) * P(¬H)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Thus:
P(H | W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= ~0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Answered formally:
{probability: 0.414}
