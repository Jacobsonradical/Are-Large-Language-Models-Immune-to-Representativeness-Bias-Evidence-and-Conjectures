To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (the witness's identification).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

Given data:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller is \( 15\% \) or 0.15. 
  (From statement a: 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, hence 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) \): The probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm is \( 85\% \) or 0.85.
- \( P(E \mid H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that height is \( 80\% \) or 0.8. 
  (From statement b)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not (false positive) is \( 20\% \) or 0.2.
  (From statement b)

The probability of having this evidence (Witness identifying the person as 185 cm or taller), denoted as \( P(E) \), can be computed by considering both cases where the hypothesis is true and false:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, given the evidence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
