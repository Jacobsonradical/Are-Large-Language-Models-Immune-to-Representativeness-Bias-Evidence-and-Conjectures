To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is 

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, i.e., the witness's assertion that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's assertion.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness would assert the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller, regardless of actual height.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) as the witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, meaning she correctly identifies attackers of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \), the probability that the witness incorrectly asserts an attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. \( H^c \) stands for the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

To find \( P(E) \), the law of total probability states:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
