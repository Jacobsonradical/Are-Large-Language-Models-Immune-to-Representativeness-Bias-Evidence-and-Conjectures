To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem can be stated as:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (the witness's testimony).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

From the first piece of information:
- Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (probability that the attacker is under 185 cm).

From the second piece of information:
- \( P(E|H) \) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

The overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller (Evidence, \( E \)) is:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8. So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
