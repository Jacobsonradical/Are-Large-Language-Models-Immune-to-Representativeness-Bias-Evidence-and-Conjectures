To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's how we do it step-by-step:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and taller are roughly equal, the prior probability \( P(A) \) (probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller) is 0.5.

3. **Likelihood Probabilities:**
   - Given the witness’s effectiveness:
     - The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) \), is 0.8 (80% correct identification when 185 cm or taller).
     - The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|\neg A) \), is 0.2 (20% error rate identifying someone under 185 cm).

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' Theorem states:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.
   - The total probability \( P(B) \) of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller can be calculated using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
     \]
     Given that \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \):
     \[
     P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
     \]

5. **Calculating \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s testimony and their accuracy, is 0.8 or 80%.
