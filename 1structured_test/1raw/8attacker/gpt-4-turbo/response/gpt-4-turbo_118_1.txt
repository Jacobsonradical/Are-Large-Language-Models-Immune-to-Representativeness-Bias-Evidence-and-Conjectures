To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates conditional probabilities to prior probabilities. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:

- \( P(H) \): Prior probability (based on the composition of attackers) that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (or 15%).
- \( P(H^c) \): Conversely, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (or 85%).
- \( P(W | H) \): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (or 80%).
- \( P(W | H^c) \): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (or 20%).

We need to calculate \( P(H | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | H^c) P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness report, is approximately 0.41.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
