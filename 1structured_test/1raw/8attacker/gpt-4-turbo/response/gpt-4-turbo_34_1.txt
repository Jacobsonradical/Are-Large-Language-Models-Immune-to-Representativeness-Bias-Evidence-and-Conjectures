To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which formulaically is expressed as:

\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A \mid E) \) is the probability of an event \( A \) happening given evidence \( E \) (in this case, \( A \) is the attacker being 185 cm or taller and \( E \) is the witness's testimony).
- \( P(E \mid A) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that event \( A \) occurs.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \) occurring independent of \( E \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \) under all possible conditions.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) be the event the attacker is less than 185 cm tall. 
- \( W \) be the statement that the witness reports the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- From the problem: \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W \mid L) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(L) = 0.85 \) are the respective probabilities that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller or less than 185 cm tall.

Using these, we can calculate \( P(W) \) as follows:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, to find \( P(H \mid W) \) (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's report), we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Then,
