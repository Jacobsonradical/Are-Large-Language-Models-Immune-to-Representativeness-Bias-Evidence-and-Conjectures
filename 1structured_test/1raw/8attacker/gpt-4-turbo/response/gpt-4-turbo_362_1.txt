To solve this problem, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the key probabilities given:

1. \( P(T) \): Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller. Given the population data, \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (50% of people are 185 cm or taller).

2. \( P(S) \): Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is similarly \( P(S) = 0.5 \).

3. \( P(A|S) \): Probability that a shorter person (under 185 cm) attacks is 85%, or \( P(A|S) = 0.85 \).

4. \( P(A|T) \): Probability that a taller person (185 cm and taller) attacks is 15%, or \( P(A|T) = 0.15 \).

5. Probability witness reports 185 cm or taller given true situation:
   - \( P(W|T) \): Probability witness correctly identifies a taller person is 80%, or \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \).
   - \( P(W|S) \): Probability witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller is 20%, or \( P(W|S) = 0.2 \).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where the total probability \( P(W) \) of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) P(T) + P(W|S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

Therefore:
The answer in the stipulated format is:
{
  "probability": 0.8
