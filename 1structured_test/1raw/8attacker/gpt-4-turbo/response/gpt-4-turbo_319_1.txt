To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information above, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is given by the formula:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which includes the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of \( H \) given \( E \).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given \( H \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (the probability of being 185 cm or taller before the new evidence).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \).

According to the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since it is stated that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal).
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.5 \) (the complement of \( P(H) \)).

Compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Answer: {"probability": 0.8}
