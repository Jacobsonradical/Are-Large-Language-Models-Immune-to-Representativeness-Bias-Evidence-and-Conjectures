To solve this problem, I will use Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our prior belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. Bayes’ Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \) given that hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) occurring (prior probability).
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of observing the evidence \( E \).

1. **Define the Hypotheses and Prior Probability**:
   - Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - The prior probability \( P(H) \) (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) = 0.5. Similarly, the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is also 0.5, so \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).

2. **Assess the Conditional Probability of the Evidence**:
   - \( P(E|H) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
   - \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

3. **Calculate the Total Probability of the Evidence**:
   - \( P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)  = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5. \)

4. **Apply Bayes’ Theorem**:
   - \( P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8. \)

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’ identification, is 0.8.
