To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the base rates of height and attack probability, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, our hypothesis is that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( A \) = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \) = Witness states that attacker is 185 cm or taller

We need to estimate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony.

1. **Prior Probability \(\boldsymbol{P(A)}\)**
   - From the given information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Hence, \( P(A) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihood \(\boldsymbol{P(B|A)}\)**
   - This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller. It's given as 80%, or \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).

3. **Marginal Likelihood \(\boldsymbol{P(B)}\)**
   - This is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height.
   - Calculated as \( P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \) where \( A^c \) is the complement of \( A \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
   - The witness erring when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm is also 20%, so \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \).
   - Thus, \( P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

4. **Posterior Probability \(\boldsymbol{P(A|B)}\)**
   - Now use Bayes' theorem: \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \).
   - Plugging in the numbers: \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \).

Converting this result:

\(\{ probability: 0.414 \} \)

Thus, there's approximately a 41.4% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the combined assessment of witness accuracy and the known demographics of attacker heights.
