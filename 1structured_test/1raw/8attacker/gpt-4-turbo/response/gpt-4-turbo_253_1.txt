To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior belief about a probability based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the evidence from the witness that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- Prior probabilities: \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (the population is evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
  
- The likelihood the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that height: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
  
- The likelihood the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' Theorem gives:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8. Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
