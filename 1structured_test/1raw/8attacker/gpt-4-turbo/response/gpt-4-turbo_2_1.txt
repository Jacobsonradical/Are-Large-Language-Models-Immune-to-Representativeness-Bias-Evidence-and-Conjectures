To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15% or 0.15, since 85% of attackers are less than 185 cm tall and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are indeed that tall) is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not) is 20% or 0.2, since there is a 20% error rate in the witness's height identification.

Using the law of total probability for \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s identification, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:
{probability: 0.41}
