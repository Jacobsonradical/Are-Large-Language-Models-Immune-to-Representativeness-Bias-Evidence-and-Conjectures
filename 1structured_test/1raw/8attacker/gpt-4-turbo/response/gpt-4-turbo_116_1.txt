To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define two events:
- \( H \): The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
1. \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Assuming equal probability of being shorter or taller than 185 cm, based on the statement that the population is "roughly equal" in size for individuals shorter and taller than 185 cm.)
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) 
3. The witness has a 80% accuracy rate in identifying a person's true height, so:
   - \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, if they are.)
   - \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, if they aren't.)
4. We additionally know from other data:
   - 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so \( P(H | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) 
   - 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(\neg H | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) 

We need to find  \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified so:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, from the data provided and calculations:
{probability: 0.8}
