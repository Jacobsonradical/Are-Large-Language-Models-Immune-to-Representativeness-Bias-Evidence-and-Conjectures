To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the general attacker height distribution, we use Bayes Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the data provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (50% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (80% probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)

We also need to calculate \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(B | A^c) = 0.2 \) (20% probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being taller)

The overall probability \( P(B) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is given by the total probability formula:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now using Bayes Theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
