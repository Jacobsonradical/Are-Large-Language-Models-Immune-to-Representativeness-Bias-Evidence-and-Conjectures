To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- \( A \) represent the event that attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represent the event that the witness reports the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15. This is because 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The probability \( P(B|A) \) that the witness reports the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8. This is the accuracy rate of the witness when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- The probability \( P(B|A^c) \) that the witness reports the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is under 185 cm is 20% or 0.2. This is the error rate of the witness when the person is not 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To find \( P(B) \) (probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is about 0.4138.
