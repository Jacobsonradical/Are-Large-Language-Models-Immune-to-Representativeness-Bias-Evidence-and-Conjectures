To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event where the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information we have:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, since 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm and just 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) (the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, when they are not) = 0.20, since the witness makes an error in judgement about the height 20% of the time.

We can compute \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H)P(H) + P(W \mid H^c)P(H^c) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then, according to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) P(H)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.
