To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is written as:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We calculate \( P(W) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid L) \times P(L) \]
Where \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) and \( P(W \mid L) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller, which is 0.20.

Thus:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
