To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the witness's testimony. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) as the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
1. \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(L) = 0.5 \) (the population is evenly split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
3. \( P(W | L) = 0.2 \) (the witness falsely identifies those shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We are asked to estimate \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we apply the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging the values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:
{probability: 0.8}
