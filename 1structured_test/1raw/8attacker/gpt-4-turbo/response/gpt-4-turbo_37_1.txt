To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In our scenario, we have two pieces of key evidence:

1. The distribution of attackers by height ($a$): 85% are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. 
2. The witness's identification and its accuracy ($b$): The witness has an 80% accuracy rate for identifying the correct height category (185 cm or taller, and shorter than 185 cm) and a 20% error rate.

Let $H$ be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let $E$ be the evidence provided by the witness who says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From $a$:
- $P(H) = 0.15$ (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller without any other information).
- $P(\neg H) = 0.85$ (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From $b$:
- The witness accuracy:
  - $P(E | H) = 0.80$ (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
  - $P(E | \neg H) = 0.20$ (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find $P(H | E)$, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138, or 41.38%.

Therefore, answering according to the format specified:
{probability: 0.4138}
