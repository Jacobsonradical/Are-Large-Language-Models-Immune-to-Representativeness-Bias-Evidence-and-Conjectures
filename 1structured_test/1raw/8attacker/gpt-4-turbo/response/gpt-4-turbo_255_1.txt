To solve this question, we will utilize Bayes' theorem, which in its simplest form states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Here:
- \( A \) is the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- \( P(A) \) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal).
- \( P(B|A) \) = 0.8 (the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) \) = 0.2 (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, when they are not).

The total probability \( P(B) \) that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (whether they are or not) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \times P(\text{not } A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8. This means the estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
