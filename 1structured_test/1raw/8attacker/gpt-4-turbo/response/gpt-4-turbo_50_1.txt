To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayesian probability updates with the given data.

1. **Initial Assumptions (Prior Probabilities):**
   - **P(Tall)**, or the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, is initially derived from the statement that such attackers constitute about 15% of cases.
   - **P(Short)**, or the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85%. 
   
   \[P(Tall) = 0.15\]
   \[P(Short) = 0.85\]

2. **Witness Testimony Reliability (Conditional Probabilities):**
   - If a person is tall (>=185 cm), the witness correctly identifies them as tall 80% of the time.
   - If a person is short (<185 cm), the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time.
   
   \[P(Witness\_says\_Tall | Tall) = 0.8\]
   \[P(Witness\_says\_Tall | Short) = 0.2\]

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem helps us update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, the evidence is the witness's testimony that the attacker was tall.

   \[P(Tall | Witness\_says\_Tall) = \frac{P(Witness\_says\_Tall | Tall) \times P(Tall)}{P(Witness\_says\_Tall)}\]

   To find \(P(Witness\_says\_Tall)\), use the law of total probability:

   \[P(Witness\_says\_Tall) = P(Witness\_says\_Tall | Tall) \cdot P(Tall) + P(Witness\_says\_Tall | Short) \cdot P(Short)\]
   \[P(Witness\_says\_Tall) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\]

   Now plug the values into Bayes' formula:

   \[P(Tall | Witness\_says\_Tall) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138\]

Thus, based on the information given and Bayesian updating, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414 (41.4%).

Therefore, the answer is: 
```
{probability: 0.414}
