To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available data, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis (H) is true given the evidence (E).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence (E) given that the hypothesis (H) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the initial (or prior) probability of the hypothesis being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

From the given:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) because the population is equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (or 0.8).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% (or 0.2).

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we compute:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
