To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the data provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here are the key elements needed for the calculation:

1. **\( H \): Hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
2. **\( \neg H \): Hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.**
3. **\( E \): The evidence (witness's statement) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**

From the information provided:
- The probability that a person randomly chosen from the population (prior probability) is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is 0.5 (since it's given that the population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- The probability that the attacker, in general, is 185 cm or taller given they are an attacker, based on crime statistics, \( P(H | A) \), here \( A \) stands for being an attacker. According to the information provided, it is stated that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H | A) = 0.15 \).
- Given similar nighttime conditions, the witness can correctly identify a person being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time if they truly are, which is \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \).
- The probability of falsely identifying a person being 185 cm or taller when they are not is also provided. If a person is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, which is \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \).

We need to find \( P(H | E) \) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness has identified them as such.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless if they actually are or not, can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Substituting in the known values:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \)

\[ P(E) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification under those conditions, is 0.8 or 80%. This calculation directly assumes the witness's accuracy is the most relevant factor, overriding any general statistics about attacker height distribution.

Hence, the estimate is:
{probability: 0.8}
