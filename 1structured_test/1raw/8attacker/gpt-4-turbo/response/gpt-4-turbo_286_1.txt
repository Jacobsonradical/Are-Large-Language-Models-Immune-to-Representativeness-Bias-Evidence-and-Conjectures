To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context allows us to update our prior belief about the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the new evidence provided by the witness.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given in the text:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter).

We are seeking \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the calculated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41.
