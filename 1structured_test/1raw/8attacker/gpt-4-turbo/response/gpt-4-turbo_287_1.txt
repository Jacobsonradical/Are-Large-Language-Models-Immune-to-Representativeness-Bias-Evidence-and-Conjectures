To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this case helps us update our beliefs about the height of the attacker given the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

1. The witness's ability is such that \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \).

2. The population split:
   - \( P(H) = 0.50 \) since half of the population is 185 cm or taller, and half isn't.
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.50 \) for the same reason.
   
3. The second piece of information indicates that 85% of similar attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, we know that attack probability doesn't correlate directly with population height proportion:
   - \( P(A|H) = 0.15 \) where \( A \) is the event of attacking.
   - \( P(A|\neg H) = 0.85 \).

We need to resolve using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.50 + 0.20 \times 0.50 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.50}{0.50} = 0.80 \]

This indicates that given the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker indeed is 185 cm or taller is 0.80, based solely on population and witness accuracy data.

However, accounting for the crime statistics provided:
\[ P(H|A) = \frac{P(A|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(A) = P(A|H) \cdot P(H) + P(A|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \times 0.50 + 0.85 \times 0.50 = 0.075 + 0.425 = 0.50 \]

Now using Bayes for attack statistics:
\[ P(H|A) = \frac{0.15 \times 0.50}{0.50} = 0.15 \]

Combining both witness's testimonial accuracy and attack statistics using Bayes again:
\[ P(H|W,A) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H|A)}{P(W|A)} \]
\[ P(W|A) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H|A) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H|A) \]
\[ P(\neg H|A) = 1 - P(H|A) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(W|A) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging back in:
\[ P(H|W,A) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

However, for simple interpretation derived from initial data:
\[ \text{probability: 0.80} \]

(Note: The final result was simplified assuming witness testimony strongly influences our belief, although in real calculations, crime statistics could alter this estimation considerably, as shown above.)
