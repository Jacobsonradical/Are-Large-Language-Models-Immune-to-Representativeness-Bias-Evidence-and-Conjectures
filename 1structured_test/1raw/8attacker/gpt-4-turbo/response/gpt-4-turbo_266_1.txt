Let's denote:
\( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
\( W \) as the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
\( P(W | H) = 0.80 \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller given that the person truly is.
\( P(W | H^c) = 0.20 \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter.

Additionally, based on population information, the ratio between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is about equal, hence
\( P(H) = 0.50 \) and \( P(H^c) = 0.50 \).

In crimes, however, the percentages differ:
85% of such attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Thus:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(H^c) = 0.85 \]

We are to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating \( P(H | W) \):
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s testimony is approximately 0.4138.

In standard probabilistic notation:
{probability: 0.4138}
