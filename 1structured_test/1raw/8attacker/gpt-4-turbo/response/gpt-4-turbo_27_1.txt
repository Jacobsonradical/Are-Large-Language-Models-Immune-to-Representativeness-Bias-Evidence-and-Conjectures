To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, let's use Bayes' theorem.

Let H be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller", and let W be the event "witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We know that:
- P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is about the same).
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller).
- P(W|H^c) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

We need to compute P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We need P(W), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.8.
