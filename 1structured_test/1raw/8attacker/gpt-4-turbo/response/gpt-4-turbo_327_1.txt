To solve this, we can use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs about the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that a witness identified him as such. 

Here are the steps broken down:

1. **Prior Probability (P(T))**: From the information provided:
   - Half the population is under 185 cm and half is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( F \) that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Therefore, \( P(T) = 0.5 \) and \( P(F) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihoods**: 
   - From a: 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, \( P(F|A) = 0.85 \) and \( P(T|A) = 0.15 \), where \( A \) is the event of being an attacker.
   - From b: The witness's ability to identify someone as 185 cm or taller is 80% accurate and errs 20% of the time:
     - \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
     - \( P(W|F) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

3. **Bayes' Rule Application**:
   - \( P(T|W) \) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
   - Using Bayes' rule: \( P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \)

4. **Calculating \( P(W) \)**, the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F) \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \)
   - \( P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \)

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - \( P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \)

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
