To address this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( L \) as the event "attacker is under 185 cm."
- \( E \) as the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the given information:

- \( P(H) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, prior to the witness's testimony, is 0.5 (similar population sizes of those under and over 185 cm).
- \( P(L) \), the probability the attacker is under 185 cm, prior to the witness's testimony, is also 0.5.
  
- Given \( P(E|H) \), the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|L) \), the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are under 185 cm, is 20% or 0.2 (error rate).

We use Bayes’ Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

The denominator, \( P(E) \), can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|L) P(L) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, plug values into Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
