To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we will use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Our objective is to calculate \( P(H \mid W) \), where:

- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the evidence provided by the witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Given by the problem, \( P(H) = 0.15 \), since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being that tall. Given by the problem, the witness identifies height correctly 80% of the time, so \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness reporting that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This includes both the correct and incorrect identifications by the witness.
  
First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H)P(H) + P(W \mid H^c)P(H^c) \]
- \( P(H^c) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being less than 185 cm, hence \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is a false positive. As per problem statement, the witness identifies height incorrectly 20% of the time, so \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.20 \).

Calculation:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
