To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( E \) as the evidence, i.e., the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Based on provided information:

1. \( P(E|H) \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller) = 80% or 0.8.
2. \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are under 185 cm) = 20% or 0.2.
3. \( P(H) \) (prior probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15% or 0.15, since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(\neg H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm) is 85% or 0.85.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness' testimony, is approximately 0.4138, or about 41.38%.

**Formal response:**
{probability: 0.4138}
