To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Given by "a", we know that 15% of attackers are this height. So, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that height. According to "b", this is 80%, or \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \).
  
We also need:
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) is the probability that the witness inaccurately identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to "b", this misjudgment happens 20% of the time. Therefore, \( P(W \mid H^{c}) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(H^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. It's \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).

Using the law of total probability, \( P(W) \) (the total probability that witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus: {probability: 0.4138}
