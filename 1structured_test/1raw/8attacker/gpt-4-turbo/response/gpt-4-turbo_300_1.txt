To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (what we want to find).
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker indeed is 185 cm or taller. From the given data, this is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(B) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the first piece of information, 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(B) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(A|B^c) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the given data, this would be the error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(B^c) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

To find \( P(A) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller, we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(A) = P(A|B) \times P(B) + P(A|B^c) \times P(B^c) \]
\[ P(A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem, we find:
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B|A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.414. Therefore the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
