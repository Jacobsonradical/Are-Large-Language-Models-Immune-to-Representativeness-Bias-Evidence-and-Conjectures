To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Based on the problem:
- \( P(A) \): the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% as a decimal).
- \( P(B) \): the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.

From the witness's assessment:
- \( P(W|A) \): the probability that witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(W|B) \): the probability that witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2.

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now substitute back to find \( P(A|W) \):
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414.
