To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given these two pieces of information, we use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs (the prior probability) based on new evidence (the witness’s testimony). 

Let's define:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we know:
1. The prior probabilities based on population data:
   \[ P(H) = 0.5 \]
   \[ P(\neg H) = 0.5 \]
   Where \( \neg H \) means the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. The probability distribution of attackers' heights among past attackers (which might not be relevant for the population but potentially biases the witness):
   \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
   \[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]
   However, we will use the general population distribution, \( P(H) = 0.5 \), for our prior.

3. The witness’s reliability:
   \[ P(W|H) = 0.8 \] (80% correct identification when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \] (20% incorrect identification when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting in Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.
