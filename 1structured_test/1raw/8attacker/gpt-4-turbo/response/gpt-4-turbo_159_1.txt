To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence, we use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B = The witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

1. **Prior probability**: \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given the information "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm", it implies that \( P(A) = 0.15 \) since \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) where \( A^c \) = attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Conditional probabilities**:
   - \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies such people 80% of the time, so \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
   - \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This also happens 20% of the time, so \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \).

3. **Total probability of B (witness's identification as 185 cm or taller)**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification under the provided conditions, is approximately \( P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \).
