To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let’s denote:

H = Hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
E = Evidence that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We need to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

1. **P(H)** is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, informed by statement "a". Given that 85% are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:
   \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
   
2. **P(E|H)** is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. From "b", the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
   \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
   
3. **P(E|¬H)** is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not. This also from "b", as the witness errs 20% when they are shorter than 185 cm:
   \( P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \)

4. **P(¬H)** is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
   \( P(¬H) = 0.85 \)

Now calculating \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|¬H) \times P(¬H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we apply Bayes’ Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore:

{"probability": 0.4138}
