To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the base rates of both height in the attacker population and the accuracy of the witness, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given the evidence \( E \) (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness says so).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given the hypothesis \( H \) (probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

From the information:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The total probability of observing the evidence, \( P(E) \), can be obtained by the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Hence, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
