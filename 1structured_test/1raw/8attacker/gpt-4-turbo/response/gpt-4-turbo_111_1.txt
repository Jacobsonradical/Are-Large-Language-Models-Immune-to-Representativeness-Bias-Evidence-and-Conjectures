To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Based on point "b" this is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed that tall, which is 80% or 0.8 (as per point "a").
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is calculated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid L) \times P(L) \]
- \( P(W \mid L) \) is the probability of mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter. From point "a", this would be 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(L) \) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, this is 85% or 0.85 (as per point "b").

Now, plug in these values:
- \( P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \)
- \( P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \)
- \( P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's statement and given probabilities, is approximately **0.414**.
