To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence (E) is the witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness will correctly say the attacker is 185 cm or taller when this is true, which is given as 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given by the statistic that 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so 0.15.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of whether it is true or false.

To find \( P(E) \), we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | ¬H)P(¬H) \]
where:
- \( P(¬H) \) is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E | ¬H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when this is false, given by the 20% error rate, so 0.20.

Plugging in these values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Returning to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is about 0.414.
