To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \( P(H) \), the probability of a person (and thus an attacker) being 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.5 \) because the population is equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. However, 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Thus, if we consider only attackers, \( P(H) \) as per attacker data is \( 0.15 \).
3. A witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. From the witness's performance data,
   - \( P(W|H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(W|H^c) \), the probability of mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, is \( 0.2 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|H^c) P(H^c)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now use Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[
\{ "probability": 0.4138 \}
\]
