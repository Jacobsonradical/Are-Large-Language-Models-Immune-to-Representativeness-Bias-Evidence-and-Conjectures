To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. The theorem is expressed mathematically as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) represents the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of \( A \) given \( B \), which we want to find.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing \( B \) given \( A \), which here is \( 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifying a tall person).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of \( A \), \( 0.15 \) (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall.

Additionally, \( P(B) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]

Here:
- \( \neg A \) is the event where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is \( 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of observing \( B \) given \( \neg A \), which is \( 0.20 \) (the error rate of the witness).
- So, \( P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \).

Apply these numbers into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
