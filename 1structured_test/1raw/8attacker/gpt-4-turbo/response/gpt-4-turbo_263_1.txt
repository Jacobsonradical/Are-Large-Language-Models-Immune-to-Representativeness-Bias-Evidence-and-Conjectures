To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using this provided information, I will use Bayes' theorem, which mathematically computes probabilities given some prior knowledge and updated evidence. The formula is as follows:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (before considering the witness's testimony).
- \(P(E \mid H)\) is the probability of the evidence (witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the evidence occurring (probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(H \mid E)\) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's break down the values:
1. \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people taller and shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal).
2. \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
3. \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
4. \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Now, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the witness's identification and given information, is:
