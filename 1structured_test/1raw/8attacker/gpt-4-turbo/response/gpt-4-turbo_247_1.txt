To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Specifically, we want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (event A) given the witness's testimony (event B). 

Let:
- \( A \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) be the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( B \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( B^c \) be the event the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) from the dataset showing 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller and 85% are shorter.
- \( P(B \mid A) = 0.80 \) and \( P(B^c \mid A) = 0.20 \) since the witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.20 \) and \( P(B^c \mid A^c) = 0.80 \) since the witness incorrectly identifies those shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
= (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
= \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, conditioned on the witnessâ€™s testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
