To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the statistical distribution of attackers by height, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s testimony.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, i.e., 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which needs to be calculated using the law of total probability.

Step 1: Calculate \( P(W) \)
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Step 2: Calculate \( P(H \mid W) \)
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the demographics of attackers is approximately 0.4138. For the required format:
