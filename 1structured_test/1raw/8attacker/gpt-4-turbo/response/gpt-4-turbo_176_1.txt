To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using the given information, we apply Bayes’ theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence. In this case, our prior is the likelihood that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \) (where \( H \) represents being 185 cm or taller):
   - Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Witness’s accuracy**:
   - The witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Probability the witness is correct given the person is 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|H) \) = 0.80.
   - Probability the witness is correct given the person is under 185 cm, \( P(W|\neg H) \) = 0.20, reflecting that they’re wrong in this scenario since they said the opposite.

3. **Prior probability of being under 185 cm** \( P(\neg H) \):
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging back into Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414. 

Formally, this would be:

{probability: 0.414}
