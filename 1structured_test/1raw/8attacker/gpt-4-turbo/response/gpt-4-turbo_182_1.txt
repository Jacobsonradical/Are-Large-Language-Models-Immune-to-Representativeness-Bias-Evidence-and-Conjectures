To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here's how it works:

1. **Define the events**:
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Define the probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is initially \( 0.15 \) because 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm (implying 15% are 185 cm or taller as given in part "a").
   - \( P(B|A) \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) is \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is under 185 cm) is \( 0.2 \).
   - \( P(\neg A) \) (the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is \( 0.85 \).

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem**:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

4. **Calculate \( P(B) \)**:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

5. **Plug in to Bayes' theorem**:
   \[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

6. **Probability estimate**:
   The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.41.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.41}
