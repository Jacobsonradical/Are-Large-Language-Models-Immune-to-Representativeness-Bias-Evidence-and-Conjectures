To solve the problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \( H_T \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_S \) represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_{\geq} \) represent the event that the witness identifies the person as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally divided between those shorter and taller than 185 cm)
- \( P(H_S) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W_{\geq} | H_T) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_{\geq} | H_S) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

From Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[ P(H_T | W_{\geq}) = \frac{P(W_{\geq} | H_T) P(H_T)}{P(W_{\geq})} \]
where:
\[ P(W_{\geq}) = P(W_{\geq} | H_T) P(H_T) + P(W_{\geq} | H_S) P(H_S) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H_T | W_{\geq}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

However, we also have the evidence about attackers:
- The given data that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This represents a base rate for attackers, distinct from the general population distribution.

To use this information:
- Change the base rates \( P(H_T) \) and \( P(H_S) \) to 0.15 and 0.85 respectively, as it pertains to attackers.
  
So now, recalculating \( P(W_{\geq}) \) with these probabilities:
\[ P(W_{\geq}) = P(W_{\geq} | H_T) P(H_T) + P(W_{\geq} | H_S) P(H_S) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H_T | W_{\geq}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement and the additional information on attacker height distribution results in:
{probability: 0.4138} or approximately 0.41.
