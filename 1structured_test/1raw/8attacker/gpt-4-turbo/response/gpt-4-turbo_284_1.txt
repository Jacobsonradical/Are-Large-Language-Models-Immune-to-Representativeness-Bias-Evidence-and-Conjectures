To answer this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the likelihood of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence provided (the witness's statement). 

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

From the first piece of information:
- \( P(A) \) (prior probability that attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A^\complement) \) (prior probability that attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

From the second piece of witness's testimony:
- \( P(B \mid A) \) (probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall) = 0.8.
- \( P(B \mid A^\complement) \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

We want \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^\complement) \times P(A^\complement)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting everything back into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[
{\text{probability:} \; 0.414}
\]
