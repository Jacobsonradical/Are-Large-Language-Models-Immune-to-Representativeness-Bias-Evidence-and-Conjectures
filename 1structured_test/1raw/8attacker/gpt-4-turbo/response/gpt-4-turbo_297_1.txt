To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference based on the information provided. Here's a step-by-step calculation using Bayesian updating:

Let:
- \(H\) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(E|H)\) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller) is 80% or 0.8.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm) is 20% or 0.2.

From the information, we have that:
- 15% of attackers (regardless of witness testimony initially) are 185 cm or taller, hence \(P(H) = 0.15\).
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\).

We can calculate \(P(E)\), the probability of the evidence being that the attacker is observed to be 185 cm or taller by the witness by law of total probability:
\[P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.\]

We then use Bayes' theorem to update our belief of \(H\) based on the evidence \(E\):
\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138.\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
