To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The witness can either correctly or incorrectly identify a person's height. So, for a person who is 185 cm or taller:
- The probability of being identified correctly as such (True Positive) is 80%, i.e., \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- The probability of not being identified as 185 cm or taller (False Negative) is 20%, i.e., \( P(B^c|A) = 0.2 \).

For a person shorter than 185 cm:
- The probability of being identified mistakenly as 185 cm or taller (False Positive) is 20%, i.e., \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).
- The probability of being identified correctly as under 185 cm (True Negative) is 80%, i.e., \( P(B^c|\neg A) = 0.8 \).

According to the first piece of information:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of a person (attacker) being 185 cm or taller, based on the attack statistics, is 15% \(\Rightarrow P(A) = 0.15\).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is 85% \(\Rightarrow P(\neg A) = 0.85\).

We start with Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where \( P(B) \) represents the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated via the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using these values, we find:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4137931
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
