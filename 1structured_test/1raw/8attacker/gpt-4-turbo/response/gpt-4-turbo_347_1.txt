To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem. Let:
- H be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- W be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given:
1. P(H) = 0.5 (because heights are evenly divided in the population).
2. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
3. P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
- \( P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|~H)P(~H) \)
- \( P(~H) = 0.5 \) (similar reasoning to P(H))

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying these figures to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8, or 80%.

However, we have additional information about the general probability of attackers' heights:
- "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller".
This information suggests P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 0.85 (regarding attackers specifically, not the general population).

We need to re-evaluate using these attacker-specific base rates:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|~H)P(~H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the identification by the witness and taking into account the typical distribution of attacker heights, is about 0.414 (41.4%). 

**Answer**: {probability: 0.414}
