To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the notation we will use:

- Let \( A \) denote the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Let \( B \) denote the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the problem statement, we gather:
1. The prior probability \( P(A) \), i.e., the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, is roughly 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is equal).
2. The conditional probability \( P(B \mid A) \), i.e., the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that height, is 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time).
3. The conditional probability \( P(B \mid A^c) \), i.e., the probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller even though they aren't, is 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

We need \( P(B) \) to complete this calculation, which we find using the law of total probability:

\[
P(B) = P(B \mid A) \times P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \times P(A^c)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, substitute back into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8. In a numerical format:
