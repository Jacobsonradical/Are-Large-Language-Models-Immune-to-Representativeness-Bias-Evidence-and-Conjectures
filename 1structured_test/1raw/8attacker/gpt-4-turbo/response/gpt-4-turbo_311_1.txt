To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's denote the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as H and the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as E.

Here are the parts needed for Bayes' Theorem:
1. **P(H)**: The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly evenly split, P(H) = 0.5.
2. **P(E|H)**: The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time. Thus, P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. **P(E|¬H)**: The probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. If the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(E|¬H) = 0.2.
4. **P(¬H)**: The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. P(¬H) = 0.5.

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]

Plugging in the values, we get:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format would be:
{probability: 0.8}
