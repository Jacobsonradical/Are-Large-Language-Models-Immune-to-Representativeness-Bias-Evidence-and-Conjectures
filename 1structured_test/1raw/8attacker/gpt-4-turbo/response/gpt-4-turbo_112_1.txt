To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the details from statement "a" and statement "b", we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony).
- \(P(A)\) is the probability of being 185 cm or taller, without considering the witness's testimony.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker really is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From statement "a":
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

From statement "b":
- \(P(B|A) = 0.8\) (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(B|A^c) = 0.2\) (since the witness incorrectly states the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(A^c) = 0.85\) (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm tall)

Calculating \(P(B)\), the total probability of the witness stating that the attacker is at least 185 cm:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, our estimate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
