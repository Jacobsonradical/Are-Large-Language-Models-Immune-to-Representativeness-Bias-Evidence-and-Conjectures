To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian probability and conditional probability based on the given information. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is under 185 cm,
- \( W \) as the witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Based on the information given:
1. The probability of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller from the population, \( P(H) \), is approximately \( \frac{1}{2} \) because the number of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is nearly equal.
2. From the crime statistics given, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they have attacked someone, \( P(H | \text{attacker}) \), is quite different. It was stated that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, \( P(H | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \).
3. The witness's accuracy, \( P(W | H) \), meaning the probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller if they actually were, is 80%; and \( P(W | \neg H) \), the probability the witness would mistakenly identify someone as 185 cm or taller when they were not, is also 20%.

We are tasked to find the posterior probability \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's account.

Use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller, i.e.,
  \[
  P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
  \]

Calculating this, we get:

- \( P(H) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( P(\neg H) = \frac{1}{2} \),
- \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \),
  
Therefore:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, plugging everything back into Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statement is 0.8.
