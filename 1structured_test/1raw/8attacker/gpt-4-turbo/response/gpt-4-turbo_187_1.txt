To solve this probability problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps in updating our probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence, which is the witness's identification of the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the data:
1. \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Population equally divided, so prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller is 0.5).
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (Probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm).
3. Take \( I \) as the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's accuracy:
   - \( P(I|H) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are).
   - \( P(I|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{P(I|H) P(H)}{P(I)}
\]
We need to find \( P(I) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(I) = P(I|H) P(H) + P(I|\neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]
So,
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Therefore, the estimate is:
