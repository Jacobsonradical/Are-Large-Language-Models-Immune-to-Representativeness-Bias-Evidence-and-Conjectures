To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Based on the provided information:
- The population is divided into approximately equal parts of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. Thus, the prior probability \( P(A) = 0.5 \), and \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \) where \( A^c \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \), and incorrectly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are not, \( P(B \mid A^c) = 0.2 \).

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such \( P(A \mid B) \) can be calculated as:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) \cdot P(A^c)}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5}
\]

\[
P(A \mid B) = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
