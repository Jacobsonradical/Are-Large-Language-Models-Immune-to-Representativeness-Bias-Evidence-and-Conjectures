To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attackerâ€™s height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given data:
1. \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(H^c) \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85 since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
3. \( P(E|H) \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall) is 0.8.
4. \( P(E|H^c) \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not that tall) is 0.2, since there is a 20% error rate.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c)
= (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29
\]
Now applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
