To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating the probability estimate for a hypothesis (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given in the problem:
- The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based purely on the crime statistics (prior probability of \( A \)), \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies the taller group 80% of the time).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller who is actually shorter, \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies the shorter group as the taller 20% of the time).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138 \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is approximately 0.41. So we can present the answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.41}
