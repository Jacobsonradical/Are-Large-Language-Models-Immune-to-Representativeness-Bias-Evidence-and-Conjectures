To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's account and knowledge about the attackers' height distribution within the population, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem is given as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (as per witness's correctness rate).
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that a random person (or attacker in this case) is 185 cm or taller. From the population distribution, we know this is 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be computed using total probability theorem.

Using the total probability theorem:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
Here:
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability a random person (or attacker) is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Therefore:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.414.
