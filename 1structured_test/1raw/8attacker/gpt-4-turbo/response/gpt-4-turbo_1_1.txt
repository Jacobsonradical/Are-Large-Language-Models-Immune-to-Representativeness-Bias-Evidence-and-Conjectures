To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statement, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(A\) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg A\) be the event that the attacker's height is under 185 cm.
- \(W\) be the event that a witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

We know:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(\neg A) = 0.85\) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The witness:
- Identifies the person as 185 cm or taller rightly 80% of the time when they actually are (True Positive): \(P(W | A) = 0.80\).
- Mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not (False Positive): \(P(W | \neg A) = 0.20\).

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness statement is:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A)P(A)}{P(W | A)P(A) + P(W | \neg A)P(\neg A)}
\]
Substituting the values we know:
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85}
\]
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
\]
\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
