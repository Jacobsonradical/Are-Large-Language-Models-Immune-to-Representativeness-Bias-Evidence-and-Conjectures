To solve this problem, we can apply Bayesian reasoning. We start with the prior probabilities and then update them based on the evidence provided by the witness.

Let's use the following notations:
- \( H \) denotes the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \text{not } H \) denotes the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( W \) denotes the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is approximately \( 0.5 \) because "the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size."
- The prior probability \( P(\text{not } H) \) is \( 0.5 \).

Given the witnessâ€™s reliability:
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller \( P(W | H) \) is \( 0.8 \).
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, when they are not (\( P(W | \text{not } H) \)), is \( 0.2 \).

We are asked to estimate \( P(H | W) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \times P(H) + P(W | \text{not } H) \times P(\text{not } H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.
