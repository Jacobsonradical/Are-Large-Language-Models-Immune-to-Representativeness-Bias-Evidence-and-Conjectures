To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( H_1 \)) given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_1 | E) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (the witness testifies so),
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence (the witness testifying the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

Given information:
- \( P(E | H_1) \) = 0.80 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(E | H_0) \) = 0.20 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller), where \( H_0 \) is the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H_1) \) = 0.15 (15% chance that an attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(H_0) \) = 0.85 (85% chance that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Now calculating \( P(E) \) (probability of witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(E | H_0) \times P(H_0) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
