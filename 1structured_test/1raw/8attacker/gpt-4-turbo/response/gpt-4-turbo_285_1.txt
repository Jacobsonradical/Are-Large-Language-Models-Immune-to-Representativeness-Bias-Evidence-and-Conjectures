To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of \( A \) given \( B \), i.e., the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of \( B \) given \( A \), i.e., the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is noted as 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, initially estimated from the crime data as 15% or 0.15 because 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, combining both correct and incorrect identifications.

To calculate \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
where:
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Thus:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.
