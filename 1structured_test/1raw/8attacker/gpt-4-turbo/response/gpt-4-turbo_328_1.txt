To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information (a and b), we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define \( A \) as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and \( W \) as the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller". We need to compute \( P(A \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

1. **Given prior probabilities (from "a")**:
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \] (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(\neg A) = 0.85 \] (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

2. **Accuracy of witness (from "b")**:
   - The witness correctly identifies someone's height 80% of the time.
   - This means:
     \[ P(W \mid A) = 0.8 \] (probability witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)
     \[ P(W \mid \neg A) = 0.2 \] (probability witness incorrectly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

3. **Bayes' Theorem** states:
   \[
   P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of witness identifying attacker as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W \mid A) \times P(A) + P(W \mid \neg A) \times P(\neg A)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Plugging into Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
