To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define the following:

- Let **A** be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- Let **B** be the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

**Given data:**
- The population is divided into two equal groups: under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.5.
- The witness's ability to correctly identify someone as being 185 cm or taller or under 185 cm is 80%. Hence, P(B | A) = 0.8 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller) and P(B | A^c) = 0.2 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given they are under 185 cm).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | A^c) \times P(A^c) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Thus,
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

**Answer:**
{"probability": 0.8}
