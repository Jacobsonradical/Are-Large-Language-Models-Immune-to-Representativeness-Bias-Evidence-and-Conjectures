To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witness and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represent the evidence provided by the witness who testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness reports the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller without any additional information.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness reports the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \) because the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \) because the witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) because only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, based on the population of attackers.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.

We also need \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \}
\]
