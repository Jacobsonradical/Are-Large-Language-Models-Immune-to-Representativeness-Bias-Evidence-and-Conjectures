To find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller;
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information given ("The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size."), \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are told the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, therefore \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they are not. We are told the witness errs 20% of the time, therefore \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \).
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, therefore \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification and the given probabilities, is 0.8.

Final estimate:
{probability: 0.8}
