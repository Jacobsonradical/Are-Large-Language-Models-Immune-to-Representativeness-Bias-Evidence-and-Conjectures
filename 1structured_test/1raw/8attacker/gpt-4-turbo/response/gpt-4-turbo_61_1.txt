To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief about the distribution of attackers' heights and the witness testimony will serve as the new evidence.

**Step 1: Establish the prior probabilities.**
From the information given:
- The population of people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Hence, the prior probability \(P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.5\)
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so \(P(\text{Attacker} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.85\)
  This implies \(P(\text{Attacker} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.15\)

**Step 2: Set up conditions based on the witness's testimony.**
- The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height. Thus:
  - \(P(\text{Witness} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.8\)
  - \(P(\text{Witness} | \text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.2\)

**Step 3: Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.**
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
- \( A \) is the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( B \) is the event where the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{Witness}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \times P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm})}{P(\text{Witness})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Witness}) \) (the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be computed via the Total Probability Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Witness}) = P(\text{Witness} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \times P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) + P(\text{Witness} | \text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) \times P(\text{Height} < 185 \text{ cm}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

So,
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{Witness}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.
