To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem given the witness's testimony and the general statistics about the attackersâ€™ heights.

Let:
- \(A\) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \(B\) be the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the data provided:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(A^c) = 0.85\) (probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(B|A) = 0.8\) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(B|A^c) = 0.2\) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)}
\]
Plugging in the numbers we get:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.
