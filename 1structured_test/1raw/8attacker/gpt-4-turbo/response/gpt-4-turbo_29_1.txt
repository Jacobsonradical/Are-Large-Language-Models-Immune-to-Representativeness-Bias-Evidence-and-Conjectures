To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps in updating our prior belief based on new evidence. We can define:

- \( P(A) \): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- \( P(B) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A|B) \): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such (posterior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg A) \): the probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm.

From information "a," since the population and the attackers aren't linked by how representative the attacker proportions are of the general population, it's reasonable to start with the assumption:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)

From information "b," we have:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (ability of the witness to correctly identify someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (probability of incorrectly identifying someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
where:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]
So, substituting these into Bayes' Theorem gives:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
