To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the general statistics about attackers' heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our prior belief about a situation based on new evidence. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define events:**
   - Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (50% chance, since the population is equally divided).
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (50% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
   - According to the problem, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, i.e.,
     - \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness says '185 cm or taller' given the attacker is indeed that height).
     - \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability witness says '185 cm or taller' even if the attacker is shorter; this is the error rate).
   - It is given that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, but these represent the general statistic of attackers' heights over all cases, not conditioned on witness statements.

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem states that:
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)}
   \]

   Here,
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | H) P(H) + P(W | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]

   Therefore,
   \[
   P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Given these calculations, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is \( 0.8 \), or 80%.

Thus, the required probability estimate is:

  "probability": 0.8
