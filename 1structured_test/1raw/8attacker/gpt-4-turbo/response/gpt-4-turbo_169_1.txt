To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the height of the attacker given the witness's identification.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( B \) be the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the problem:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller before knowing the witness's testimony) is 0.15 (as given, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The complement of \( A \), \( P(A^c) \), (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) \), is 0.80.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, \( P(B|A^c) \), is 0.20.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) (probability witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|A^c) P(A^c) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85)
\]
Calculate \( P(B) \):
\[
P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, and under the conditions provided, is approximately 0.4138.

Result in expected format:
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
