To solve this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context would help us update our beliefs about the height of the attacker based on the witness's testimony.

Let \( H \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( W \) be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since it's stated that the population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ 
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]
\[ 
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5)
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Plugging the values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus, based on the given information and the witness's identification, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
