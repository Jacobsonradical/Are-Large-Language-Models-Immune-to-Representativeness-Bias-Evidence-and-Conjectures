To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:
- The witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (\( P(W|H) = 0.8 \)).
- The witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not (\( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \)).
- The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is 15% of attackers (\( P(H) = 0.15 \)).
- The prior probability of someone being under 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) \), is 85% of attackers (\( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We calculate \( P(W) \) (probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute these values into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.414}
