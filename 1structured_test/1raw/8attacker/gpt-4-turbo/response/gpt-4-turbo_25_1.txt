To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event the witness testified the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability (the basic rate of the population that is 185 cm or taller attackers), given as 15% of attackers, thus \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, thus \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \).

We are given that the witness correctly identifies:
- someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they actually are (\( P(B | A) = 0.8 \)).
- someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually not (\( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \)).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

To get \( P(B) \), the probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller or not, we use the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \times P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138. This can be rounded and presented as requested:

{probability: 0.414}
