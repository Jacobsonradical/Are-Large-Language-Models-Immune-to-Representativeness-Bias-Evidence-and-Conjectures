To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so (posterior probability).

As provided:
- The population equal in size for <185 cm and >=185 cm. Thus, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We first calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

So the formatted answer would be:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
