To calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the available information, we use Bayes' theorem:

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (what we want to find).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the prevalence of such offenders which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate using total probability theorem.

First, let's calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

where:
- \( P(A^c) \) is the probability of a random attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, which is 20% or 0.2.

Put the numbers in:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
