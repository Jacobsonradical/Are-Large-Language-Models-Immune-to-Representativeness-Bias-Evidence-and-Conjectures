To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) - Prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(\neg H) \) - Prior probability that the attacker's height is under 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) - Likelihood of the evidence (witness identification) given attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness identifies correctly 80% of the time, so it is 0.8.
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \) - Likelihood of the evidence given attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The witness makes a mistake 20% of the time, so it is 0.2.
- \( P(E) \) - Total probability of the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller), calculated via the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, let's apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

The calculated probability is approximately \( P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \).
