To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that a witness claimed the attacker was at least that tall, we can use Bayesian probability. Let's follow these steps:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let's denote \( H \) as the event that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - **\(\Pr(H)\)**: The probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller. From the data, we know "the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size". Thus, \(\Pr(H) = 0.5\).
   - **\(\Pr(\bar{H})\)**: The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm. This should also be \(0.5\).
   - **\(\Pr(W \mid H)\)**: The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 80%, or 0.8.
   - **\(\Pr(W \mid \bar{H})\)**: The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This probability is 20%, or 0.2.

3. **Using Bayes’ theorem:**
   - Bayes' formula is: 
   \[
   \Pr(H \mid W) = \frac{\Pr(W \mid H) \cdot \Pr(H)}{\Pr(W)}
   \]
   - \(\Pr(W)\) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   \Pr(W) = \Pr(W \mid H) \cdot \Pr(H) + \Pr(W \mid \bar{H}) \cdot \Pr(\bar{H})
   \]
   \[
   \Pr(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]
   - Thus, plugging into Bayes' formula gives:
   \[
   \Pr(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.

Therefore, our answer is \( \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \).
