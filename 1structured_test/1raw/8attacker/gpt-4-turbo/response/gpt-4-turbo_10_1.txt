To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate on the basis of new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represent the witness's statement that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, is \( 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid H) \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are, is \( 0.80 \), (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is \( 0.20 \) (since the witness errs 20% of the time in such cases).

We apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Rounded to a reasonable precision:
\[ \text{{probability: 0.414}} \]

This is the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.
