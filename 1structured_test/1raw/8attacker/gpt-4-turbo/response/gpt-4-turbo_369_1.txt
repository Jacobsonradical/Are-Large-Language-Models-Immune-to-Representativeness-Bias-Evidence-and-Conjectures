To solve this problem, we use Bayesian probability, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Initially, let's define the following:

- **H**: Hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- **E**: Evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- The probability of a randomly chosen attacker being 185 cm or taller because of the overall population distribution is \(P(H) = 0.5\) (due to equal population distribution of less than and more than 185 cm).
- The probability that witnesses say an attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, is \(P(E | H) = 0.8\) (witness is correct 80% of the time).
- The probability that witnesses say an attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, is \(P(E | H^c) = 0.2\) (witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

We need to calculate \(P(H | E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now plug these values into Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

However, we have another important piece of information regarding the general proportion of attackers taller and shorter than 185 cm:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, which redefines \(P(H)\) and \(P(H^c)\):
  - \(P(H) = 0.15\) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - \(P(H^c) = 0.85\) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Recalculate \(P(E)\) with these new probabilities:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Then recalculate \(P(H | E)\):
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Based on this calculation, the revised probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness’s statement and the general proportions of attacker heights, is about 0.4138.

Therefore, our answer is:
{
  "probability": 0.4138
}
