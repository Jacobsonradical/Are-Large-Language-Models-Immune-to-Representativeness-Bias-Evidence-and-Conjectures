To calculate this probability, we can employ Bayesian statistics using the provided information. We have the following:

- Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Given:
1. The probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), is 0.5 (since the population is evenly divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
2. The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H \mid \text{attacker}) \), is 0.15.
3. The witness's probability of correctly identifying a person's height, \( P(W \mid H) \), is 0.8.
4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person's height who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, \( P(W \mid \neg H) \), is 0.2.

Firstly, under the assumption of independence between offenders' heights and probability of offending, the relevant probability to be updated is \( P(H) \), the prior probability.

We need to update this using Bayes' Rule, which tells us how to update our beliefs (prior probabilities) in the light of new evidence:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
