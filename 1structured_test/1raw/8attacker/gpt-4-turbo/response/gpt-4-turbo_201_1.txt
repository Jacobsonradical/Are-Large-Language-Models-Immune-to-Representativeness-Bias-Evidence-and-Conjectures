To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information and witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony.
- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on general information about attacker distribution.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the data provided:
\( P(A) = 15\% = 0.15 \) because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
\( P(B|A) = 80\% = 0.8 \) because the witness correctly identifies attackers as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are actually that tall.
\( P(B|A^{\complement}) = 20\% = 0.2 \) because the witness incorrectly identifies attackers as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter.

\( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller, can be computed from the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^{\complement}) \times P(A^{\complement}) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness evidence is approximately 0.414.
