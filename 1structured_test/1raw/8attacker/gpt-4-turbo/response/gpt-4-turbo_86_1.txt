To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the witness testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) be the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is true.
- \( P(W \mid H^c) \) be the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is not true (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H \mid W) \) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (as 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (as 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies a person being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid H^c) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly judges a person who is shorter than 185 as taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W \mid H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
