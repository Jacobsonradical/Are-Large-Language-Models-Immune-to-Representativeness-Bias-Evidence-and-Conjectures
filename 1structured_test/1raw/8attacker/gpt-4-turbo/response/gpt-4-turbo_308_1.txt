To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, without witness identification.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem details:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% under 185 cm).

The total probability \( P(E) \), that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = 0.4138
\]
