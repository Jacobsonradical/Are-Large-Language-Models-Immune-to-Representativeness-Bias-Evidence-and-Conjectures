To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the statistics provided, we can use Bayesian probability.

Let's define the following:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence, in this case, the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

From the given information:
- The base rate \( P(H) = 0.5 \) since the population of people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller are roughly equal.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. From the data, the witness correctly identifies height (whether short or tall) 80% of the time. Since there's no suggestion that the witness is better at identifying one group over another, we use this same accuracy for identifying tall individuals: \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(E \mid H^c) \) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is the error rate, which is given as 20%: \( P(E \mid H^c) = 0.2 \).

According to Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is:
