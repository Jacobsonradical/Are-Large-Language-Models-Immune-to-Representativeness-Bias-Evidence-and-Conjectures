To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define the following:

- Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E \) denote the evidence that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The population probability \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since the population of individuals shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal).
- The probability that a given attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) \), given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we still consider this prior probability to be 0.5 (since no specific information on the difference in distribution between general population and attackers is mentioned).
- The probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller \( P(E|H) \) (probability of evidence given the hypothesis is true) = 0.80 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time).
- The probability of incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller \( P(E|\neg H) \) (probability of evidence given the hypothesis is false) = 0.20 (witness erred in 20% of the cases, i.e., incorrectly identifying those who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
Substituting the values we know:
\[
P(E) = (0.80)(0.5) + (0.20)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]
So, updating our probability using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.80
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification under those conditions, is 0.80.
