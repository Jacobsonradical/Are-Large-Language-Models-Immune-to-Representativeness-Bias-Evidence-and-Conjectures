To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can utilize Bayesian probability concepts.

From the data:
- Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(T) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(T^c) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
- The witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time (whether they are above or below 185 cm), thus, we have probabilities:
  - Probability witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are (True Positive), P(W|T) = 0.8
  - Probability witness says attacker is less than 185 cm given they are not (True Negative), P(W^c|T^c) = 0.8
- However, we need the probabilities of the witness being wrong:
  - Probability witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are not (False Positive), P(W|T^c) = 0.2
  - Probability witness says attacker is less than 185 cm given they are (False Negative), P(W^c|T) = 0.2

We are asked to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
Let's denote:
- W as the event the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W|T) \times P(T) + P(W|T^c) \times P(T^c)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414 (41.4%).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
