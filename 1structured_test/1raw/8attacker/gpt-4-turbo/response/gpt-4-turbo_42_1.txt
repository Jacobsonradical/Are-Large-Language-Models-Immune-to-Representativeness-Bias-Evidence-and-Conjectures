To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(H\) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) is the event that a witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
  
From the information given:
- \(P(H)\) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 15%, as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Thus, \(P(H) = 0.15\).
- \(P(H^c)\) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 85%, or \(P(H^c) = 0.85\).

We are also told the witness's accuracy:
- \(P(W|H)\) (probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are indeed 185 cm or taller) is 80%, so \(P(W|H) = 0.8\).
- \(P(W|H^c)\) (probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are under 185 cm) is 20%, so \(P(W|H^c) = 0.2\).

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we first need \(P(W)\), which can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|H^c) \times P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be about 0.4138.
