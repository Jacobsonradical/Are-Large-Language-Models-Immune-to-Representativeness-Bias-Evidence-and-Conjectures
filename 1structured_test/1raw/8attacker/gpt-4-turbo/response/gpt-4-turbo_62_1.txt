To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is given by:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | W) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.
- \( P(W | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the problem, since attackers 185 cm or taller make up about 15% of occurrences, this is 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we utilize the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H)P(H) + P(W | ¬H)P(¬H) \]

Here:
- \( P(W | ¬H) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (false positive), which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(¬H) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in these values yields:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is about 0.414. 

The final answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
