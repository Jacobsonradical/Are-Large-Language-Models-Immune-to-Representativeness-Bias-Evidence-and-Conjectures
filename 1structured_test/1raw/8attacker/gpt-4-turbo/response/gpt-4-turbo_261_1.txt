To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(H\) represents the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) represents the evidence provided by the witness that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(H \mid E)\) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence.
- \(P(E \mid H)\) is the likelihood of the witness accurately judging the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of the witness reporting that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \(P(E \mid H)\) = 0.80 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
2. \(P(E \mid \neg H)\) = 0.20 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
3. \(P(H)\) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
4. \(P(\neg H)\) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

The total probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.414. In the specified output format:

{probability: 0.414}
