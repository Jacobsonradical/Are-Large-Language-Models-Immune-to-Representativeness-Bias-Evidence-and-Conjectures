To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate for this case based on the new evidence provided by the witness.

1. **Define the Events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Because the population of people below and above 185 cm is roughly equal, \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
   - \( P(B \mid A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall. According to the data, this is 80%, or \( 0.8 \).
   - \( P(B \mid A^c) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. This error occurs 20% of the time, or \( 0.2 \).

3. **Bayes’ Theorem:**
   - Bayes' theorem states: 
     \[
     P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}
     \]
   - Here, \( P(B) \) (the total probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be computed using the law of total probability:
     \[
     P(B) = P(B \mid A) P(A) + P(B \mid A^c) P(A^c)
     \]
     Plugging in the values, we get:
     \[
     P(B) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
     \]

4. **Calculate \( P(A \mid B) \):**
   - Substitute back into Bayes’ theorem:
     \[
     P(A \mid B) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8
     \]

**Conclusion:**
The estimate of the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is \( 0.8 \) or 80%. 

Thus, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.8}
