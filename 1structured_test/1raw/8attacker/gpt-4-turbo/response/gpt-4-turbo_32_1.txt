To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on additional evidence. Let:

- A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- B = Witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, assess the initial probabilities (priors):
- P(A) = Probability of a random person (attacker) being 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal).
- P(A^c) = Probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.

From the witness's reliability:
- P(B|A) = Probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- P(B|A^c) = Probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not = 0.2.

We previously have information about the typical heights of attackers:
- P(A|attacker) = The probability a random attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- P(A^c|attacker) = The probability a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.

However, in applying Bayes' theorem here, we need to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's statement rather than general statistics about attackersâ€™ heights. So, we begin with the basic population prior:

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so and considering the witness reliability but not initially factoring the specific attacker height distribution, yields:
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, provided the witness's statement, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
