To arrive at the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information provided:
1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \), since it's given that the population is equally divided between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \), the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
3. \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \), the likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not (i.e., if the person is under 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c)
\]
Since \( P(A) = P(A^c) = 0.5 \), we have:
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the information given and the witness's identification, is 0.8.
