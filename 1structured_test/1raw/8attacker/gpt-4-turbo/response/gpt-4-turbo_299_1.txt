To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- H be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- L be the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm,
- W be the event the witness testified that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

- \( P(H) \), the prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(L) \), the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm), \( P(L) = 0.85 \).

The witness's accuracy is given as:
- Correctly identifies true height (whether 185 cm or taller) 80% of the time,
- Incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time.

Thus:
- \( P(W | H) \) (probability witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 80% or 0.8,
- \( P(W | L) \) (probability witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 20% or 0.2.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the overall probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Putting these into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \]

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
