To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witness.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, i.e., 15% (or 0.15) as given in statement "a".
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. From statement "b", we know the witness is correct 80% of the time, i.e., 0.8.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is computed using the law of total probability:
  - \( P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
  - \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% (or 0.85) as given in statement "a".
  - \( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is again 20% error rate as given in statement "b", i.e., 0.2.

Plugging in these values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

This means that there is approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the previously known statistics about attackers' heights. For the answer format:
