To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we use Bayes' theorem, which is defined as follows:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the initial probability of the hypothesis (prior probability).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given from the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{not }H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
  
The witness's accuracy:
- Witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \)
- Witness falsely identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: \( P(E|\text{not }H) = 0.2 \)

Now compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|\text{not }H) P(\text{not }H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
