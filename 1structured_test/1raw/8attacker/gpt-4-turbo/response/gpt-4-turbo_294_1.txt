To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events for our scenario:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Based on the given information:
- \( P(A) \) (probability attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since the population is equally divided)
- \( P(\neg A) \) (probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5
- \( P(B|A) \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they indeed are) = 0.8
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not) = 0.2

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is computed as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.8}
