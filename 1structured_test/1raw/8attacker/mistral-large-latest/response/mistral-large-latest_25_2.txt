To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rates of attackers' heights and the witness's accuracy.

Let's define the following:
- \( P(S) \) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(T) \) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|S) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (20% error rate)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy rate)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
