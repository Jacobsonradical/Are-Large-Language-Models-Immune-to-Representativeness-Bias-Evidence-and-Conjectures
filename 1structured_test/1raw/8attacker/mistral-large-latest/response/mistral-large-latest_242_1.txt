To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
4. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Given \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
