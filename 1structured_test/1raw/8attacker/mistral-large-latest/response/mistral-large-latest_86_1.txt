To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
