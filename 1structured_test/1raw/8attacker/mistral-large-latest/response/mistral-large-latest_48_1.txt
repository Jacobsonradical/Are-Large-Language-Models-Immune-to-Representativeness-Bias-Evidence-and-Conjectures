To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's calculate the individual probabilities:

- \( P(A) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.20.
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
