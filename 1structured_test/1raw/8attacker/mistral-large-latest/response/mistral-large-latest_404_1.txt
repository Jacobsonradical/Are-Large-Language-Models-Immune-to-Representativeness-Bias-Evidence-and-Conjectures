To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
   - 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
   - 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

   Therefore, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

2. **Witness Testimony**:
   - The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.
   - The witness errs 20% of the time.

   Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to update our prior probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability = 0.15).
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (prior probability = 0.85).
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80%).
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20%).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
