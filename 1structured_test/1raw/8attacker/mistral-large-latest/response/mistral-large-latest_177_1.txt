To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the base rates of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are not.
- \( P(W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
