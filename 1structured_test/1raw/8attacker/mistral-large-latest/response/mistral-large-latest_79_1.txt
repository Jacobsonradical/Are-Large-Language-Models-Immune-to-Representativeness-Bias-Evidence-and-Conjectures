To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

From statement (a), we know:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

From statement (b), we know:
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
- The witness errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our belief based on the witness's testimony.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm)

First, calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|W) \):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
