To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided:

1. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.20).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
