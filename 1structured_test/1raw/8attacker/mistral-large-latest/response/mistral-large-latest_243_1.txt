To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided:

1. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population is roughly equal in size between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
3. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(B) \), we need to consider both true positives and false positives:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Calculating \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
