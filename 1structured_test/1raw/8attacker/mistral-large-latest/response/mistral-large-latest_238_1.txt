To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The probability of an attacker being under 185 cm is 85%, so \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \).
2. The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%, so \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
3. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) and \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
