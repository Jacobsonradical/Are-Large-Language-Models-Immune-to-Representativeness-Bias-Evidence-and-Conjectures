To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the base rates of attackers being shorter or taller than 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as tall.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as tall, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
