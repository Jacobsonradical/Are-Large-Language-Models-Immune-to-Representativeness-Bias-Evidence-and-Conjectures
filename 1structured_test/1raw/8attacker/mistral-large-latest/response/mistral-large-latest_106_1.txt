To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

Let's denote:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
