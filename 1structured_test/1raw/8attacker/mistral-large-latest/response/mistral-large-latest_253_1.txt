To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.5 \)

2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{not } A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \)

3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
   - \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(B \mid \text{not } A) = 0.2 \)

We want to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A \mid B) \):

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
