To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability of the attacker's height and the witness's reliability.

Given:
- The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (0.15).
- The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85% (0.85).
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.

Let's use Bayes' theorem to update our belief based on the witness's testimony.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the event that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

First, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
