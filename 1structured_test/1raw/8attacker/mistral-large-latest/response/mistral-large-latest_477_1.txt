To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.

First, calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
