To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's define the probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \{
    \text{probability}: 0.4138
  \}
}
\]
