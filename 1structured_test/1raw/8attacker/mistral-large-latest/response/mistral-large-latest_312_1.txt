To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rates of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (The witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (The witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
