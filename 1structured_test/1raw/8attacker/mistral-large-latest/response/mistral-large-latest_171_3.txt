To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information given.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
2. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

We can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be broken down into two parts:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \boxed{\text{{probability: 0.4138}}} \]
