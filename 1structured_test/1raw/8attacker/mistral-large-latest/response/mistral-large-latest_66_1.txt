To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A | B) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A | \neg B) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B) = 0.15 \) (The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg B) = 0.85 \) (The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(B | A) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(A) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(A) = P(A | B) \cdot P(B) + P(A | \neg B) \cdot P(\neg B) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(A) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(A) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(A) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B | A) \):

\[ P(B | A) = \frac{P(A | B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} \]
\[ P(B | A) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(B | A) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{
\text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
