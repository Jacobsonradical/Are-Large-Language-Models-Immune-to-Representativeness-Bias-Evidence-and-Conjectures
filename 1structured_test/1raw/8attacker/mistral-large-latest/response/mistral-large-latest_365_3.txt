To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided:

1. The population distribution and the likelihood of attackers being under or over 185 cm.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying height.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The witness's accuracy:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
