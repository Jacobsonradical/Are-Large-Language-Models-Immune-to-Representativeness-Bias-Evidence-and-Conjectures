To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
1. The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is under 185 cm)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, we calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
