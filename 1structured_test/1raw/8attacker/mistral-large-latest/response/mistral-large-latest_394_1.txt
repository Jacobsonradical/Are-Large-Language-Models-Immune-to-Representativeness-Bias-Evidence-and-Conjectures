To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rates of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|A) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|B) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\text{{probability: 0.4138}}
\]
