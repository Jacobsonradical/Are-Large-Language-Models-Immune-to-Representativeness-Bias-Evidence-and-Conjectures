To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, we know from information (a) that:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Next, from information (b), we know that:
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.
- The witness errs 20% of the time.

Given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability that this identification is correct.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
