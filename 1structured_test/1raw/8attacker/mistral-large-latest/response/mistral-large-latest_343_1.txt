To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided about the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers by height.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.414}} \]
