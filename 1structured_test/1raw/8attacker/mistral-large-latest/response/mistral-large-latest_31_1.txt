To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (The probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\text{{probability: 0.4138}}
\]
