To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rates of attackers' heights and the witness's accuracy.

Given:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is under 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
