To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)

2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)

3. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
   - \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \)

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
