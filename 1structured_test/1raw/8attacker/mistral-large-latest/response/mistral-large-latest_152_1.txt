To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
2. \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
3. \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 \):

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.8}} \]
