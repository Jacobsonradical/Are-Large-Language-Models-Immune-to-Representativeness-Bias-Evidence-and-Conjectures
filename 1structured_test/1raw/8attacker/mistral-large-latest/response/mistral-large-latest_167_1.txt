To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \):
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:
\[ \{\text{probability: } 0.4138\} \]
