To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
   \[
   P(A) = P(\text{not } A) = 0.5
   \]

2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
   \[
   P(A) = 0.15
   \]

3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
   \[
   P(B | A) = 0.80
   \]
   \[
   P(B | \text{not } A) = 0.20
   \]

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(B) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \( P(A | B) \):

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A | B) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed { \text{probability: 0.4138} }
\]
