To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided:

1. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population is roughly equal in size between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
3. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies tall attacker)
- \( P(W | S) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies short attacker as tall)

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
