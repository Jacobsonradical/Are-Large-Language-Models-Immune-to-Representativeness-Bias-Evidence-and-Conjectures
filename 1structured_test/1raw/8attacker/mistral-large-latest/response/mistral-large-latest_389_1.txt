To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A|S) \) as the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(A|T) \) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. \( P(S) = P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size).
2. \( P(A|S) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(A|T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
5. \( P(W|S) = 0.2 \) (the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
