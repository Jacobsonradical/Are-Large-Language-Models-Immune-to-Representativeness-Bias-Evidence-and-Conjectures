To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \):
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
