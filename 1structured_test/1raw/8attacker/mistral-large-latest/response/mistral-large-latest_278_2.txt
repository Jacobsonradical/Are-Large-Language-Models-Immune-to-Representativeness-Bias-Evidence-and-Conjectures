To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \) (since \( A^c \) represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \boxed{0.8} \]

So, the answer in the required format is:
\[ \{\text{probability: } 0.8\} \]
