To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote:
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)

Next, we consider the witness's testimony:
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.
- The witness errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|S) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{0.4138}
\]

So, the answer is:
\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
