To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
2. \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
3. \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Given \( P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 \):

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.8}} \]
