To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.

Now, let's calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
