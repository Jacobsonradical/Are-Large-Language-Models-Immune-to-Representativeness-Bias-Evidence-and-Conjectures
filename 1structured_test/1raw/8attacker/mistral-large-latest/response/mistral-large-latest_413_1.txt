To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

From (a), we know that:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

From (b), we know that the witness:
- Correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
- Errs 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is under 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)

So:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
