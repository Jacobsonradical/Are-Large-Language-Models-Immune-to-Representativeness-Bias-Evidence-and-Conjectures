To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from both statements.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From statement (a), we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size).
- \( P(\text{attacker is under 185 cm}) = 0.5 \).

From statement (b), we have:
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.
- The witness errs 20% of the time.

So, we can write:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is under 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A) \cdot P(\text{not } A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.8\} \]
