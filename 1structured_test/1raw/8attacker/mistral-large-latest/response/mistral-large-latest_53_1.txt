To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

1. **Information (a)**:
   - The population is roughly equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
   - 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
   - 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

2. **Information (b)**:
   - A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
   - The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
