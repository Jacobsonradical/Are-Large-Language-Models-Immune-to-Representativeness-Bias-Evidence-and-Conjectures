To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A | B) \):

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{0.4138}
\]

So, the answer in the requested format is:

{
  "probability": 0.4138
