To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information given in parts (a) and (b).

From part (a), we know:
- The probability of an attacker being under 185 cm is 85% (0.85).
- The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (0.15).

From part (b), we know:
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time (0.80).
- The witness errs in identifying the height 20% of the time (0.20).

Let's denote:
- \( P(A) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \):
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 80% (0.80).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually under 185 cm. This is 20% (0.20).

Now, calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
