To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.
2. The witness's accuracy in identifying height, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
