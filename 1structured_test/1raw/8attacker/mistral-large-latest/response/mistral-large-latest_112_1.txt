To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)

2. 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\neg A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \)

3. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
   - \( P(B \mid A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(B \mid \neg A) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A \mid B) \):

\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.4138}}
}
\]
