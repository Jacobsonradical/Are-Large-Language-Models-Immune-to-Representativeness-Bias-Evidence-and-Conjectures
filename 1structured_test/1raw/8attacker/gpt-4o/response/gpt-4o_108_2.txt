Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We already know:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally divided)
- \( P(T | \text{crime}) = 0.15 \) (prior probability given the crime statistics)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \)

To find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:
