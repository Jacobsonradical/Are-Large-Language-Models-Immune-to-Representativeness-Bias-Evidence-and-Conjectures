To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. Here's how you can solve this step-by-step:

### Defining Terms:
1. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. Let \( W \) be the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

### Given Information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(L) = 0.5 \). (Population distribution)
- \( P(attack | H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(attack | L) = 0.85 \). (Attack likelihood based on height)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W | L) = 0.2 \). (Witness's identification accuracy)

### Bayes' Theorem Component:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | L) \cdot P(L) \]

### Calculating Components:
1. **Calculating \( P(W) \):**
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

2. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

### Final Probability:
{probability: 0.8}

Thus, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
