To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is roughly equal)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A | W) \):

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is

\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
