We can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height given the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
- \( P(T) = P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (population is equally divided in terms of height)
- \( P(\neg T | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- \( P(T | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness accurately identifies height for tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness misidentifies shorter people as tall 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

First, we calculate the combined prior of \( T \) and \( \neg T \) for attackers:
\[
P(T) = 0.15, \quad P(\neg T) = 0.85
\]

Now we use Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(T|W) \):
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \}
\]
