We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Let \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Let \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(E \mid H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E \mid H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

We want to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), which is given by Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( P(E) \), \( P(E \mid H_1) \), and \( P(H_1) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
