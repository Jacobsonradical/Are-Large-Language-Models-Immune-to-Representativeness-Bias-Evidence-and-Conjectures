To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller attacker 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

First, we compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
