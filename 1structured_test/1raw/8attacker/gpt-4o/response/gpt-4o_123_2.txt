To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T_0 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

1. The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(T_1) \)) is 0.5, and likewise, the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(T_0) \)) is also 0.5.
2. Given that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies this with an 80% probability (\( P(W \mid T_1) = 0.8 \)), and incorrectly identifies this with a 20% probability (\( P(W \mid T_0) = 0.2 \)).
3. Given that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness correctly identifies this with an 80% probability (\( P(\neg W \mid T_0) = 0.8 \)), and incorrectly identifies this with a 20% probability (\( P(\neg W \mid T_1) = 0.2 \)).

We need to find \( P(T_1 \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(T_1 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T_1) \cdot P(T_1)}{P(W)} 
\]

Where the total probability \( P(W) \) is given by:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W \mid T_1) \cdot P(T_1) + P(W \mid T_0) \cdot P(T_0) 
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) 
= 0.4 + 0.1 
= 0.5 
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(T_1 \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} 
= \frac{0.4}{0.5} 
= 0.8 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.

Therefore, the final answer is:

{probability: 0.8}
