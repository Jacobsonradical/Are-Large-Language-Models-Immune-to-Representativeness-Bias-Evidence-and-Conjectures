To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

1. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(H | W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We need \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H | W) \):
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
