To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's identification). We can organize the information as follows:

- \(P(H_1)\): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \(P(H_2)\): Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \(P(E|H_1)\): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- \(P(E|H_2)\): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm

From the given information:
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\(P(H_1)\)) = 15% or 0.15
- Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\(P(H_2)\)) = 85% or 0.85
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller (\(P(E|H_1)\)) = 80% or 0.80
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (\(P(E|H_2)\)) = 20% or 0.20

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85} \]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

\[ Numerator = 0.80 \times 0.15 = 0.12 \]

\[ Denominator = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
