To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg T\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we establish our prior probabilities:

- \(P(T) = 0.5\): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg T) = 0.5\): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Next, we incorporate the witness's accuracy:

- \(P(W | T) = 0.8\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W | \neg T) = 0.2\): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \(P(T | W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \(P(W)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
