To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is well-suited for this type of problem.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) : The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T | W) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

### Given Data:
1. \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person
2. \( P(W | T^C) = 0.20 \) - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller
3. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) - Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability)
4. \( P(T^C) = 0.85 \) - Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (prior probability)

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) * P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) * P(T) + P(W | T^C) * P(T^C) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.80 * 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (41.38%).

### Final Result:
{probability: 0.414}
