To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|\neg A) = 0.2 \)

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = 0.8 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.8\}
