To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The relevant probabilities are:

- \( P(A) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|A) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|B) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller given that the attacker is shorter.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \)

We want to find the probability \( P(A|W) \), where \( W \) denotes that the witness identified the attacker as taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
