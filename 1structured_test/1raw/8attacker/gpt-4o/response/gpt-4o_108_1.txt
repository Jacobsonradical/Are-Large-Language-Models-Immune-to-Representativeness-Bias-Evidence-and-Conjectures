To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we list the probabilities given in the problem:

1. \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
2. \( P(T') = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(\text{attack}|T) = 0.15 \)
4. \( P(\text{attack}|T') = 0.85 \)
5. \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
6. \( P(W|T') = 0.20 \)

We want to compute \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T') \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.5) + (0.20 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.5)}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.80 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's identification is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
