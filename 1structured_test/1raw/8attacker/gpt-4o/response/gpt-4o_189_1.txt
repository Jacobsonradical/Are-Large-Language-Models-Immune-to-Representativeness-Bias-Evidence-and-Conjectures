To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the variables for clarity:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this as:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
