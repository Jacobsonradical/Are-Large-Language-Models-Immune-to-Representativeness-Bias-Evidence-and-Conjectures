To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the prior probabilities of height distribution among attackers, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
1. P(W|H) = 0.80 (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such)
2. P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
3. P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
4. P(\neg H) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H|W) \):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
