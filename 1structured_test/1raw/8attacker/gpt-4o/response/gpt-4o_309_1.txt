To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the given conditions, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the structured approach:

1. **Define Events and Probabilities:**
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   
   We are given the following information:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

2. **Accuracy of the Witness:**
   - \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker indeed is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W|T') = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is, in fact, shorter than 185 cm).

3. **Calculate the Total Probability of the Witness's Identification:**
   - \( P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|T')P(T') \)
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
     \]
     \[
     P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):**
   - \( P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} \)
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
     \]
     \[
     P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
     \]
     \[
     P(T|W) \approx 0.414
     \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
