To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
1. \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(W | A^c) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | W) \):
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is approximately 0.41.
