To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a tall attacker)
   - \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (The witness mistakenly identifies a short attacker as tall)

3. **Calculate the overall probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (\( P(W) \)):**

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

4. **Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):**

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{{probability}}: 0.4138 \}
\]
