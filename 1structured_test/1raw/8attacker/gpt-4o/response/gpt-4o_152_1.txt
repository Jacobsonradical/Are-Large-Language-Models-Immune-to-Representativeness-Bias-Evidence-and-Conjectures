To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs given new evidence. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
5. \( P(E) \): The total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of such attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for attackers 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.20 \) (since the witness errs 20% of the time and might mistakenly identify shorter attackers as 185 cm or taller).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we first need to calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ 
P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) 
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 
P(E) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 
\]
\[ 
P(E) = 0.29 
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1|E) \):

\[ 
P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} 
\]

Substituting the values:

\[ 
P(H_1|E) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(H_1|E) \approx 0.414 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
