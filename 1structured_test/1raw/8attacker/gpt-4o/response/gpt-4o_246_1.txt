To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Here's the data outlined:
- Prior probability (\(P(T_{185})\)) that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or \(P(T_{185}) = 0.15\).
- Prior probability (\(P(T_{<185})\)) that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or \(P(T_{<185}) = 0.85\).
- The witness has a success rate of 80% in correctly identifying heights.

We define the following:
- \(P(W_{185} \mid T_{185})\): Probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- \(P(W_{185} \mid T_{<185})\): Probability the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20

We are looking for \(P(T_{185} \mid W_{185})\): The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T_{185} \mid W_{185}) = \frac{P(W_{185} \mid T_{185}) \cdot P(T_{185})}{P(W_{185})} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_{185}) = P(W_{185} \mid T_{185}) \cdot P(T_{185}) + P(W_{185} \mid T_{<185}) \cdot P(T_{<185}) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W_{185}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_{185}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(T_{185} \mid W_{185}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{185} \mid W_{185}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{185} \mid W_{185}) â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
