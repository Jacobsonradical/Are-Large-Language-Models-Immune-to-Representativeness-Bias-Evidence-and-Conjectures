To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is a step-by-step application of Bayes' theorem to solve the problem:

1. **Define Events**:
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size).
   - \( P(B) = 0.5 \) (complement of \( P(A) \)).
   - \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height when the person is 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(W | B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(A | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(B | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

3. **Calculate Prior Probabilities for the Attacker**:
   - Adjust the prior probabilities based on attack statistics:
     - Let \( P(\text{attacker} \& A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\text{attacker} \& B) = 0.85 \).
     - These reflect the conditional probabilities that the attacker's height is in a given range based on the history of attacks, rather than just the population.

4. **Calculate the Overall Probability of the Witness Identifying the Attacker as 185 cm or taller**:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A | \text{attacker}) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B | \text{attacker})
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

5. **Use Bayes' Theorem to Calculate \( P(A | W) \)**:
   \[
   P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A | \text{attacker})}{P(W)}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | W) \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is roughly 0.4138.
