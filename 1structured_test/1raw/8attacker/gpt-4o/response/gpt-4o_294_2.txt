To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W \mid H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information:
- 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 50% is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so \( P(\neg H \mid A) = 0.85 \) and \( P(H \mid A) = 0.15 \).
- The witness correctly identifies 80% of the time: \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(\neg W \mid \neg H) = 0.8 \).
- The witness makes errors 20% of the time: \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) and \( P(\neg W \mid H) = 0.2 \).

We need to find \( P(H \mid W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now calculate \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.8 \} \]
