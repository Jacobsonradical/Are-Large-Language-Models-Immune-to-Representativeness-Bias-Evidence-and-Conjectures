To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown of how we calculate it:

1. **Define Events**:
    - Let \( H \geq 185 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( H < 185 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
    - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
    - The probability that 185 cm or taller attackers are involved in attacks: \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \).
    - The probability that shorter attackers are involved in attacks: \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \).

3. **Conditional Probabilities**:
    - The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller: \( P(W | H \geq 185) = 0.80 \).
    - The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller: \( P(W | H < 185) = 0.20 \).

4. **Calculate the Posterior Probability** using Bayes' Theorem:
    \[
    P(H \geq 185 | W) = \frac{P(W | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W)}
    \]

    Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    \[
    P(W) = P(W | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W | H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185)
    \]
    \[
    P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
    \]

5. **Substitute back into Bayes' Theorem**:
    \[
    P(H \geq 185 | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41
    \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[
\{probability: 0.41\}
\]
