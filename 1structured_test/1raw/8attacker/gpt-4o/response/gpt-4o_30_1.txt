To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( A_1 \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

- \( P(A_1) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A_2) = 0.85 \): Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The witness's accuracy:

- \( P(W | A_1) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | A_2) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A_1 | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(A_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[ 
P(W) = P(W | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(W | A_2) \cdot P(A_2)
\]

Plug in the values:

\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) 
\]

\[ 
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A_1 | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[ 
P(A_1 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ 
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
