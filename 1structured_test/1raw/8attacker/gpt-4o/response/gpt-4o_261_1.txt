To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.
- \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being taller than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.5 \)
- Given the attacker is taller, the witness is correct 80% of the time: \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
- Given the attacker is shorter, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time: \( P(W|S) = 0.2 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Plug this back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.8 \} \]
