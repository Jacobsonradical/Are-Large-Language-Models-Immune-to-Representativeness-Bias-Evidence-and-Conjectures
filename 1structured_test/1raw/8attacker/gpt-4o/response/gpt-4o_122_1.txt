To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness.

Given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
