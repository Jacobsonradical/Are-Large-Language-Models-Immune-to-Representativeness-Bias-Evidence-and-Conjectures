To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the relevant information distilled:

1. **Prior probability for different attackers**:
   - P(Taller | Attack) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - P(Shorter | Attack) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood of the witness's accuracy**:
   - P(Witness says Taller | Taller) = 0.80 (80% correct if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
   - P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) = 0.20 (20% correct if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Need to find**: P(Taller | Witness says Taller)

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = \frac{P(Witness says Taller | Taller) \cdot P(Taller)}{P(Witness says Taller)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(Witness says Taller) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(Witness says Taller) = P(Witness says Taller | Taller) \cdot P(Taller) + P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) \cdot P(Shorter) \]

Substitute the known probabilities:

- \( P(Witness says Taller | Taller) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(Taller) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(Shorter) = 0.85 \)

\[ P(Witness says Taller) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(Witness says Taller) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(Witness says Taller) = 0.29 \]

Now, plug this back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(Taller | Witness says Taller) = \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
