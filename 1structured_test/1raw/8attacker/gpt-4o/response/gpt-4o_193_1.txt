To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Here are the components we need:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that a random person in the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(W \mid T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:

- From information "a", we know the population's prior probabilities:
  \[ P(T) = 0.5 \text{ (since the population is equally split)} \]
  \[ P(\neg T) = 0.5 \]

- From information "a", we have:
  \[ P(\text{attack} \mid T) = 0.15 \]
  \[ P(\text{attack} \mid \neg T) = 0.85 \]

- Given the witness's accuracy from information "b":
  \[ P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \]
  \[ P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \]

To find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T)P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T)P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.5) + (0.20 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.5}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.80 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
