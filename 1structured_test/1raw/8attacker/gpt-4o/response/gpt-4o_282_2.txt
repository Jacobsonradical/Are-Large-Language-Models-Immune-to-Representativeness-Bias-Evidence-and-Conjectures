Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since half the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W \mid A) = 0.8 \) (the probability the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W \mid \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in \( P(A \mid W \text{ and attacker}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W \text{ and attacker}) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid \text{attacker})}{P(W \mid \text{attacker})} \]

First, let's determine \( P(W \mid \text{attacker}) \):
\[ P(W \mid \text{attacker}) = P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid \text{attacker}) + P(W \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A \mid \text{attacker}) \]
\[ = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(A \mid W \text{ and attacker}) \):
\[ P(A \mid W \text{ and attacker}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
