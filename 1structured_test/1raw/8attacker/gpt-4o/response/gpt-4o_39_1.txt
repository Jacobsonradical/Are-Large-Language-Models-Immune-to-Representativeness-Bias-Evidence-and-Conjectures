To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) : The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) : The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

First, let's list the known probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is equal)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \) (complement of \( P(A) \))
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall person)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Then, calculate \( P(A | W) \):
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]

So, the estimated probability is:
\{probability: 0.8\}
