To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem.

We define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E \mid H_1) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(E \mid H_2) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
