To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is equally split).
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.
- \( P(E | H_1) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as such = 0.8.
- \( P(E | H_2) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.

We also know:
- \( P(H_2 | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) 
- \( P(H_1 | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \)

Now we can use the information to find:
- \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given both hypotheses.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).
