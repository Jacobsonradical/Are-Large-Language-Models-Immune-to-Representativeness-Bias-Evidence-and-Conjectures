To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller \( P(A) = 0.15 \).
- The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm \( P(B) = 0.85 \).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given the person is indeed 185 cm or taller \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given the person is shorter than 185 cm \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \).

We seek to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
