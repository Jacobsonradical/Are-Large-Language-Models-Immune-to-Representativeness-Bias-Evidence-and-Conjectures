We can solve this using Bayes' Theorem, which will allow us to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the available information.

Let's denote:
- \(H\) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \(L\) as the event "attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \(W\) as the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

From the information provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(L) = 0.85\) (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W|H) = 0.80\) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W|L) = 0.20\) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We are interested in \(P(H|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} 
\]

where \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|L) \cdot P(L)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

Calculating \(P(W)\):

\[ 
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substitute \(P(W)\) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} 
\]

\[ 
P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 
\]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Therefore the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
