To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

### Given Information:
- Prior probabilities:
  \( P(Tall) \) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly split into equal halves)
  \( P(Short) \) = 0.5 

- Conditional probabilities:
  \( P(Attacker|Short) \) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
  \( P(Attacker|Tall) \) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

- Witness accuracy:
  \( P(WitnessCorrect|Tall) \) = 0.8
  \( P(WitnessWrong|Tall) \) = 0.2
  \( P(WitnessCorrect|Short) \) = 0.8
  \( P(WitnessWrong|Short) \) = 0.2

### To find:
The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Tall|Witness) = \frac{P(Witness|Tall) \times P(Tall)}{P(Witness)} \]

#### Step-by-Step Calculations:

1. **Calculate the likelihoods \( P(Witness|Tall) \) and \( P(Witness|Short) \):**
   - If the attacker is tall, the witness correctly identifies them as tall 80% of the time, so:
     \( P(Witness|Tall) = 0.8 \)
   - If the attacker is short, the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall 20% of the time, so:
     \( P(Witness|Short) = 0.2 \)

2. **Calculate the total probability \( P(Witness) \):**
   \[ P(Witness) = P(Witness|Tall) \times P(Tall) + P(Witness|Short) \times P(Short) \]
   \[ P(Witness) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(Witness) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[ P(Tall|Witness) = \frac{P(Witness|Tall) \times P(Tall)}{P(Witness)} \]
   \[ P(Tall|Witness) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(Tall|Witness) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(Tall|Witness) \approx 0.414 \]

### Conclusion:
Based on the Bayes' theorem calculation, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
