To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identified an attacker who is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|T') = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identified an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T') \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.4138 \} \]
