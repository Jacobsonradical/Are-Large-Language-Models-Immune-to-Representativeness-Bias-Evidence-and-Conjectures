To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Here are the important pieces of information we have:

1. The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness: \( P(H \mid W) \).
2. The probability that a witness correctly identifies a person's height: 80%.
3. The probability that the witness makes an identification error: 20%.
4. The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 85%.
5. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller: 15%.

To find \( P(H \mid W) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where,
- \( P(H \mid W) \) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability the witness identifies anyone as being 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where,
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) \) is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.20.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

So let's calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: \approx 0.414 \} \]
