To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

- The probability of being 185 cm or taller (prior for \( A \)): \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
- The probability of being shorter than 185 cm (prior for \( B \)): \( P(B) = 0.5 \).
- The probability that a person shorter than 185 cm will be identified as being 185 cm or taller (false positive rate): \( P(W|B) = 0.2 \).
- The probability that a person 185 cm or taller will be correctly identified by the witness (true positive rate): \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \).

Bayes' theorem states that:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|B)P(B)
\]

Now let's plug in the numbers:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.8}
\]
