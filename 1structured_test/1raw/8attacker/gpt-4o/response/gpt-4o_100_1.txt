We can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem, which is useful in updating the probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

We start with the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We also need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{(0.8) \cdot (0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is \( \{ probability: 0.8 \} \).
