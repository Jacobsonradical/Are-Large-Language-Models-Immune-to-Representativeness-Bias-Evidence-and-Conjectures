To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conditions, we can apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps in updating the probability of a hypothesis, based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.50 \) (The general population probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.50 \)
- \( P(\text{attacker} | \neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{attacker} | T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) P(T) + P(W | \neg T) P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.50) + (0.20 \times 0.50) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.50)}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.80 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.80 \} \]

So, the final answer is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.80 \} \]
