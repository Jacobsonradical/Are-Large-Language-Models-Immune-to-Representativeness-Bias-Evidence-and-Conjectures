To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H_1|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H_1) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified an attacker of height 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (derived from the population statistics of such attackers).
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(E) \), we can use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H_2) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
- \( P(H_2) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (derived from the population statistics).

Now, plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
