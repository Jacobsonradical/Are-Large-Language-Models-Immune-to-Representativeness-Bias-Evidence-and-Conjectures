To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We know:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
