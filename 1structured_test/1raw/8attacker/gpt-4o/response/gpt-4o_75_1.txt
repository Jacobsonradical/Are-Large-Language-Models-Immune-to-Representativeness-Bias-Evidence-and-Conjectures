To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- Prior probabilities: \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \).
- Likelihoods: \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \) and \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \).

We aim to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Calculating \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
