To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly split equally)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifying tall people)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifying short people)
- \( P(\text{attacker} | T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{attacker} | \neg T) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) P(T) + P(W | \neg T) P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is \( 0.8 \).

Therefore, the output format is:
{probability: 0.8}
