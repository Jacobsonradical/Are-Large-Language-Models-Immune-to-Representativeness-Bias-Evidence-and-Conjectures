To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the prior probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|T') = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate \( P(W) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
