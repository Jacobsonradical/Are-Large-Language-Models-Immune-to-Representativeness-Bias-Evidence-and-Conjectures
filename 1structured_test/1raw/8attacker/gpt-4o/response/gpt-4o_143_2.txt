To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the described conditions, we should use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We'll start by defining the relevant probabilities:

- \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T') \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T') \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|T') = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is roughly 0.414.
