To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size for both height groups).
2. \( P(\text{attacker is under 185 cm} | E) = 0.85 \) and \( P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller} | E) = 0.15 \) (percentages of attackers based on height).
3. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
   - \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \}
\]
