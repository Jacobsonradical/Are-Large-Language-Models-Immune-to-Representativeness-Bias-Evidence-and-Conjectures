To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B | A) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is evenly split between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Using the law of total probability, we have:
\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.8 \]

So, we have:

\[ {probability: 0.8} \]
