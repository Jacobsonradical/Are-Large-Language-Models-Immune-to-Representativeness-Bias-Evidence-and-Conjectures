To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Here’s the given information in a structured form:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness says the attacker is tall (>= 185 cm) given the attacker is tall)
- \( P(W|F) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness says the attacker is tall (>= 185 cm) given the attacker is not tall (< 185 cm))

From the general population:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (Probability that the attacker is tall (>= 185 cm))
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (Probability that the attacker is not tall (< 185 cm))

We need to find \( P(T|W) \): the probability that the attacker is tall given that the witness identified the attacker as tall.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \) (the probability the witness says the attacker is tall). According to the Law of Total Probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|F) \cdot P(F)
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:
{
  probability: 0.4138
}
