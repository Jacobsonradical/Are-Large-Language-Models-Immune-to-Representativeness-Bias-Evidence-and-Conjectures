To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll use the following steps:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. Compute the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

3. Compute the conditional probabilities:
   - \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

4. Compute the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(B) \)

5. Apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability:
   - \( P(A|B) \)

Given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies these heights 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies these heights 20% of the time)

Total probability \( P(B) \) is computed as:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
