To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- The probabilities of being under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller in the general population are equal (50% each).
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The witness correctly identifies height with 80% accuracy and makes errors 20% of the time.

We define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We seek \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (80% correct identification)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (20% error when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

First, we calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
