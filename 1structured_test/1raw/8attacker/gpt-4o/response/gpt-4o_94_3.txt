To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Base rates (priors):**
   - \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
   - \( P(T') = 0.5 \)

3. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
   - \( P(W \mid T') = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

4. **Using Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid T') \cdot P(T')
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]

6. **Calculate posterior probability:**
   \[
   P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Here's the final answer in the specified format:

{probability: 0.8}
