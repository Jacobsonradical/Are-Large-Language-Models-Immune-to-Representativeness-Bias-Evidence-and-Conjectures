To solve the problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to update the probability distribution based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(W \mid H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time).

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
