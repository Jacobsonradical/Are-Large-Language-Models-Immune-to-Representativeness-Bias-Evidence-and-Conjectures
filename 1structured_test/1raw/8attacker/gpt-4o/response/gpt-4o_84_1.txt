To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is taller than 185 cm.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being taller than 185 cm.

Given:
\- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
\- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

The probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is \( \geq 185 \) cm, denoted by \( P(W|T) \), is 0.80. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person who is \( <185 \) cm as \( \geq 185 \) cm, denoted by \( P(W|\neg T) \), is 0.20.
   
Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
