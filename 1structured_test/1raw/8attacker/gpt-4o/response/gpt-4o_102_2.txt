To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:
- The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\(P(\text{Height} < 185)\)) and 185 cm or taller (\(P(\text{Height} \ge 185)\)) is both 0.5.
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, hence \(P(\text{Attacker} | \text{Height} < 185)\) = 0.85 and \(P(\text{Attacker} | \text{Height} \ge 185)\) = 0.15.
- The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller (\(P(\text{Identified as tall} | \text{Height} \ge 185)\)) is 0.8, and incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (\(P(\text{Identified as tall} | \text{Height} < 185)\)) is 0.2.

We are to find \(P(\text{Height} \ge 185 | \text{Identified as tall})\).

From Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \ge 185 | \text{Identified as tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as tall} | \text{Height} \ge 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} \ge 185)}{P(\text{Identified as tall})} \]

First, we calculate \(P(\text{Identified as tall})\):

\[ P(\text{Identified as tall}) = P(\text{Identified as tall} | \text{Height} \ge 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} \ge 185) + P(\text{Identified as tall} | \text{Height} < 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} < 185) \]

\[ P(\text{Identified as tall}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as tall}) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as tall}) = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{Height} \ge 185 | \text{Identified as tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(\text{Height} \ge 185 | \text{Identified as tall}) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
