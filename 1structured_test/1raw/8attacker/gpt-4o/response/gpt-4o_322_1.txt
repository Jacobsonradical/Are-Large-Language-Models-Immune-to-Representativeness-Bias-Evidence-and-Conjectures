To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayesian inference, which involves updating our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in height)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W \mid A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter attackers as tall 20% of the time)

We are looking for \( P(A \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, can be calculated as:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A \mid W) \):
\[ P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Hence, the answer is:
\{probability: 0.8\}
