To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \(T\) = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(NT\) = Event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm).
- \(W\) = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(T) = 0.5\)
- \(P(NT) = 0.5\)
- \(P(W|T) = 0.8\)
- \(P(W|NT) = 0.2\)
- \(P(T|a) = 0.15\)
- \(P(NT|a) = 0.85\)

First, we need to convert the percentage to conditional probabilities:
- \(P(a|T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(a|NT) = 0.85\)

We want to find:
\[ P(T|W) \]

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \(P(W)\):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|NT)P(NT) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can compute \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 * 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
