To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is a mathematical formula used to determine conditional probability. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \geq 185 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T < 185 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding \( P(T \geq 185 \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such.

We need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(T \geq 185) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(T < 185) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W \mid T \geq 185) \): The likelihood that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W \mid T < 185) \): The likelihood that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter.

From the given information:

- \( P(T \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T < 185) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W \mid T \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W \mid T < 185) = 0.20 \)

Let's apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(W \mid T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
