To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the provided information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally split between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (population of people shorter than 185 cm).

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore:
\[ \{ probability: 0.8 \} \]
