To answer the question, let's use Bayes' theorem. Here's the needed information rearranged into more useful forms:

- P(Witness identifies attacker as ≥ 185 cm | Attacker is ≥ 185 cm) = 0.80
- P(Witness identifies attacker as ≥ 185 cm | Attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.20
- P(Attacker is ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
- P(Attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.85

We need to calculate P(Attacker is ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies attacker as ≥ 185 cm). Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is ≥ 185 cm.
- B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as ≥ 185 cm.

First, we need to find P(B), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as ≥ 185 cm:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 
P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \\
     = 0.12 + 0.17 \\
     = 0.29 
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\
          = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \\
          = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \\
          \approx 0.4138 
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately {probability: 0.41}.
