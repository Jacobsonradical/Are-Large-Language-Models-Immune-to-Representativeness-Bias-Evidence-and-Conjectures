To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W \): The witness did not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Based on the problem, we have the following information:

- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (The probability that any randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, since the population is split equally.)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (The probability that any randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a taller attacker.)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as taller.)

First, we need to find the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
