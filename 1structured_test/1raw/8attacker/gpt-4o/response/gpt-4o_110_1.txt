To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \) : Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) : Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) : Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

First, we know:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size).
- \( P(S) = 0.5 \).
  
From the problem statement:
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | S) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

Let's apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):
\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | S) \cdot P(S)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{probability: 0.8\}
\]
