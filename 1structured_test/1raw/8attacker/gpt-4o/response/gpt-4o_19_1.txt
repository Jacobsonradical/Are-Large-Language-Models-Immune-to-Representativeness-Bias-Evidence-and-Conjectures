To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define our terms:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \): The probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \): The total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Firstly, we need to compute \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W) \):

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:
