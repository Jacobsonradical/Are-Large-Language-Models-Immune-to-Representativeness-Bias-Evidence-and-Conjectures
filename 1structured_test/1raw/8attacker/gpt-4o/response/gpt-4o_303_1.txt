To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

1. The probability that the witness correctly identifies the height of the attacker when they are 185 cm or taller is \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \).

2. The probability that the witness makes an error and identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is \( P(W | L) = 0.20 \).

3. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

4. The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is \( P(L) = 0.85 \).

We want to find \( P(H | W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

The total probability \( P(W) \) can be found by considering both scenarios (attacker 185 cm or taller and attacker shorter than 185 cm):

\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | L) \cdot P(L) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the estimate is: 

{probability: 0.4138}
