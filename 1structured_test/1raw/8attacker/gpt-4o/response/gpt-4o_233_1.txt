To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can employ Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given data, we break down the information as follows:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (prior probability that a person from the general population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.5 \) (prior probability that a person from the general population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T|A) = 0.15 \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller among the attackers)
- \( P(S|A) = 0.85 \) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm among the attackers)

We need to find \( P(T|W,A) \). Using Bayes' Theorem in the context of attack probabilities and witness identification, we have:
\[ P(T|W,A) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T|A)}{P(W|T) \cdot P(T|A) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S|A)} \]

Plugging in the given probabilities:
\[ P(T|W,A) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(T|W,A) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(T|W,A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W,A) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
