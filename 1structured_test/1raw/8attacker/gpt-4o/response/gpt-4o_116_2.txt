To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the other information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the relevant events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[ P(H_1 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's find the components on the right-hand side of the equation.

1. **Prior probabilities:**

   Since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller,

   - \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)

2. **Probability of the witness identifying the height correctly or incorrectly:**

   Given the witness's accuracy:
   
   - \( P(W \mid H_1) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(W \mid H_2) = 0.2 \) (since if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness makes an error 20% of the time)

3. **Total probability \( P(W) \):**

   Using the law of total probability:

   \[ P(W) = P(W \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 \mid W) \):

\[ P(H_1 \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
