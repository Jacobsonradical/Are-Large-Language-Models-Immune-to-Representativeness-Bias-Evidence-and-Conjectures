To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

First, we define the following:

- \(T\): the event that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.
- \(N\): the event that the attacker is not taller than 185 cm.
- \(W\): the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed taller than 185 cm.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(N) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|N) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Now, we calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|N) \cdot P(N) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
