To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's break down the components:

1. **\( P(T) \) and \( P(T') \)**: These are the prior probabilities:
    - \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population split is roughly equal).
    - \( P(T') = 0.5 \).

2. **\( P(W|T) \)**: The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:
    - Given the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, this is \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \).

3. **\( P(W|T') \)**: The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:
    - Given the witness errs 20% of the time, this is \( P(W|T') = 0.2 \).

4. **\( P(W) \)**: The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
    - This can be computed using the law of total probability:
    \[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T') \]
    \[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
    \[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
