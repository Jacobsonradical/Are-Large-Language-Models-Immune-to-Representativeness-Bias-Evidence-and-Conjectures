To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

1. **Calculate \( P(T) \) and \( P(\lnot T) \):**
    - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(\lnot T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Calculate \( P(W | T) \) and \( P(W | \lnot T) \):**
    - \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a tall attacker 80% of the time)
    - \( P(W | \lnot T) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall 20% of the time)

3. **Calculate the overall probability \( P(W) \):**

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \lnot T) \cdot P(\lnot T) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
