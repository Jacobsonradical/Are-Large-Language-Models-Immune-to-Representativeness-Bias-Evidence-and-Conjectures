First, let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Now, we need the individual components:
- \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \)

Now, let's calculate \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Then, using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T | W) \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
