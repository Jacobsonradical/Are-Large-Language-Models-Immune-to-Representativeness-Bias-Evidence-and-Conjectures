To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is ideal for updating probabilities given new evidence. We'll denote the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(A) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.5.
- P(B) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5.
- P(W|A) = Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- P(W|B) = Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.2.
- P(A|W) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them so.

We can find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|B)P(B) \]

Substituting the provided values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|W) \):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Substituting the values we have:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
