We can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the known probabilities.

Let's define the events:

- \( T \geq 185 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T < 185 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find:
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) \]

From the information given:

1. The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(T \geq 185) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \).
2. The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(T < 185) = 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.425 \).

The witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W \mid T \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W \mid T < 185) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(W \mid T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.075) + (0.20 \cdot 0.425) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.06 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.145 \]

Now calculate \( P(T \geq 185 \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.075}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) = \frac{0.06}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
