To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B|A)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (\(P(B|A) = 0.8\)).
- The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (\(P(B|A') = 0.2\)).
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
  Therefore, \(P(A) = 0.15\) and \(P(A') = 0.85\).

We need to calculate \(P(B)\):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we calculate \(P(A|B)\):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
