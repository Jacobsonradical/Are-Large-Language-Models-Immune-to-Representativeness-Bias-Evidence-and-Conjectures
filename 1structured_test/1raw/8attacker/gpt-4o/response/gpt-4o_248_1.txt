To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which enables us to update the probability of a hypothesis (the attacker is taller than 185 cm) based on new evidence (the witness's identification). Here is the step-by-step calculation:

1. Define the events:
   - \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(T'\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \(W\): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \(P(T) = 0.5\): Overall probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(P(T') = 0.5\): Overall probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \(P(W|T) = 0.8\): Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(P(W|T') = 0.2\): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.
   - \(P(A|T) = 0.15\): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given an attack occurred.
   - \(P(A|T') = 0.85\): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given an attack occurred.

3. Calculate the prior probability of the events \(T_A\) (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and \(T'_A\) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
   - \(P(T_A) = P(A|T)P(T) = 0.15 \times 0.5 = 0.075\)
   - \(P(T'_A) = P(A|T')P(T') = 0.85 \times 0.5 = 0.425\)

4. Update these probabilities using the witness's information:
   - Using Bayesâ€™ Theorem, calculate the posterior probability \(P(T|W)\):
     \[
     P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)}
     \]
   - First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \) (the total probability of \(W\) occurring):
     \[
     P(W) = P(W|T)P(T_A) + P(W|T')P(T'_A) = 0.8 \times 0.075 + 0.2 \times 0.425 = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145
     \]

5. Final calculation for \( P(T|W) \):
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T_A)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.075}{0.145} = \frac{0.06}{0.145} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is roughly \(0.4138\).
