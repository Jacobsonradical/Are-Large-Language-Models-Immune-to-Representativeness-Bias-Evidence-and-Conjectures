To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to estimate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, let's calculate each component:
1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker correctly as being 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, whether correctly or incorrectly.

From the information given:
- The population is split equally, so \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, meaning that \( P(\text{not } A) = 0.85 \) and \( P(A) = 0.15 \).

The witness's identification accuracy:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B|\text{not } A) = 0.2 \)

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\text{not } A)P(\text{not } A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
