To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can employ Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability (the probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller).

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller).

We also need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
where \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \).

Thus:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
