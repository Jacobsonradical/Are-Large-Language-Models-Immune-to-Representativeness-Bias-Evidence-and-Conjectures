To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller.

Plugging in the values from the information given:

1. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.
2. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(B|A') \): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 20% or 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases).
4. \( P(A') \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.

Next, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
