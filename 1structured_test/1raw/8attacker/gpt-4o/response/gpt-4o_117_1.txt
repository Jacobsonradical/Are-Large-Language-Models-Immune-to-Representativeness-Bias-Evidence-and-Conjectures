To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(T) \)) is 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(\neg T) \)) is 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Given the witness's reliability:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller (\( P(W|T) \)) is 0.80.
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter (\( P(W|\neg T) \)) is 0.20.

We want to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such (\( P(T|W) \)).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
