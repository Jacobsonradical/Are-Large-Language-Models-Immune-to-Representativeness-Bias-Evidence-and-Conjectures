We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the provided statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( P(W|H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W|\neg H) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( P(\neg W|H) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- \( P(\neg W|\neg H) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\neg W|H) = 1 - P(W|H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\neg W|\neg H) = 1 - P(W|\neg H) = 0.80 \)

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. 

By Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

where:
\[
P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Let's substitute:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(H|W) \):
\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer:
\[
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
