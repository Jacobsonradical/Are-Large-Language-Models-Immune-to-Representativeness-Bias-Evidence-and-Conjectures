To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W \): The witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given information:
1. \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal).
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \).
3. \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy of the witness for those 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate for those shorter than 185 cm).
5. \( P(W) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's compute \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|\neg T)P(\neg T) 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 
\]
\[ 
P(W) = 0.5 
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ 
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} 
\]
\[ 
P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} 
\]
\[ 
P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} 
\]
\[ 
P(T|W) = 0.8 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
