To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, let's apply Bayes' theorem. Given the information provided, we need to weigh the prior probabilities (based on general population and attackers) and the likelihood of witness accuracy.

Let's define:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( \neg T \) as the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W) \) as the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
- Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm, \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
