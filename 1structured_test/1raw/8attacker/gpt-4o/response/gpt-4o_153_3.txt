To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the relevant information we have:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    - 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
    - 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

2. **Likelihood of Witness Identification:**
    - If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify them as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (and correctly identify them as shorter 80% of the time).
    - If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time (and incorrectly identify them as shorter 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using the provided information:

\[ P(T) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(W | T) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(W | S) = 0.20 \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
