To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of a hypothesis given some evidence to the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \): The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \): The witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter in 20% of cases.
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% of attackers are shorter).

Using the law of total probability to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
