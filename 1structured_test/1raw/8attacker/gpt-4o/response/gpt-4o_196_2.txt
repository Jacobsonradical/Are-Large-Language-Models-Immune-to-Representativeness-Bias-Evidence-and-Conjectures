To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates based on new evidence. 

Let's define:

- \( T \) = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) = The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

1. \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are)
2. \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are not)
3. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
