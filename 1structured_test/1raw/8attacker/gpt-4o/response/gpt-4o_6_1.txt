To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem is represented as follows:

\[ 
P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} 
\]

where:
- \(H_1\): attacker 185 cm or taller
- \(W\): witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller
- \(P(H_1|W)\): probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification
- \(P(W|H_1)\): probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8
- \(P(H_1)\): overall probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15
- \(P(W)\): total probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller

First, let's calculate \(P(W)\) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

where:
- \(H_2\): attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \(P(W|H_2)\): probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2
- \(P(H_2)\): overall probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85

Now substituting in these values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now we can substitute \(P(W)\) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1|W) \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
