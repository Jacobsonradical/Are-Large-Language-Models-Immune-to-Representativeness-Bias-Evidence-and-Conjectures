To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H \): the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): the event that the attacker is less than 185 cm.
- \( E \): the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H \mid E) \): the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- The population is split evenly between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller:
  \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
  \[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time:
  \[ P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \]
  \[ P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \]

Using these values, we need to calculate \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H \mid E) \):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
