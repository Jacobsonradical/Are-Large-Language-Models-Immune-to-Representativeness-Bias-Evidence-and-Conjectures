To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probability \( P(A|W) \), where the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|W) \):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
