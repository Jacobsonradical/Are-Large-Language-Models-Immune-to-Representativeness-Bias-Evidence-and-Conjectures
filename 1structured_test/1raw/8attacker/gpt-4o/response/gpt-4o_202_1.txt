To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. 

Given information:

- Probability of being an attacker if shorter than 185 cm, \( P(A|\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- Probability of being an attacker if 185 cm or taller, \( P(A|H) = 0.15 \)
- The population is equally divided by height, so \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- Witness's accuracy in identifying height:
  - Correct identification: 80%
  - Incorrect identification: 20%

We denote:
- \( H \) = being 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \) = being shorter than 185 cm
- \( E \) = witness identifying as 185 cm or taller

We seek \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

We need to compute \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Here's what we know:
- \( P(E|H) \) = probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.2
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \)

Substituting these values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
