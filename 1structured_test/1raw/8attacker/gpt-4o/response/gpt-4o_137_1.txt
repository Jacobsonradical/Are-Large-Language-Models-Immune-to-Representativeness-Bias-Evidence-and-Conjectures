To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is used to update the probability estimate for an event based on new information. Here, we have:

- \( P(A|B) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification.
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:

1. \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (80% correct identification rate for 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (20% incorrect identification rate for shorter than 185 cm).

We use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes’ Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
