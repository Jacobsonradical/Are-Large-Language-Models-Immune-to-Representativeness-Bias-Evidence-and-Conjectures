To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as taller (185 cm or taller).

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population taller and shorter than 185 cm are roughly equal)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a taller person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller 20% of the time)
  
We are asked to compute \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
