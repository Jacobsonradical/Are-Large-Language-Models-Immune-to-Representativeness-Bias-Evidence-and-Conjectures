To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We're looking for \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)} \]

From the information provided:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Let's substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculating the numerator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
