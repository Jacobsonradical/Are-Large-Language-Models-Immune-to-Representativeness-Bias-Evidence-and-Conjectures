To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We will calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Let's denote:

- \( T \) for the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) for the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) for the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. This can be calculated using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \)

From the population data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

Now we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \] 

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \] 
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
