To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time).
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Next, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both scenarios where the attacker is taller or shorter:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
