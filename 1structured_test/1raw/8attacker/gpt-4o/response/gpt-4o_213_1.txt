To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the given information rephrased for better comprehension:

- A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- Given equal proportions of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time.
- Roughly 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We aim to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to determine the components:
1. \( P(T) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(W | T) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(W) \): Total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as tall 20% of the time).

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.41\}
