To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Denote:

- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) \): The likelihood that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|S) \): The likelihood that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identified height)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (the witness erred)

We need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H)P(H) + P(W|S)P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
