To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Firstly, let's define some terms:

- \( P(H) \) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
- \( P(\neg H) \) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) \) = probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H|W) \) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using the information provided:

- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Population distribution implies equal probability)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time)

We need to calculate \( P(H|W) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]

\[ P(H|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
