To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\neg T) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

   According to the information provided, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, but 85% of the attackers are under 185 cm.

   Thus:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

3. **Likelihoods (based on witness accuracy):**
   - \( P(W|T) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W|\neg T) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

   According to the witness reliability:
   - \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

4. **Calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W) \) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
   \]

   First, calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

   Now, calculate \( P(T|W) \):
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W) \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
