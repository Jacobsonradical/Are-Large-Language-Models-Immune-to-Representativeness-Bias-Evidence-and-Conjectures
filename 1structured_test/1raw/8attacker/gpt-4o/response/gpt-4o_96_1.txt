We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let:
- \(A\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \(P(A|B)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given:
- \(P(A) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075\) (the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, considering both population and attack statistics).
- \(P(A^c) = 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.425\) (the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(B|A) = 0.80\) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B|A^c) = 0.20\) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]

First, we calculate \(P(B)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c)\]
\[P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.075) + (0.20 \times 0.425)\]
\[P(B) = 0.06 + 0.085\]
\[P(B) = 0.145\]

Now we can find \(P(A|B)\):
\[P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.075)}{0.145}\]
\[P(A|B) = \frac{0.06}{0.145}\]
\[P(A|B) = \frac{60}{145}\]
\[P(A|B) \approx 0.4138\]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
