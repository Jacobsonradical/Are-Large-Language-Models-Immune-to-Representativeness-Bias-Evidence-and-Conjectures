To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

Given data:

- The prior probability \( P(T) \) is 0.5 (because the population divides equally into those shorter and taller than 185 cm).
- The probability that the attacker is under 185 cm given that an attacker is thought to be under 185 cm is 0.85. 
- The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that an attacker is thought to be 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- The witness's accuracy in identifying someone 185 cm or taller is 80%, and the error rate is 20%. 

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification (\(W\)).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.50 + 0.20 \cdot 0.50 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, plug the values into Bayes' Theorem formula:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.50}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.80 \]

Given the witness's information and the prior statistics, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.

Hence, the final estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
