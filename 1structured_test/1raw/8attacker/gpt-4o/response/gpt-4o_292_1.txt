To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. We denote the following events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The given information can be broken down into the following probabilities:

- Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(A') = 0.5 \)
- Probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller if actually 185 cm or taller, \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
- Probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller if shorter than 185 cm, \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \), i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
