To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (80% correct identification)
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% error in identification)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to find \( P(W) \), which can be computed using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
