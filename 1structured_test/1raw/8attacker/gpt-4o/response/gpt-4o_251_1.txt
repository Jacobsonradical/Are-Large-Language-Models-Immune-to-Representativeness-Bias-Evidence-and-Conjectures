To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness' identification.

We have the following probabilities:
1. The prior probabilities (before considering the witness identification):
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equally divided).
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \).

2. The likelihood of the witness identification given the true height:
   - \( P(E \mid H_1) = 0.8 \) (the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(E \mid H_2) = 0.2 \) (the witness is wrong 20% of the time and identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

3. The base rates of the attacker heights:
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

First, we compute the overall (unconditioned) probability of the evidence \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to get \( P(H_1 \mid E) \):
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
