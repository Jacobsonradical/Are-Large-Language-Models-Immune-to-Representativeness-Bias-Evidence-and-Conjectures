To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

- P(W | A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(W | B) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
