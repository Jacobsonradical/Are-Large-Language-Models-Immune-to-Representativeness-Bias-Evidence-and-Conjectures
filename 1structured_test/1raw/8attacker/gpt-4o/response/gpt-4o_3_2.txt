To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following terms:

- \( P(H) \) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\lnot H) \) = probability that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) \) = probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\lnot H) \) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is under 185 cm.

From the given information:

- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\lnot H) = 0.5 \) since the population distribution is equal.
- \( P(H|A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\lnot H|A) = 0.85 \) where \( A \) indicates an attacker. This translates to \( P(A|H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A|\lnot H) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W|\lnot H) = 0.20 \).

We need to find the revised probability \( P(H|W) \), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\lnot H) \cdot P(\lnot H)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.5)}{(0.80) \cdot (0.5) + (0.20) \cdot (0.5)}
\]

\[
P(H|W) = \frac{0.40}{0.40 + 0.10} = \frac{0.40}{0.50} = 0.80
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.80\}
