To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H|W) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Putting it all together:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
