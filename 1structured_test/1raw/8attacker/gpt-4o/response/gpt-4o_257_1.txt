To determine the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information, we'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) = the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) = the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) = the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Step 1: Compute the prior probabilities.**

From information "a":
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is roughly equal).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (same reasoning as above).

**Step 2: Compute the likelihoods.**

From information "b":
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time).

**Step 3: Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T|W) \).**

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness saying the attacker was tall) is given by:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we can find \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.8 \} \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.8 \} \]
