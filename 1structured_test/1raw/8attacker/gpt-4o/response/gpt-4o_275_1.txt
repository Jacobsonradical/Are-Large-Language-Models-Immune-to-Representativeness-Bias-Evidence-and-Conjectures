To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_T \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_N \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We need to determine \( P(T | W_T) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Given data:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W_T | T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_T | N) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(N | \text{attack}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(T | \text{attack}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{P(W_T | T) P(T)}{P(W_T)} \]

Where \( P(W_T) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is given by:
\[ P(W_T) = P(W_T | T) P(T) + P(W_T | N) P(N) \]

Calculate \( P(W_T) \):
\[ P(W_T) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(W_T) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W_T) = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W_T) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.8}
