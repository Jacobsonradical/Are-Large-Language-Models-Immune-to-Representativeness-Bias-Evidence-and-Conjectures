To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
- Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \).

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

So:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
