Let's use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. To do so, we need to define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

1. \( P(A) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size).
2. \( P(B) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5.
3. \( P(\text{attack under 185 cm} | \text{attacker}) \) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
4. \( P(\text{attack 185 cm or taller} | \text{attacker}) \) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
5. \( P(W | A) \) (likelihood that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
6. \( P(W | B) \) (likelihood that the witness identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.

We want to find \( P(A | W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. 

Bayes' theorem gives us:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A)P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Let's find \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | A)P(A) + P(W | B)P(B) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.8}
