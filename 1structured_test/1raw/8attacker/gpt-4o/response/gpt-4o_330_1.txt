To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \(\Pr(W \mid T) = 0.8\): The probability witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(\Pr(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2\): The probability witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.
- \(\Pr(T) = 0.15\): The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\Pr(\neg T) = 0.85\): The prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \(\Pr(T \mid W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
\Pr(T \mid W) = \frac{\Pr(W \mid T) \Pr(T)}{\Pr(W \mid T) \Pr(T) + \Pr(W \mid \neg T) \Pr(\neg T)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\Pr(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85}
\]

\[
\Pr(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
\]

\[
\Pr(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
\Pr(T \mid W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
