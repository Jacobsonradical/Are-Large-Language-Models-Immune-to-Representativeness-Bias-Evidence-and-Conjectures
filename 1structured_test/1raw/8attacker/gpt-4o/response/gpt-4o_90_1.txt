To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for tall attackers)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter attackers as tall in 20% of cases)

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
