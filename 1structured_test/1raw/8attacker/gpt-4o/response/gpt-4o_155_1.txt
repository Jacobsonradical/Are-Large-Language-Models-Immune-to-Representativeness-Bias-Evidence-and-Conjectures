To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

- Prior probability \( P(T) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) based on the population split.
- Conditional probability \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- Conditional probability \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies height if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- Conditional probability \( P(T \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- Conditional probability \( P(\neg T \mid \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

To compute the \(\ P(T \mid W) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}.
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, compute \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:

\[
\{ \text{probability:} \ 0.8 \}
\]
