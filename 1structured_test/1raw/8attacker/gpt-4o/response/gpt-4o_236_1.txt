To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substitute the given probabilities:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|W) \approx 0.41
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \}
\]
