To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. We are given the following:

- The prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller:
  - \( P(H_{\geq 185}) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(H_{< 185}) = 0.85 \)

- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person’s height given they are 185 cm or taller:
  - \( P(W_{\geq 185} | H_{\geq 185}) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_{< 185} | H_{\geq 185}) = 0.20 \)

- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person’s height given they are shorter than 185 cm:
  - \( P(W_{\geq 185} | H_{< 185}) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(W_{< 185} | H_{< 185}) = 0.80 \)

We want to find \( P(H_{\geq 185} | W_{\geq 185}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the person as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | W_{\geq 185}) = \frac{P(W_{\geq 185} | H_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(H_{\geq 185})}{P(W_{\geq 185})} \]

First, we compute \( P(W_{\geq 185}) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_{\geq 185}) = P(W_{\geq 185} | H_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(H_{\geq 185}) + P(W_{\geq 185} | H_{< 185}) \cdot P(H_{< 185}) \]
\[ P(W_{\geq 185}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_{\geq 185}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_{\geq 185}) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | W_{\geq 185}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | W_{\geq 185}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | W_{\geq 185}) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
