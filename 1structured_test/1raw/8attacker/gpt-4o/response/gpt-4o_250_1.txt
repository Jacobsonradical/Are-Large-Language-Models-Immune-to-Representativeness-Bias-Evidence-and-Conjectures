To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and other provided information, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (witness identification).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (witness identifies correctly when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (witness misidentifies when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
