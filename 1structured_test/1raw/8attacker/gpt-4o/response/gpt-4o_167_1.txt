To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness's identification).

Let's denote:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
1. The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based on general statistics: \( P(H) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \).
2. The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based on attacks: \( P(H|A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H|A) = 0.85 \).

Considering the witness's identification:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller is 80%: \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller is the complement: \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \).

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) P(H) + P(W|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

So:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.8 \} \]
