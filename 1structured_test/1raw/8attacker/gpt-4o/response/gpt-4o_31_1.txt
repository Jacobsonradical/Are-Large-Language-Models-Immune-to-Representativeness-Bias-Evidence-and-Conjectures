To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events. 

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) as the evidence provided by the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

We know:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be computed as:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Now, inserting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is about 0.414.
