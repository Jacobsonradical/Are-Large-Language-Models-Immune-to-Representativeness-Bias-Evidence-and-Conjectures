To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We want to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the evidence \( E \) (the witness's identification).

Given:
- Prior probabilities (\( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \)):
  - \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally split)
  - \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)
- Conditional probabilities (\( P(E \mid H_1) \) and \( P(E \mid H_2) \)):
  - The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller: \( P(E \mid H_1) = 0.8 \)
  - The witness errs 20% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, incorrectly identifying them as shorter: \( P(\neg E \mid H_1) = 0.2 \)
  - The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm (thus they would not identify them as taller): \( P(\neg E \mid H_2) = 0.8 \)
  - The witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, identifying them as taller: \( P(E \mid H_2) = 0.2 \)

We are interested in \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \):
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
