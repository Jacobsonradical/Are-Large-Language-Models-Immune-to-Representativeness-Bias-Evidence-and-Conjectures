To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which in this context can be formulated as:

\[ P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) = \frac{P(\text{witness identified tall} | \text{tall}) \cdot P(\text{tall})}{P(\text{witness identified tall})} \]

where:
- \( P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) \) is the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness identified the attacker as tall.
- \( P(\text{witness identified tall} | \text{tall}) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall, which is 0.80.
- \( P(\text{tall}) \) is the prior probability that a random person from the population of attackers is tall, which is 0.15.
- \( P(\text{witness identified tall}) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall.

To calculate \( P(\text{witness identified tall}) \), we need to consider both cases when the attacker is tall and when the attacker is not tall:
\[ P(\text{witness identified tall}) = P(\text{witness identified tall} | \text{tall}) \cdot P(\text{tall}) + P(\text{witness identified tall} | \text{not tall}) \cdot P(\text{not tall}) \]
\[ P(\text{witness identified tall} | \text{not tall}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall, which is 0.20 (since the witness has an 80% success rate and a 20% error rate).

So:
\[ P(\text{witness identified tall}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{witness identified tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{witness identified tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
