To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the formula for Bayes' Theorem to find the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's define the probabilities given in the problem:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm = 0.85 (since the total must equal 1).

The witness's accuracy given in the problem is:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are under 185 cm = 0.2.

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness says someone is 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.29
\]

Now, we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \}
\]
