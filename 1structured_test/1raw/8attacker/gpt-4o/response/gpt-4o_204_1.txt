To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Given:
- Probability of an attacker being under 185 cm (\(P(A_{\text{<185}})\)) = 0.85
- Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (\(P(A_{\text{≥185}})\)) = 0.15

From the witness:
- Probability of correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (\(P(E | A_{\text{≥185}})\)) = 0.80
- Probability of incorrectly identifying a person who is under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (\(P(E | A_{\text{<185}})\)) = 0.20

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (\(P(A_{\text{≥185}} | E)\)).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{≥185}} | E) = \frac{P(E | A_{\text{≥185}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{≥185}})}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to compute \(P(E)\), the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E | A_{\text{≥185}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{≥185}}) + P(E | A_{\text{<185}}) \cdot P(A_{\text{<185}}) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A_{\text{≥185}} | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{≥185}} | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A_{\text{≥185}} | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
