We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Let's denote the following:

- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \sim H \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to define our probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, the population is equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, given the attack scenario:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\sim H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

2. The witness’s ability to correctly identify a person's height:
   - \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (80% probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(E|\sim H) = 0.20 \) (20% probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\sim H) \cdot P(\sim H) \]

Now, we insert the known values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
