To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( T \geq 185 \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_{185} \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- \( P(T \geq 185) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(T < 185) = 0.5 \)
- Probability the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_{185} | T \geq 185) = 0.8 \)
- Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_{185} | T < 185) = 0.2 \)
- Proportion of attackers under 185 cm: \( P(T < 185 | \text{attack}) = 0.85 \)
- Proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller: \( P(T \geq 185 | \text{attack}) = 0.15 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W_{185}) = \frac{P(W_{185} | T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(W_{185})} \]

Where \( P(W_{185}) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the person as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_{185}) = P(W_{185} | T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(W_{185} | T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]
\[ P(W_{185}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W_{185}) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W_{185}) = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W_{185}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W_{185}) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W_{185}) = 0.8 \]

So, based on the given information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
