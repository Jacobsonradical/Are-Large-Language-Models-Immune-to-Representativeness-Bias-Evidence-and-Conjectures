Given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event \( H \)) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event \( W \)).

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|W) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is given as 80% (0.80).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% (0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|\neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is 20% (0.20).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (0.85).

Let's plug in the numbers:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is roughly 0.414.
