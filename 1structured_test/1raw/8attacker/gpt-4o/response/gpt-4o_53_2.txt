To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the provided information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (the probability that any randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
