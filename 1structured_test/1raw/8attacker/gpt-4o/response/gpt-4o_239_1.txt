To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information provided:

1. The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller (true positive) or shorter (false positive):
   - True positive rate: 80% (or 0.8)
   - False positive rate: 20% (or 0.2)

2. The prior probabilities regarding the population of attackers:
   - Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm: 85% (or 0.85)
   - Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller: 15% (or 0.15)

3. Witness's identification:
   - Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \, | \, \text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = \frac{P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185 \, | \, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185)} \]

We can express the denominator using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185 \, | \, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185 \, | \, H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

Substitute in the known values:

\[ P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute it back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \, | \, \text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \, | \, \text{identified} \, H \geq 185) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \, | \, \text{identified} \, H \geq 185) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
