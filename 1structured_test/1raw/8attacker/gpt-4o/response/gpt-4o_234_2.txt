To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Here’s a step-by-step solution:

1. **Define Events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
   - Let \( B \) be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(A') = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person as such)
   - \( P(B | A') = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem states:
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   
   Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A')
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.29
   \]
   
4. **Calculate \( P(A | B) \):**
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A | B) \approx 0.414
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
