To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies height as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies height as 185 cm or taller).

We also know the following:
- \( P(H|attack) = 0.15 \) (the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H|attack) = 0.85 \) (the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

We aim to find \( P(H|W, attack) \).

To find this probability, we'll use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W, attack) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H|attack)}{P(W|attack)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W|attack) \):
\[ P(W|attack) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H|attack) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H|attack) \]
\[ P(W|attack) = (0.8) \cdot (0.15) + (0.2) \cdot (0.85) \]
\[ P(W|attack) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W|attack) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W, attack) \):
\[ P(H|W, attack) = \frac{(0.8) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W, attack) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W, attack) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the attack statistics, is approximately 0.4138.

Formatted answer:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
