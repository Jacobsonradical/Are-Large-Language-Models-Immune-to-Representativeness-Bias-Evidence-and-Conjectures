To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and can be stated as follows:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification (B).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:

1. The prior probabilities (\( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \)):
   \[ P(A) = 0.5 \]  (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(\neg A) = 0.5 \] (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

2. The likelihoods (\( P(B|A) \) and \( P(B|\neg A) \)):
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]  (probability that the witness correctly identifies height as 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \] (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies height as 185 cm or taller)

3. Base rates for attack (\( P(A \cap C) \) and \( P(\neg A \cap C) \)):
   \[ P(A \cap C) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075 \] (probability that the person is 185 cm or taller and an attacker)
   \[ P(\neg A \cap C) = 0.5 * 0.85 = 0.425 \] (probability that the person is shorter than 185 cm and an attacker)

First, we calculate \( P(B) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, given the witness's identification and their accuracy rate, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
