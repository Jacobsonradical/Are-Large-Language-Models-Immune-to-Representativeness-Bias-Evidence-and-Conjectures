To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( A^c \) as the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm".
- \( W \) as the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

Given:

1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \) — half the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(A^c) = 0.5 \) — half the population is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \) — the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
4. \( P(W|A^c) = 0.2 \) — the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
5. \(P(A|attack) = 0.15\) — 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To find the overall probability \( P(A|W) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.41.
