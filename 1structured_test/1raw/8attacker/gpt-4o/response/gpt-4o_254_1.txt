To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate each component:

1. \( P(T) \) and \( P( \neg T) \):

From the information, we know:
- \( P( \neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)

2. \( P(W|T) \) and \( P(W| \neg T) \):

The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, making an error 20% of the time.

- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are)
- \( P(W| \neg T) = 0.2 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

3. \(P(W)\):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W| \neg T) \cdot P( \neg T) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
