To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define our events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

1. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) \):
\[ P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

2. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\text{not A}) \):
\[ P(\text{attacker is shorter than 185 cm}) = \frac{1}{2} \]

3. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(B | A) \):
\[ P(B | A) = 0.80 \]

4. The likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter, \( P(B | \text{not A}) \):
\[ P(B | \text{not A}) = 0.20 \]

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \text{not A}) \cdot P(\text{not A}) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.50) + (0.20 \cdot 0.50) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.50 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.50}{0.50} \]
\[ P(A | B) = 0.80 \]

Given all these calculations, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
