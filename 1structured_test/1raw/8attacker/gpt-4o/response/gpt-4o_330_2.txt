To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate each term separately.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) P(T) + P(W | \neg T) P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
