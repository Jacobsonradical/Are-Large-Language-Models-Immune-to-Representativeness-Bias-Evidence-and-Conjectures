Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_{\text{185+}} \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) = \frac{P(W_{\text{185+}}|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_{\text{185+}})} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_{\text{185+}}|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_{\text{185+}}) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_{\text{185+}}|A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_{\text{185+}}|B) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Next, we compute \( P(W_{\text{185+}}) \):

\[ P(W_{\text{185+}}) = P(W_{\text{185+}}|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_{\text{185+}}|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W_{\text{185+}}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_{\text{185+}}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_{\text{185+}}) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) \):

\[ P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_{\text{185+}}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
