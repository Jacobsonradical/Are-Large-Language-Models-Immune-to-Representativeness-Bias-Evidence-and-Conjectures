To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:

1. \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller is 80%.
2. \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is 20%.
3. \( P(T) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15%).
4. \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85%).

We want to find \( P(T | W) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ {probability: 0.41} \]
