To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W|A^c) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|A^c)P(A^c) \]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|W) \):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.
