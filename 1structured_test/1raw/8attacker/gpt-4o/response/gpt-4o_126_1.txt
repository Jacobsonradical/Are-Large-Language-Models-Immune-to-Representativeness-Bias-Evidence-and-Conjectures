To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- The prior probability \( P(H_1) \) that the attacker is under 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).
- The prior probability \( P(H_2) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

Let:
- \( E \) be the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- The probability \( P(E | H_1) \) that the witness identifies a person under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (false positive) is 0.20 (20% error rate).
- The probability \( P(E | H_2) \) that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller (true positive) is 0.80 (80% correct rate).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need the posterior probability \( P(H_2 | E) \):

\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Let's plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.20) \cdot (0.85) + (0.80) \cdot (0.15) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.17 + 0.12 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H_2 | E) \):

\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_2 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
