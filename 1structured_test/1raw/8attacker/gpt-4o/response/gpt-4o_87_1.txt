To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is roughly equal).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is roughly equal).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
