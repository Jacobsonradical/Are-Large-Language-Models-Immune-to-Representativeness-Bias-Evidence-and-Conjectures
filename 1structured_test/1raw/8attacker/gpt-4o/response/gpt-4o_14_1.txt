To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( P(H \geq 185) \) be the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.80 \) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185 \mid H < 185) = 0.20 \) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185)} \]

We need \( P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185) \):
\[ P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185 \mid H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid \text{Witness says } H \geq 185) \approx 0.4138 \]

So our estimate of the probability is:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
