To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here, we have:
- \( P(E \mid H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

We want \( P(H \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H)} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{(0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
