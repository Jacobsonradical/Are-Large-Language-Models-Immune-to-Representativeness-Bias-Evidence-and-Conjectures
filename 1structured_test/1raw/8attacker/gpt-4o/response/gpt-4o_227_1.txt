To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

- The prior probabilities are \( P(T) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- The probabilities of attacking given height are \( P(\text{attack} | T) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\text{attack} | \neg T) = 0.85 \).
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller is \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) and incorrectly as 185 cm or taller is \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \).

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting in the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
