To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define our events and use the given probabilities to structure our calculation.

1. Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since population distribution is equal for height).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (where \( \neg T \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).
- \( P(\neg W \mid T) = 0.2 \) (witness makes an error 20% of the time).
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness misidentifies shorter person as tall 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg W \mid \neg T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies shorter people 80% of the time).

Also, given the specific attack statistics:
- \( P(A \mid \neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).
- \( P(A \mid T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

We need to account for these in our calculation.

First, we find the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T)P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T)P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = 0.8 \]

Since we also need to factor in the specific attack statistics, we should incorporate those to adjust the probability.

We replace \( P(T) \) and \( P(\neg T) \) with \( P(T \mid A) \) and \( P(\neg T \mid A) \):

For \( P(T\mid A) = 0.15 \) given attacker specific stats:
\[ P(\neg T \mid A) = 0.85 \]

Thus making:
\[ P(T) = 0.5 \]

Final probability adjusted:
- Revised Bayes theorem:

Thus for \( T\mid W, sentence corrected \):
\[ P(T \mid W) = ( T) = 0.15 \text{applied}. \]

Finally, correcting:
\[ = P(T \mid W) = {(P(T\mid W)( 0.15).]{\frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.5} = 0.8} )-]}\{.15P(T \mid W). \]

So correct re-adjusted calculation final answer:
# {
