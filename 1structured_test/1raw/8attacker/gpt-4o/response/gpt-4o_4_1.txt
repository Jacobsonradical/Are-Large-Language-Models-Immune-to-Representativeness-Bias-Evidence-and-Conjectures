To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are).
4. \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be determined using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

Calculating \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

Hence, the estimate is:
