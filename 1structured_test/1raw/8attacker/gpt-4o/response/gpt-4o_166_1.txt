To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

From the provided information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally split)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness misidentifies height 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(W) \), which is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now compute \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is \( \text{probability: } 0.8 \).
