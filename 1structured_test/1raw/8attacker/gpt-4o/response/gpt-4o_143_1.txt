We can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:

1. \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the witness accuracy:
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
