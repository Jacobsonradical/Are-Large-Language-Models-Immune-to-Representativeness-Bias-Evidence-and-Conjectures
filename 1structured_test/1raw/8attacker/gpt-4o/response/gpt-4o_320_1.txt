To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population split is roughly equal)
  - \( P(N) = 0.5 \)

- Probabilities related to the attack:
  - \( P(A|T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(A|N) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

- Witness identification accuracy:
  - \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (correctly identifies tall person 80% of the time)
  - \( P(W|N) = 0.2 \) (incorrectly identifies short person as tall 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | N) \cdot P(N) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, compute \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.8 \} \]
