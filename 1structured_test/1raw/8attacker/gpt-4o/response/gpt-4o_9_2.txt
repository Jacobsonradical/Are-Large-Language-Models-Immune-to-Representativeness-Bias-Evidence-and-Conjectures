To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H \mid W) \), where \( H \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Here's how we can determine each term:

1. **\( P(H) \) - Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller**:
   - Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **\( P(\neg H) \) - Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm**:
   - Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

3. **\( P(W \mid H) \) - Likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller**:
   - The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \).

4. **\( P(W \mid \neg H) \) - Likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm**:
   - The witness errs in 20% of cases, so \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \).

5. **\( P(W) \) - Total probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller**:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.414\}
