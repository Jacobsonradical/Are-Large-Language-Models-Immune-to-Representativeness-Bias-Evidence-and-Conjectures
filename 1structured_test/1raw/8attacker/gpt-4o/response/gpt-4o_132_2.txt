To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(T_{tall}\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(T_{short}\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_{tall}\): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

1. The prior probabilities:
    - \( P(T_{tall}) = 0.5 \) (since the population is evenly split between those shorter and those taller than 185 cm)
    - \( P(T_{short}) = 0.5 \)

2. The probabilities relevant to attackers:
    - \( P(T_{tall} | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \)
    - \( P(T_{short} | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \)

3. The witness's accuracy:
    - \( P(W_{tall} | T_{tall}) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(W_{tall} | T_{short}) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is:

\[ 
P(T_{tall} | W_{tall}) = \frac{P(W_{tall} | T_{tall}) \cdot P(T_{tall})}{P(W_{tall})}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(W_{tall}) \), the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being tall:

\[ 
P(W_{tall}) = P(W_{tall} | T_{tall}) \cdot P(T_{tall}) + P(W_{tall} | T_{short}) \cdot P(T_{short})
\]
\[
P(W_{tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_{tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W_{tall}) = 0.29
\]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T_{tall} | W_{tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T_{tall} | W_{tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T_{tall} | W_{tall}) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
