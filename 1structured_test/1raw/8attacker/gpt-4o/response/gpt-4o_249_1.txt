This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem, which combines prior probabilities with likelihoods to give a posterior probability.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

From the problem, we know: 
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies taller attackers 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter attackers as taller 20% of the time)

Now, let's find \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
