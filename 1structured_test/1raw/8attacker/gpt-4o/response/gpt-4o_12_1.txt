To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's break down the relevant probabilities first.

1. **P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
   Given that the population is split roughly equally:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.5
   \]

2. **P(H'): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.**
   \[
   P(H') = 0.5
   \]

3. **P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.**
   Given the witness's accuracy:
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

4. **P(E|H'): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.**
   Given the witness's error rate:
   \[
   P(E|H') = 0.2
   \]

5. **P(A|H): The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the attack occurred and 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.**
   Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(A|H) = 0.15
   \]

6. **P(A|H'): The probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.**
   \[
   P(A|H') = 1 - P(A|H) = 0.85
   \]

We want to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|E) \), that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given by:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H') \cdot P(H')
\]

Substituting the values, we get:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]

Evaluating the probabilities:
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we use this in the formula for Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
