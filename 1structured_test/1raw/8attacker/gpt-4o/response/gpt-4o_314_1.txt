To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Define:
- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we determine the individual components:
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability of \( H_1 \) (attacker is 185 cm or taller), which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability of \( H_2 \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm), which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter. This is given as 20% or 0.2.

Next, calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \), which is the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore:

{probability: 0.414}
