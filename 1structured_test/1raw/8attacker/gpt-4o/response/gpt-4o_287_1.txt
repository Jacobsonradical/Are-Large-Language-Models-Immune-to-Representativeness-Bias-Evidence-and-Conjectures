To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to compute \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Now we need to calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
