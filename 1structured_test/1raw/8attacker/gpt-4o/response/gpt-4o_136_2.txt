To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(A \text{ given the attacker's height is known}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A \text{ given the attacker's height is known}) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(A | W) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to determine \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substituting the given probabilities:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A | W) \):

\[
P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.8}
\]
