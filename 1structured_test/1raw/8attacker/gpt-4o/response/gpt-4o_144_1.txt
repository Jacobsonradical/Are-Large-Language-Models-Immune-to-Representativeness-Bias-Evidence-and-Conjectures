To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information we have:

- \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Attack}) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they have committed the attack, which is initially 15%.
- \( P(\text{Short} | \text{Attack}) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given they have committed the attack, which is initially 85%.
- \( P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Short}) = 0.2 \)
- The population split is roughly equal for people under and over 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Witness says Tall})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Witness says Tall}) = P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]

Given:
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Short}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness says Tall} | \text{Short}) = 0.2 \)

Calculate \( P(\text{Witness says Tall}) \):
\[ P(\text{Witness says Tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Witness says Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) \):
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness says Tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
