To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We aim to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

From the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (where \( A^c \) represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply the values to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
