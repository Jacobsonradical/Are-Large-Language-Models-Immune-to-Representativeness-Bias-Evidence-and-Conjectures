To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

### Let's denote:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.
- \( P(S | T) \): The probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80.
- \( P(S | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20.

We want to find \( P(T | S) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | S) = \frac{P(S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(S)} \]

To compute \( P(S) \) (the total probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(S) = P(S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(S | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(S) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.29 \]

### Now, we can find \( P(T | S) \):
\[ P(T | S) = \frac{P(S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(S)} \]
\[ P(T | S) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | S) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | S) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

### The answer in the specified format:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
