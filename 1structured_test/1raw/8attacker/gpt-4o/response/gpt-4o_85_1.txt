We need to use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the relevant statistics.

Let's define:
- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)} \]

From the description, we know:
- \( P(T) =\frac{1}{2} \) (since the population is evenly divided).
- \( P(\neg T) =\frac{1}{2} \).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness erroneously identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Plugging these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{0.8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0.2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} \]

Simplify the denominator:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So,

\{probability: 0.8\}
