To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness identification).

Let's define:
- \( H_t \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_t \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_s \): The witness identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_t) = 0.5 \) (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the population)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.5 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the population)
- \( P(Attack|H_t) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are an attacker)
- \( P(Attack|H_s) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given they are an attacker)
- \( P(W_t|H_t) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_s|H_t) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_t|H_s) = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_s|H_s) = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)

We are asked to find \( P(H_t|W_t, Attack) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such and given the attack occurred.

Firstly, we need to calculate \( P(W_t|Attack) \), the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W_t|Attack) = P(W_t|H_t)P(H_t|Attack) + P(W_t|H_s)P(H_s|Attack) \]
\[ P(W_t|Attack) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_t|Attack) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Next, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_t|W_t, Attack) = \frac{P(W_t|H_t)P(H_t|Attack)}{P(W_t|Attack)} \]
\[ P(H_t|W_t, Attack) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t|W_t, Attack) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the solution is:
