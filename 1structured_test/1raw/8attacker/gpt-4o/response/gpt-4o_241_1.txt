To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Let's break down the problem into the prior probability and the likelihood of the witness's testimony, and then compute the posterior probability.

Assuming:
- Event \(A\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event \(B\): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- The prior probability that someone is under 185 cm or 185 cm and taller is equal, so:
  - \(P(A) = 0.5\)
  - \(P(\neg A) = 0.5\)

- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so:
  - \(P(\neg A | \text{attacker}) = 0.85\)
  - \(P(A | \text{attacker}) = 0.15\)

- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20%, so:
  - \(P(B | A) = 0.8\)
  - \(P(B | \neg A) = 0.2\)

We want to find \(P(A | B)\). By Bayes' theorem:
\[P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\]

First, we need to calculate the marginal probability \(P(B)\):
\[P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)\]
\[P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5\]
\[P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1\]
\[P(B) = 0.5\]

Now we can plug \(P(B)\), \(P(B | A)\), and \(P(A)\) into Bayes' theorem:
\[P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5}\]
\[P(A | B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5}\]
\[P(A | B) = 0.8\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.

Therefore:

\[{\text{probability: } 0.8}\]
