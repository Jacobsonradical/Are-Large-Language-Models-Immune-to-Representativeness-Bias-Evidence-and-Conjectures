To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes’ theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to define the probabilities given in the information:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, compute \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.41} \} \]
