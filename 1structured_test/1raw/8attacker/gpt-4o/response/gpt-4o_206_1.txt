To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E\): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \(P(H_1)\) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(H_2)\) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(E|H_1)\) = 0.80 (probability the witness correctly identified someone as 185 cm or taller when they are).
- \(P(E|H_2)\) = 0.20 (probability the witness incorrectly identified someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).

We want \(P(H_1|E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1)P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Now we need to find \(P(E)\):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E|H_2)P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \(P(H_1|E)\):

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
