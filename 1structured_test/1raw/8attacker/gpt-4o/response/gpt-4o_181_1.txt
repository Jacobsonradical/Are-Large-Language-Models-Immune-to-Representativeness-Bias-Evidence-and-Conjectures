To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

We have:
- Witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate when judging people in similar conditions.
- Population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, while 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using the given data, we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (Prob that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (Prob that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find \( P(A|W) \) – the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer is:

{ "probability": 0.4138 }
