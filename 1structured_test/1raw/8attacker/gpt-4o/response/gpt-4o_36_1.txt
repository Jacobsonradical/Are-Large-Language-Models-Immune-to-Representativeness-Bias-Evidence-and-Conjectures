To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is given as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A^c) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
