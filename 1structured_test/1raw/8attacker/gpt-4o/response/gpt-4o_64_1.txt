Sure, let's approach this problem using Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(H_1) \): Prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( P(H_2) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to the population distribution, these probabilities are equal:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)

However, given the attack case statistics:
- \( P(A|H_1) = 0.85 \): Probability that the attacker is under 185 cm given an attack.
- \( P(A|H_2) = 0.15 \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given an attack.

Given the witness's identification:
- \( P(W|H_1) = 0.20 \) (20% chance of misidentifying an under-185 cm person as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|H_2) = 0.80 \) (80% chance of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person).

We need to calculate the updated probability \( P(H_2|W) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statement.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_2|W) = \frac{P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.20 \cdot 0.5) + (0.80 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.1 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_2|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_2|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_2|W) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Thus, the response is:
{probability: 0.8}
