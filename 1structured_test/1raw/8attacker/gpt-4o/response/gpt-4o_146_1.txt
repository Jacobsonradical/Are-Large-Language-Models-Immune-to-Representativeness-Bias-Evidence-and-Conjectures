To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

1. The population is such that the number of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal. Hence, \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \).

2. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(A| \text{attack}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\neg A| \text{attack}) = 0.85 \)

3. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time:
   - \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (since 20% error rate implies that if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.41 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
