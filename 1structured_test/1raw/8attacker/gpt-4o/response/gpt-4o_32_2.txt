To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's denote:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- The prior probability \( P(T) = 0.5 \).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \).
- The probability of being identified correctly if 185 cm or taller \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \).
- The probability of being identified incorrectly if under 185 cm \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \).

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(T | W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

However, \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness's identification) needs to be computed first:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8.

Thus, the format requested can be expressed as:
