To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is split equally in height).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (the complementary probability).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies height if the attacker is shorter).

We want to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.5) + (0.20 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.5}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.80 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.80.

Therefore, the response formatted as requested is:
{probability: 0.8}
