To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( T_1 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( T_2 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T_2 | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T_1) = 0.85 \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(T_2) = 0.15 \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | T_1) = 0.20 \), the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | T_2) = 0.80 \), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T_2 | W) = \frac{P(W | T_2) \cdot P(T_2)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T_1) \cdot P(T_1) + P(W | T_2) \cdot P(T_2) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.20 \cdot 0.85) + (0.80 \cdot 0.15) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.17 + 0.12 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T_2 | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_2 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_2 | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
