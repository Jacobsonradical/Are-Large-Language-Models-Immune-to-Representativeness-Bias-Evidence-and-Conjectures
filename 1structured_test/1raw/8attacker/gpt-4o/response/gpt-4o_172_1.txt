To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(T) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W | T) \): Likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W) \): Total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time for those shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \). Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
