To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Specifically, we need to calculate the posterior probability given the witness's identification. The theorem can be expressed as:

\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

where:
- \( H_1 \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W | H_1) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
1. Prior probability: \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \)
2. Prior probability: \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \) (where \( H_2 \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. Likelihood: \( P(W | H_1) = 0.8 \)
4. Likelihood: \( P(W | H_2) = 0.2 \)
5. \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = 0.8 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
