To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem updates our prior belief based on new evidence.

Given:
- The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller: P(Taller) = 0.5
- The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm: P(Shorter) = 0.5
- The likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given an attack: P(Attack | Taller) = 0.15
- The likelihood of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given an attack: P(Attack | Shorter) = 0.85
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker: P(WitnessCorrect | Taller) = 0.8
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a tall attacker: P(WitnessWrong | Taller) = 0.2
- The probability of the witness correctly identifying a shorter attacker: P(WitnessCorrect | Shorter) = 0.8
- The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker: P(WitnessWrong | Shorter) = 0.2
- Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We seek \( P(Taller | Witness \text{ sees attacker as tall}) \).

First, let's compute the marginal probability that the witness sees the attacker as being tall using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(Witness \text{ sees tall}) = P(Witness \text{ sees tall} | Taller) \cdot P(Taller) + P(Witness \text{ sees tall} | Shorter) \cdot P(Shorter)
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
P(Witness \text{ sees tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(Witness \text{ sees tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(Taller | Witness \text{ sees tall}) \) using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(Taller | Witness \text{ sees tall}) = \frac{P(Witness \text{ sees tall} | Taller) \cdot P(Taller)}{P(Witness \text{ sees tall})}
\]

\[
P(Taller | Witness \text{ sees tall}) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
