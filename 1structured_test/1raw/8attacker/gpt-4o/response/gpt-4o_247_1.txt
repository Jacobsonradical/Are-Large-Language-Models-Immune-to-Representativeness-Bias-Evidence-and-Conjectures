We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80%, or 0.8).
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 15%, or 0.15).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Where:
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 20%, or 0.2).
- \( P(\neg T) \) is the prior probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 85%, or 0.85).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.4138.

So, the answer is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
