To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s how we break it down:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Known Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b).
   - \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (from information b).
   - \( P(W|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller is 0.80 (from information a).
   - \( P(W|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 0.20 (since the witness misidentifies 20% of the time).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**

   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]

   Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

   \[
   P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

   Now, substituting \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]

   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
