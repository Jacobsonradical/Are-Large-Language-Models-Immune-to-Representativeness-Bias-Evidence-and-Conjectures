To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. Let's denote the following:

- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|H_1) \): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H_2) \): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1|E) \): The posterior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as such (this is what we want to find).

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (the proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
