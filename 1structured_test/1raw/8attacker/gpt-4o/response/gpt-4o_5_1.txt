To address the problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \(A\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(B\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \(W\): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \(P(A) = 0.5\) (since the population is equally split between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
   - \(P(B) = 0.5\) (since the population is equally split)

   For attackers:
   - \(P(\text{attack} \mid A) = 0.15\)
   - \(P(\text{attack} \mid B) = 0.85\)

   Probability of being identified as 185 cm or taller:
   - \(P(W \mid A) = 0.8\)
   - \(P(W \mid B) = 0.2\)

3. **Calculate the prior probabilities of being the attacker for each group:**
   - \(P(A \mid \text{attack}) = \frac{P(\text{attack} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{attack})}\)
   - \(P(B \mid \text{attack}) = \frac{P(\text{attack} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(\text{attack})}\)

   Where \(P(\text{attack}) = P(\text{attack} \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{attack} \mid B) \cdot P(B) = 0.15 \cdot 0.5 + 0.85 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5\).

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find \(P(A \mid W)\):**
   - \(P(A \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid \text{attack})}{P(W \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid \text{attack}) + P(W \mid B) \cdot P(B \mid \text{attack})}\)

   Given:
   - \(P(A \mid \text{attack}) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.15\)
   - \(P(B \mid \text{attack}) = \frac{0.85 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = 0.85\)

   Putting it together:
   - \(P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{(0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)}\)

5. **Calculate:**
   - Numerator: \(0.8 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12\)
   - Denominator: \(0.12 + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\)
   - \(P(A \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138\)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
