To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to update our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the prior information. Let's break down the provided information and apply Bayes' Theorem.

1. **Prior Probability (P(T))**:
    - P(Taller) = 0.50
    - P(Shorter) = 0.50

2. **Likelihood (Witness Accuracy)**:
    - P(Witness says Taller | Taller) = 0.80 (80% accuracy)
    - P(Witness says Taller | Shorter) = 0.20 (20% error)

3. **Base Rates of Attackers**:
    - P(Attacker is Taller | Attacker) = 0.15
    - P(Attacker is Shorter | Attacker) = 0.85

However, since we are trying to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the likelihood of the witness's identification with the base rates of attackers.

We want to find:
\[ P(Taller | Witness) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Taller | Witness) = \frac{P(Witness|Taller) \times P(Taller)}{P(Witness)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(Witness) \):

\[ P(Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \times P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) \times P(Shorter) \]
\[ P(Witness) = (0.80 \times 0.50) + (0.20 \times 0.50) \]
\[ P(Witness) = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(Taller | Witness) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.50}{0.50} \]
\[ P(Taller | Witness) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(Taller | Witness) = 0.80 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is 0.80.

Hence, the answer is:
\[ \{probability: 0.80\} \]
