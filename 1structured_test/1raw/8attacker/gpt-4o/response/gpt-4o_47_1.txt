To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events as follows:

- \(T_{\geq 185}\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(T_{<185}\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
1. \(P(W | T_{\geq 185}) = 0.80\)
2. \(P(W | T_{<185}) = 0.20\)
3. \(P(T_{\geq 185}) = 0.15\)
4. \(P(T_{<185}) = 0.85\)

We are interested in \(P(T_{\geq 185} | W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(T_{\geq 185} | W) = \frac{P(W | T_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(T_{\geq 185})}{P(W)} \]

Where \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, calculated by:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(T_{\geq 185}) + P(W | T_{<185}) \cdot P(T_{<185}) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(T_{\geq 185} | W)\):

\[ P(T_{\geq 185} | W) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{\geq 185} | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{\geq 185} | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
