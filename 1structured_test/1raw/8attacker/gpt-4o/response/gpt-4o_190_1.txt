To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

First, calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, compute \( P(A|W) \):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\{probability: 0.414\}
