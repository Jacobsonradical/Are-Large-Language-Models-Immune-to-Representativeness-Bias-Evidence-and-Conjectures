To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is equal),
- \( P(L) = 0.5 \),
- \( P(W|H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height for tall people),
- \( P(W|L) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height for short people).

We want to calculate \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H|W) \):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
