To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we'll need to establish some prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

1. Prior probability \( P(H) \): The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that the population of people shorter and equal/above 185 cm is roughly equal, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.15
   \]

2. Prior probability \( P(H^c) \): The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   \[
   P(H^c) = 0.85
   \]

3. Likelihood \( P(E|H) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
   \[
   P(E|H) = 0.8
   \]

4. Likelihood \( P(E|H^c) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.
   \[
   P(E|H^c) = 0.2
   \]

Now, Bayes' Theorem states:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

To find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height:
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(E) = 0.29
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H|E) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]

or in the required format:

\{
  \text{probability}: 0.41
\}
