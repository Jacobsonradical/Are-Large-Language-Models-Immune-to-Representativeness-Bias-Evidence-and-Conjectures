To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence, which in this case is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|H) \) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Let \( \neg H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(\neg H) \) = 0.85 (the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be expanded as:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
