To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \(E\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We're looking to find \(P(E|W)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given:
- \(P(E) = 0.5\) (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
- \(P(\neg E) = 0.5\) (The complementary probability).
- \(P(W|E) = 0.8\) (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W|\neg E) = 0.2\) (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(E|attack) = 0.15\) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(\neg E|attack) = 0.85\) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(E|W) = \frac{P(W|E) \cdot P(E)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|E) \cdot P(E) + P(W|\neg E) \cdot P(\neg E) \]

First, we need to calculate \(P(W)\):
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to calculate \(P(E|W)\):
\[ P(E|W) = \frac{P(W|E) \cdot P(E)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(E|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(E|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(E|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \text{{probability}}: 0.8 \]
