We can use Bayesian inference to solve this problem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(A | B) \), we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies tall attackers 80% of the time).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (witness mistakenly identifies attackers shorter than 185 cm as tall 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

First, we compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
