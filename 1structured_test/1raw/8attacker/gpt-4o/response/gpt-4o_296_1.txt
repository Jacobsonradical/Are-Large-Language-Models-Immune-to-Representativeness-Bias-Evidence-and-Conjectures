To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

- Let \( T \) represent that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( \overline{T} \) represent that the attacker is under 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) represent that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{T}) = 0.85 \) (the probability that an attacker is under 185 cm)
- The witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (\( P(W|T) = 0.80 \)).
- The witness incorrectly identifies the height as taller for those under 185 cm 20% of the time (\( P(W|\overline{T}) = 0.20 \)).

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\overline{T}) \cdot P(\overline{T})}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85}
\]

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
\]

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
