To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we know the following information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (The percentage of people 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (The percentage of people shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (The probability the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Plugging in the values we have:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, we can compute \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[
{probability: 0.8}
\]
