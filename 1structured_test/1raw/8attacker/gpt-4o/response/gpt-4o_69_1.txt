To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

We need to calculate each part of this equation:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (Population portion taller than 185 cm)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (Population portion shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood of the witness's identification**:
   - Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies them as such 80% of the time: \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \)
   - Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: \( P(W|\neg A) = 0.2 \)

3. **Total Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller**:
   - This is calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is \(0.8\).
