To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the information about the general population and typical attacker heights, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the two events:
- \( H \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H|E) \), where \( E \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we need the likelihoods:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of people 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Now, we calculate the numerator and the denominator:

Numerator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]

Denominator:
\[ (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.41 \} \]
