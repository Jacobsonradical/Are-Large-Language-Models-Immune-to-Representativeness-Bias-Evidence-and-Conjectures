To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information at hand, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- Let \(T\) be the event that the attacker is \(185 \, \text{cm or taller}\).
- Let \(W\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being \(185 \, \text{cm or taller}\).

We want to find \(P(T|W)\), the probability that the attacker is \(185 \, \text{cm or taller}\) given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(W|T)\) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller: \(0.8\).
- \(P(T)\) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller: \(0.15\) (from the given data where only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To find \(P(W)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Where:
- \(P(W|\neg T)\) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies an attacker who is under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller: \(0.2\) (since they correctly identify the height in 80% of cases, they err in 20%).
- \(P(\neg T)\) is the prior probability that an attacker is under 185 cm: \(0.85\).

So:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \(P(T|W)\):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately \(0.4138\).

So the final answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
