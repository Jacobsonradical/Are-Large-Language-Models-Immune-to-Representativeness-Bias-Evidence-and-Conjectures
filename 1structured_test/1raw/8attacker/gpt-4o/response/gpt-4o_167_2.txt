We can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \(H1\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(H2\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
1. The prior probabilities are:
   - \(P(H1) = 0.5\) (because the population is split equally between under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
   - \(P(H2) = 0.5\)
   
2. The likelihoods are:
   - \(P(E | H1) = 0.2\) (because the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, therefore incorrectly identifies 20% of the time)
   - \(P(E | H2) = 0.8\) (because the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

We want to find the posterior probability \(P(H2 | E)\), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[P(H2 | E) = \frac{P(E | H2) \cdot P(H2)}{P(E)}.\]

To find \(P(E)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[P(E) = P(E | H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E | H2) \cdot P(H2).\]

Substituting the values:
\[P(E) = (0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.8 \cdot 0.5) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5.\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[P(H2 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8.\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[{probability: 0.8}.\]
