To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the statistical data provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is formulated as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
3. The witness's accuracy for identifying someone of 185 cm or taller \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
4. The witness's error rate for identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as taller \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \).

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
