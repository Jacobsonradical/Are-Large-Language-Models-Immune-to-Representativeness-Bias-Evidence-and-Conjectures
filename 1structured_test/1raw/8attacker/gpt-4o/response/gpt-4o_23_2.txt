To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break down the problem:

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ 
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} 
\]

Where:
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually that height.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's calculate these one by one.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - We know that the population is roughly equally divided.
   - Therefore, \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller: \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \).
   - The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller: \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \).

3. **Total probability \( P(E) \)**:
   \[ 
   P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) 
   \]
   \[
   P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 
   \]

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is \( 0.8 \).

Final answer format:
{probability: 0.8}
