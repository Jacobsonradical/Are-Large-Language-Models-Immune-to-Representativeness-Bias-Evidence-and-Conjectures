To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's summarize the given information and apply the theorem step by step.

**Given:**
- Prior probabilities:
  - P(T < 185) = 0.85 (85% of attackers shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(T ≥ 185) = 0.15 (15% of attackers 185 cm or taller)
- Witness's accuracy:
  - P(W = tall | T ≥ 185) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
  - P(W = tall | T < 185) = 0.20 (witness makes an error 20% of the time)
- Nation's population height distribution is roughly equal:
  - P(T < 185) = 0.50
  - P(T ≥ 185) = 0.50

**We need to find:**
- P(T ≥ 185 | W = tall), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness stating that the attacker was tall.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T ≥ 185 | W = tall) = \frac{P(W = tall | T ≥ 185)P(T ≥ 185)}{P(W = tall)} \]

Where \( P(W = tall) \) (the total probability that the witness says the attacker is tall) can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(W = tall) = P(W = tall | T ≥ 185)P(T ≥ 185) + P(W = tall | T < 185)P(T < 185) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W = tall) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W = tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W = tall) = 0.29 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T ≥ 185 | W = tall) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T ≥ 185 | W = tall) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T ≥ 185 | W = tall) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
