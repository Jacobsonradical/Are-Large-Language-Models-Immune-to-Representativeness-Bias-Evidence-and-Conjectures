To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we will use Bayes' Theorem. We will denote:
- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller initially, given the population distribution)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.5 \) (Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm initially)
- \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identified height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identified height if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | E) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given by:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | E) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
