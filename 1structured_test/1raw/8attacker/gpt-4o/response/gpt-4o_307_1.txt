To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. The theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
