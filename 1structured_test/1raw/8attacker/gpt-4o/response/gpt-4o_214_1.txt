To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define some events based on the given information:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Overall probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

- \( P(A) \): The probability that someone is 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equally split, \( P(A) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller. Given as 80%, so \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm, which is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller. Given as 20%, so \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \).

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
