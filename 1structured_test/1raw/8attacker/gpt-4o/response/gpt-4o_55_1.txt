To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. We have two possible scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event \( H \)) and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (event \( \bar{H} \)).

Given:
- The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- The witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\bar{H}) = 0.85 \): the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \): the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\bar{H}) = 0.20 \): the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

We are required to find the posterior probability \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\bar{H}) \cdot P(\bar{H}) \]

Let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
