To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

- \( P(A_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A_2) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | A_1) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | A_2) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find \( P(A_1 | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A_1|W) = \frac{P(W|A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(W | A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A_1 | W) \):

\[ P(A_1|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A_1|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A_1|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
