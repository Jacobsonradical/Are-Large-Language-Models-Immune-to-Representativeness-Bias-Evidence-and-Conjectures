To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (the witness's identification).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying an attacker 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller without considering the witness's identification, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

To calculate \( P(E) \):

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Where:
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the likelihood of the witness mistakenly identifying an attacker under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Let's plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
