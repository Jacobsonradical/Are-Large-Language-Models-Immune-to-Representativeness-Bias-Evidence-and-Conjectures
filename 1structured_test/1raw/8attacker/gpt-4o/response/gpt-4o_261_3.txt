We can solve this problem by using Bayes' Theorem, which is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) : The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) : The witness identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given:

- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population split is roughly equal and no new information disrupts this prior for attack incidents by itself).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg W|T) = 0.2 \) (the witness misses identifying height 20% of the time).
- \( P(\neg W|\neg T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is 0.8.

\[
\{probability: 0.8\}
\]
