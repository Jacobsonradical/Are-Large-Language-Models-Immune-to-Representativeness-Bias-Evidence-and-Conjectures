To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The provided information will help us update our probability assessments based on witness identification.

### Let's define the following terms:
- \( P( T \ge 185 ) \): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) \): Probability that the witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P( T \ge 185 | W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) \): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.

From the provided information, we have:
- Prior probability \( P( T < 185 ) = 0.5 \) and \( P( T \ge 185 ) = 0.5 \).
- Likelihood of attacker's height based on attack statistics: \( P( A | T < 185 ) = 0.85 \) and \( P( A | T \ge 185 ) = 0.15 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's height: \( P( W \text{ right } | T \ge 185 ) = 0.8 \) and \( P( W \text{ wrong } | T \ge 185 ) = 0.2 \).

### Calculate the likelihoods:
1. The witness correctly identifies a tall attacker (\(T \ge 185\)):
    \[
    P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 | T \ge 185 ) = 0.8
    \]

2. The witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker (\(T < 185\)) as tall:
    \[
    P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 | T < 185 ) = 0.2
    \]

### Use Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P( T \ge 185 | W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) = \frac{P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 | T \ge 185 ) \times P( T \ge 185 )}{P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 )}
\]

Where:
\[
P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) = P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 | T < 185 ) \times P( T < 185 ) + P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 | T \ge 185 ) \times P( T \ge 185 )
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
P( W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) = (0.2 \times 0.5) + (0.8 \times 0.5) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5
\]

Now, calculate \( P( T \ge 185 | W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) \):
\[
P( T \ge 185 | W \text{ said } T \ge 185 ) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

\[
\boxed{ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} }
\]
