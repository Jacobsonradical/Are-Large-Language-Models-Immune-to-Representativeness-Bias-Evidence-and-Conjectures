To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We're interested in finding \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Given the data:

1. The prior probability, \( P(A) \), that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 0.5 since the population is evenly split.
2. The conditional probability, \( P(B|A) \), that the witness correctly identifies a person of height 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
3. The conditional probability, \( P(B|\neg A) \), that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2.
4. The prior probability, \( P(\neg A) \), that a random person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.5.
5. Additionally, 85% of attackers are below 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This changes the prior probabilities for an attacker:
    - \( P(A_{\text{attacker}}) \) = 0.15
    - \( P(\neg A_{\text{attacker}}) \) = 0.85

Since we are dealing with probabilities specific to attackers, we adjust the "even distribution in population" with the attacker-specific priors. We need to calculate:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where \( P(B) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Given:
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(B|A) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \]

So, 

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.41} \]
