Let's use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Given:
- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Witness said height} \geq 185) \)
- \( P(\text{Height} < 185) = 0.85 \) (probability before witness statement)
- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (probability before witness statement)
- \( P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Height} \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Height} < 185) = 0.20 \)

We need to find:
- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Witness said height} \geq 185) \)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = \frac{P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Height} \geq 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185)}{P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185)} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Height} \geq 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185) + P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Height} < 185) \cdot P(\text{Height} < 185) \]

Plugging the numbers:

\[ P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, | \, \text{Witness said height} \geq 185) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
