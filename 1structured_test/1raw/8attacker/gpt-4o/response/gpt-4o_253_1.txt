To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We'll denote the events as follows:

- \( A: \) The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B: \) The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- The prior probability \( P(A) \): The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- The conditional probability \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as such.
- The conditional probability \( P(B|A^c) \): The probability that the witness mistakenly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

Specifically:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \)

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
