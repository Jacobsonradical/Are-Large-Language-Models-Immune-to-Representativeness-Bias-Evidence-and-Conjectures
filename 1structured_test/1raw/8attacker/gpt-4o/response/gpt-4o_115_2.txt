To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability of being taller than or equal to 185 cm)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness correctly identifies if taller than or equal to 185 cm)
- \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness incorrectly identifies if shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, compute \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.414 \} \]
