To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the background information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_1 | E) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the identification.
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's determine these probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time for 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time for shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Marginal probability \( P(E) \):**

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
