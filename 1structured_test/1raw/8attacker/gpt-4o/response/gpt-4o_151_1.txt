To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our estimate based on new evidence. In this case, the witness's testimony is the new evidence.

Given the information, we have:

1. **Prior probability** of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (\( P(T) \)):
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

2. **Likelihoods** based on the witness's accuracy:
   - If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time (\( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)).
   - If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (\( P(W | T') = 0.20 \)).

3. **The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller**.

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | T') \cdot P(T') \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
