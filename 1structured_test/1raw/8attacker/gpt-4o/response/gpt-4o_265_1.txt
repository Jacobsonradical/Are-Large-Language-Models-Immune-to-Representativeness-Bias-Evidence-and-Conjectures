To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to determine the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **P(A) and P(A')**:
   - P(A): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - P(A'): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(A') = 0.85 \]

2. **P(B|A) and P(B|A')**:
   - \( P(B|A) \): Probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(B|A') \): Probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm.

Given the witness's identification accuracy:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(B|A') = 0.20 \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(B) \)**:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A')P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

### Result
{probability: 0.414}
