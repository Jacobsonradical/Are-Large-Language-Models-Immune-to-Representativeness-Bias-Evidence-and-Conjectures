To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we need to update the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such. 

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- ~A: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- ~B: The witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = P(~A) = 0.5 \) (The population is roughly equally divided).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|~A) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We need to find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|~A) \cdot P(~A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.
