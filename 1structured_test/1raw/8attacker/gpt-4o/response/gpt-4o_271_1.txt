To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E \mid H_1) \) is the probability that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the attacker being identified as 185 cm or taller.

To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Where:
- \( P(E \mid H_2) \) is the probability that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(H_2) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
