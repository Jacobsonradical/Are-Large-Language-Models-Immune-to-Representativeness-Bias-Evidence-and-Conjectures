To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:
- \( H_t \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_t | W) \):
\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W)} \]

We have:
- \( P(H_t) \) = 0.15
- \( P(H_s) \) = 0.85
- \( P(W | H_t) \) = 0.80
- \( P(W | H_s) \) = 0.20
- \( P(W) \) is given by the law of total probability: 

\[ P(W) = P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]

Substitute the known values:
- \( P(W | H_t) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W | H_s) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \)

Calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_t | W) \):
\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W) \approx 0.41 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
