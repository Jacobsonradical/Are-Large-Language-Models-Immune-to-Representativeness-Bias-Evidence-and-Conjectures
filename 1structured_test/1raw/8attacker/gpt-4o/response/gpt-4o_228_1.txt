To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break it down step-by-step:

1. **Define the terms:**
   - \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller
   - \( B \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
   - \( W \): Witness reports attacker as 185 cm or taller

2. **Known information:**
   - P(A) = 0.5 (prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller)
   - P(B) = 0.5 (prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm)
   - P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller)
   - P(W|B) = 0.2 (probability witness incorrectly identifies shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

3. **Calculate P(W):** Total probability that the witness reports the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|B)P(B)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:** To find \( P(A|W) \),
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's report is 0.8.

So, the estimate is:

\{probability: 0.8\}
