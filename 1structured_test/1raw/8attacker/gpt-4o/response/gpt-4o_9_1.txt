To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Given:
- \( P(\text{witness says tall} \mid \text{tall}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{witness says tall} \mid \text{short}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{tall}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{short}) = 0.85 \)

We aim to find \( P(\text{tall} \mid \text{witness says tall}) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(\text{tall} \mid \text{witness says tall}) = \frac{P(\text{witness says tall} \mid \text{tall}) \cdot P(\text{tall})}{P(\text{witness says tall})} \]

To find \( P(\text{witness says tall}) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{witness says tall}) = P(\text{witness says tall} \mid \text{tall}) \cdot P(\text{tall}) + P(\text{witness says tall} \mid \text{short}) \cdot P(\text{short}) \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(\text{witness says tall}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{witness says tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{witness says tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{tall} \mid \text{witness says tall}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{tall} \mid \text{witness says tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{tall} \mid \text{witness says tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
