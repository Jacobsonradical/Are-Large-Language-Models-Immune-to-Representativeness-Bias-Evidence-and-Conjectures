To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's break down the information given:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller: \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood of Attackers' Heights Given Attacker's Height:**
   - Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(T|A) = 0.85 \)
   - Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(T|B) = 0.15 \)

3. **Witness Accuracy:**
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_A|A) = 0.8 \)
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_A|B) = 0.2 \)
   - Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_B|B) = 0.8 \)
   - Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_B|A) = 0.2 \)

We need to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W_B) = \frac{P(W_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W_B)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W_B) = P(W_B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_B|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(W_B) = P(W_B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_B|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W_B) = (0.2 \cdot 0.5) + (0.8 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W_B) = 0.1 + 0.4 \]
\[ P(W_B) = 0.5 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(B|W_B) = \frac{P(W_B|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W_B)} \]
\[ P(B|W_B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(B|W_B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
