We can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|H_1) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|H_2) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H_1|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

where

\[ P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

First, we calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1|W) \):

\[ P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
