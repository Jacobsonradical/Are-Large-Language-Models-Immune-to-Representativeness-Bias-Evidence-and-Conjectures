To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the relevant terms:

- \(P(H)\): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(L)\): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E|H)\): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E|L)\): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E)\): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we have:

- Half of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the other half is shorter:
  \(P(H) = 0.5\) and \(P(L) = 0.5\)

- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, while 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller:
  \(P(A|L) = 0.85\) and \(P(A|H) = 0.15\)
  
- The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time:
  \(P(E|H) = 0.80\) and \(P(E|L) = 0.20\)

We need to find \(P(H|E)\) â€” the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]

We need to calculate \(P(E)\):

\[P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|L) \cdot P(L)\]
\[P(E) = 0.80 \cdot 0.5 + 0.20 \cdot 0.5\]
\[P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1\]
\[P(E) = 0.5\]

Now we can find \(P(H|E)\):

\[P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.5}{0.5}\]
\[P(H|E) = \frac{0.40}{0.5}\]
\[P(H|E) = 0.8\]

Finally, let's account for the relative frequencies of attackers being shorter or taller. We need to revise our calculation as follows, considering attackers' heights:

- Let \(A\) represent the event that the individual is an attacker, with \(P(H') = 0.15\) and \(P(L') = 0.85\).

Now we find the combined probability using these frequencies and Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(H|E,A) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H')}{P(E|H) \cdot P(H') + P(E|L) \cdot P(L')}\]
\[P(H|E,A) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85}\]
\[P(H|E,A) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}\]
\[P(H|E,A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(H|E,A) \approx 0.41379\]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.41379}
