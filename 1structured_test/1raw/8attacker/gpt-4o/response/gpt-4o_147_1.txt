To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can utilize Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witness.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

1. \( P(E | H) \) (the probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are actually 185 cm or taller) is 80% or 0.80.
2. \( P(E | \neg H) \) (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter than 185 cm) is 20% or 0.20.
3. \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given by the attack statistics: only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
4. \( P(\neg H) \) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is then \( 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \).
5. To find \( P(E) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Let's compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | E) \):
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
