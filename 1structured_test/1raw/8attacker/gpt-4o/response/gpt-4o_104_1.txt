To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \(P(H \mid E)\) = 15%.
- Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \(P(S \mid E)\) = 85%.
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, \(P(W \mid H)\) = 0.8.
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter, \(P(W \mid S)\) = 0.2.

We are asked to find the posterior probability \(P(H \mid W)\), where \(H\) is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \(W\) is the event "witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller".

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we compute \(P(H \mid W)\):

\[
P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
