To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \) : The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \) : The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We'll calculate each term as follows:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
    - \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly divided equally into two groups)
    - \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
    - \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone from the 185 cm or taller group. From the given information, this is 80% (or 0.8).
    - \( P(W|\neg T) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone from the shorter group as being 185 cm or taller. Thus, this is 20% (or 0.2).

3. **Total probability \( P(W) \):** This will be calculated using the law of total probability:
    \[
    P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
    \]
    \[
    P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
    \]

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

Thus,

\[ {probability: 0.8} \]
