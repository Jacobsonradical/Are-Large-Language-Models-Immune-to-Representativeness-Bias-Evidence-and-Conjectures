To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
1. The prior probability \( P(T) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.5 because the population is roughly equal in size.
2. The prior probability \( P(S) \) that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.5.
3. The likelihood \( P(W|T) \) that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually that height is 0.80.
4. The likelihood \( P(W|S) \) that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter is 0.20.
5. The probability of being an attacker given height, \( P(T|A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(S|A) = 0.85 \)

We are interested in the posterior probability \( P(T|W) \), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T|A)}{P(W|T) \cdot P(T|A) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S|A)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85}
\]

Simplify the terms in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17}
\]
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{\{probability: 0.4138\}}
\]
