To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \(H_A\): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_B\): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \(P(H_A | W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H_A | W) = \frac{P(W | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we identify each component of Bayes' theorem.

**Prior probabilities:**
- \(P(H_A)\): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from the provided information).
- \(P(H_B)\): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.

**Likelihoods:**
- \(P(W | H_A)\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller = 0.80.
- \(P(W | H_B)\): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.20.

**Total probability of the witness's identification \(P(W)\):**
\[ P(W) = P(W | H_A) \cdot P(H_A) + P(W | H_B) \cdot P(H_B) \]

Now we can plug in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we calculate \(P(H_A | W)\):
\[ P(H_A | W) = \frac{P(W | H_A) \cdot P(H_A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H_A | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
