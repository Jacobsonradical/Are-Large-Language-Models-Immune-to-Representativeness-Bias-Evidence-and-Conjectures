We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the prior information about attackers' heights.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We already know:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

Now, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \(0.41\).
