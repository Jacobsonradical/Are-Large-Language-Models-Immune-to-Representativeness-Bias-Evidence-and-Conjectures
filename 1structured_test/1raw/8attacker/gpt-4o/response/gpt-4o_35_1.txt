To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Let's define the events:
    - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
    - \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. From the given information:
    - \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are 185 cm or taller).
    - \( P(W | B) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are shorter than 185 cm).

3. Prior probabilities:
    - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
    - \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

4. We want to find \( P(A | W) \) (The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating \( P(A | W) \):

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.414 \).
