To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayesian inference.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- The prior probability \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The probability \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- The probability \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (where \( A^c \) is the complement of \( A \), i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time).

Next, we need to compute \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \)

So:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, in the required format:
{probability: 0.4138}
