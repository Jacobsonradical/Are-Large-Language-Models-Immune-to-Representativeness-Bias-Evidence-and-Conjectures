To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \(T\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
Let \(W\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \(P(T|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \(P(T)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W|T)\) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(W)\) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \(P(T) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075\) (since the population is split evenly, but only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.925\) (the probability that the attacker is under 185 cm).
- \(P(W|T) = 0.8\) (witness accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W|\neg T) = 0.2\) (witness error rate when the attacker is under 185 cm).

Next, we need the total probability \(P(W)\):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.075) + (0.2 \times 0.925) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.06 + 0.185 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.245 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.075}{0.245} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.06}{0.245} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.2449 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2449.
