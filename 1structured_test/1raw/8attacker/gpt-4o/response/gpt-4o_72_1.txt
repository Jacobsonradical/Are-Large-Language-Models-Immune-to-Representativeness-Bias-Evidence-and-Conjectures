To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is the step-by-step calculation:

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on attack statistics)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | L) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(H | W) \), the conditional probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | L) \cdot P(L)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.

{probability: 0.414}
