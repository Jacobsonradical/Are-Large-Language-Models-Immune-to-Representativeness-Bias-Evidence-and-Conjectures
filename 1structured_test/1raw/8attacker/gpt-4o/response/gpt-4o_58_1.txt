To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W_A \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- \( W_B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_A|A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_B|B) = 0.20 \) (witness erroneously identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(A|W) \), where \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Let's calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|W) \):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore,
\[ {probability: 0.4138} \]
