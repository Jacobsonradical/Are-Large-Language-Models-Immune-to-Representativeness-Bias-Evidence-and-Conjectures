To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the provided prior information.

Given:
1. The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm: \( P(\text{<185}) = 0.85 \)
2. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{≥185}) = 0.15 \)
3. The probability of the witness correctly identifying a height of 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{ID as ≥185}|\text{≥185}) = 0.80 \)
4. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller: \( P(\text{ID as ≥185}|\text{<185}) = 0.20 \)

To find the posterior probability \( P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) \), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) = \frac{P(\text{ID as ≥185}|\text{≥185}) \cdot P(\text{≥185})}{P(\text{ID as ≥185})} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(\text{ID as ≥185}) \):

\[ P(\text{ID as ≥185}) = P(\text{ID as ≥185}|\text{≥185}) \cdot P(\text{≥185}) + P(\text{ID as ≥185}|\text{<185}) \cdot P(\text{<185}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{ID as ≥185}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{ID as ≥185}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{ID as ≥185}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) \):

\[ P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{≥185}|\text{ID as ≥185}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
