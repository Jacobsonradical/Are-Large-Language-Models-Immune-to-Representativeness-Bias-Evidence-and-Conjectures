To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the relevant probabilities:

- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller because the population is roughly equal in size)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \) (the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (the witness's accuracy in identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | B) = 0.2 \) (the witness's error rate in identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (the conditional probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller out of all attackers)
- \( P(B | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (the conditional probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm out of all attackers)

To find \( P(A | W) \), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such, using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A | W) \):

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
