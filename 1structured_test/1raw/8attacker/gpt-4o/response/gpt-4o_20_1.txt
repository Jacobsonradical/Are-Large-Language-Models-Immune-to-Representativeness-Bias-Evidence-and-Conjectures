To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
  
From the information given:
1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately:

\{probability: 0.41\}
