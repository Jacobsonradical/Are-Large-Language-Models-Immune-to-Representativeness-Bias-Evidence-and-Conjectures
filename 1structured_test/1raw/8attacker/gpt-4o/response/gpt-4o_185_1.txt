To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

Let's define:
- \(A\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B) = 0.85\) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(W|A) = 0.80\) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W|B) = 0.20\) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \(P(A|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \(P(W)\) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \(P(A|W)\):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \(0.4138\).
