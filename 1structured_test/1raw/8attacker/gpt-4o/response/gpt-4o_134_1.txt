To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information, we'll need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(Taller) = P(Attacker's height \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(Shorter) = P(Attacker's height < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - Given that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability the witness correctly identifies them as taller is \( P(\text{Identified as Taller} \mid Taller) = 0.8 \)
   - Given that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability the witness incorrectly identifies them as taller is \( P(\text{Identified as Taller} \mid Shorter) = 0.2 \)

3. **Prior Attack Rates:**
   - \( P(\text{Attack given Shorter}) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(\text{Attack given Taller}) = 0.15 \)

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. This is formulated as:
\[ P(Taller \mid \text{Identified as Taller}) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Taller \mid \text{Identified as Taller}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Taller} \mid Taller) \cdot P(Taller)}{P(\text{Identified as Taller})} \]

First, calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller \( P(\text{Identified as Taller}) \):
\[ P(\text{Identified as Taller}) = P(\text{Identified as Taller} \mid Taller) \cdot P(Taller) + P(\text{Identified as Taller} \mid Shorter) \cdot P(Shorter) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Taller}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Taller}) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Taller \mid \text{Identified as Taller}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(Taller \mid \text{Identified as Taller}) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(Taller \mid \text{Identified as Taller}) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
