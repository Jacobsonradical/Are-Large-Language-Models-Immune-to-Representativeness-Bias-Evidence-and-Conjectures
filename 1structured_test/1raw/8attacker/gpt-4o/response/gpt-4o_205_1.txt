To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

We'll break down the information as follows:

1. **Prior Probability (P(Height ≥ 185 cm))**:
   - Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is \( P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 \).
   
2. **Likelihood**:
   - The witness correctly identified a person as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also made errors 20% of the time.
   - \( P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 \)
     
3. **Base Rate of Attackers**:
   - Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:
     - \( P(Attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.85 \)
     - \( P(Attacker is ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 \)

We're interested in finding the posterior probability:
\[ P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) \]

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, calculate the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(B) \)):
\[ P(B) = P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) \cdot P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) \cdot P(Height < 185 cm) \]

Using the given information:
\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = \frac{P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) \cdot P(Height ≥ 185 cm)}{P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm)} \]
\[ P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 \]

This means that given the witness's statement and their accuracy, there is an 80% probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
