To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

Calculating \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|W) \):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{ probability: 0.4138 }
