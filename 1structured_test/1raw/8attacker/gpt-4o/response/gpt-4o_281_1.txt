To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification. We'll use the following notation:

- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \bar{T} \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We'll calculate \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the likelihood that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down each component:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(T) \) and \( P(\bar{T}) \)**:
   According to the problem, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
   \[ P(T) = 0.15 \]
   \[ P(\bar{T}) = 0.85 \]

2. **Likelihood \( P(W|T) \) and \( P(W|\bar{T}) \)**:
   The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
   \[ P(W|T) = 0.80 \]
   \( P(W|\bar{T}) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% (the error rate):
   \[ P(W|\bar{T}) = 0.20 \]

3. **Total Probability \( P(W) \)**:
   \[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\bar{T}) \cdot P(\bar{T}) \]
   \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
