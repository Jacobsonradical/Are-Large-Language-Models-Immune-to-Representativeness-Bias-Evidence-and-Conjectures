To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events and probabilities:

- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( V \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
 
From the information given, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people taller and shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal).
- \( P(V) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | V) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time).

We want to find \( P(T | W) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We first need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | V) \cdot P(V) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Therefore, the answer is: 
{probability: 0.8}
