To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the following terms:
- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H' \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's determine the values for these probabilities:
- From the information, we have \( P(E|H) = 0.80 \). The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
- The prior probability \( P(H) \) that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The prior probability \( P(H') \) that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or \( P(H') = 0.85 \).

Next, let's calculate \( P(E|H') \):
- \( P(E|H') = 0.20 \). The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time.

Now, we calculate the total probability \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H') \cdot P(H') \]

Substitute the values we have:
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
