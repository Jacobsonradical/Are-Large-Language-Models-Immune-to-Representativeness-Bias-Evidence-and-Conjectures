To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can structure the problem:

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) be the event that the attacker is identified as 185 cm or taller by the witness.

We are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W|T^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

First, we need to compute the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Substituting in the given values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Substituting in the values:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
