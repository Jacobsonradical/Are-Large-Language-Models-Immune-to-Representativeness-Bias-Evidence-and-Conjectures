To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our belief about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time: \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \)
- The witness errs 20% of the time, so \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \)
- The population distribution implies \( P(A) = 0.5 \) and \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)
- Among attackers, 85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller: \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) and \( P(A) = 0.15 \)

Note that we're dealing with the base rates applied to attackers. This information will be consolidated into our calculations.

First, calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
