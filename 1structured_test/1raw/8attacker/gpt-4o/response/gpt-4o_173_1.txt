To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem provides a way to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as new evidence is presented. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (the accuracy of the witness).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given data:
- The accuracy of the witness: \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
- The error of the witness: \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (where \( \neg A \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.414. Hence:
