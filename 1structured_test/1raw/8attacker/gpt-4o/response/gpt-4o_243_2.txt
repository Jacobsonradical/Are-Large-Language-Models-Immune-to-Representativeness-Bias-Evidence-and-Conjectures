To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \geq 185 \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H < 185 \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( ID \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H \geq 185 | ID) \).

From the information given:
- The court assessed that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller, and also errs in 20% of the cases.
- The population split is roughly equal; hence, \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.5 \) and \( P(H < 185) = 0.5 \).
- The attacker distribution gives \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \) and \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) among attackers. Note that this distribution must be considered as prior probabilities \( P(H < 185)_{\text{attacker}} \) and \( P(H \geq 185)_{\text{attacker}} \).

1. The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(ID | H \geq 185) = 0.80
   \]

2. The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(ID | H < 185) = 0.20
   \]

3. Prior probabilities:
   \[
   P(H \geq 185)_{\text{attacker}} = 0.15, \quad P(H < 185)_{\text{attacker}} = 0.85
   \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H \geq 185 | ID) = \frac{P(ID | H \geq 185) P(H \geq 185)_{\text{attacker}}}{P(ID | H \geq 185) P(H \geq 185)_{\text{attacker}} + P(ID | H < 185) P(H < 185)_{\text{attacker}}}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(H \geq 185 | ID) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85}
\]

Calculating the numerator:
\[
0.80 \times 0.15 = 0.12
\]

Calculating the denominator:
\[
0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(H \geq 185 | ID) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
