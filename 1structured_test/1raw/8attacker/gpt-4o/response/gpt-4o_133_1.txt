We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( T \): the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
  
We're given:
- \( P(T) = 0.50 \) (because the population of shorter and taller people is roughly equal)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.50 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is tall given that the witness identified them as tall.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we compute \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.50) + (0.20 \cdot 0.50) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.50}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.80 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
