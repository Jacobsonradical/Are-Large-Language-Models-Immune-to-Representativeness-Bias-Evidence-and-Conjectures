To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker)
   - \( P(W|L) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall)

3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|L) \cdot P(L)} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[ \text{Numerator} = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ \text{Denominator} = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, calculate the probability:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
