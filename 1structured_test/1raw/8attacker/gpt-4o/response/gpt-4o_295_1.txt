To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \(T\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \(W\) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(W | T) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W | T^c) = 0.20\) where \(T^c\) is the complement of \(T\).
- \(P(T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(T^c) = 0.85\)

We need to find the posterior probability \(P(T | W)\).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \(P(W)\):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T)P(T) + P(W | T^c)P(T^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \(P(T | W)\):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.414.
