To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to determine \( P(A|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the given information:

1. The general population is split equally between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller:
   - \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.5 \)

2. For attackers:
   - \( P(B|attacker) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(A|attacker) = 0.15 \)

3. Witness's accuracy:
   - \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(W|B) = 0.2 \)

We seek \( P(A|W) \). By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|W) \):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
