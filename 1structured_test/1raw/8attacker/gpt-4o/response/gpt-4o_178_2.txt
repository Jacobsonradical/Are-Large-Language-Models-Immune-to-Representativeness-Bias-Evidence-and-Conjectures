Based on the information given, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Here's the process broken down step-by-step:

1. Let's define the events:
    - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
    - \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
    - \( P(T) = P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
    - \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller).
    - \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm).
    - \( P(\neg T | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
    - \( P(T | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).

3. Compute the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T)P(T) + P(W | \neg T)P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
