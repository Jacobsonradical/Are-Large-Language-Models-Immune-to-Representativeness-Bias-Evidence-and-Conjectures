To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem states:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Breaking down each term:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: This is the initial probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From info (b):
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H') = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihood \( P(E | H) \)**: This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From info (a):
   - \( P(E | H) = 0.80 \)

3. **Normalizing Constant \( P(E) \)**: This is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | H') \cdot P(H')
   \]
   - \( P(E | H') \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which from info (a) is \( 0.20 \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Posterior Probability \( P(H | E) \)**: Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find the probability:
   \[
   P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.414 (or roughly 41.4%).
