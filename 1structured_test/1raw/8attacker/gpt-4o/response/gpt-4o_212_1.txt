To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the breakdown of the given information and the steps to calculate this probability:

### Given Information
1. **Prior Probability (Without Witness Information)**
   - \(P(A) = 0.5\) (Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
   - \(P(\neg A) = 0.5\) (Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Conditional Probabilities**
   - Reliability of the witness:
     - \(P(W|A) = 0.8\) (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
     - \(P(W|\neg A) = 0.2\) (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
   - Rate of attackers:
     - \(P(A|E) = 0.15\) (Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker profile)
     - \(P(\neg A|E) = 0.85\) (Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm given the attacker profile)

3. **Objective**
   - Estimate \(P(A | W \& E)\): Probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the attacker profile.

### Calculation Steps
1. **Estimate the Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \(P(W)\) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]

First, calculate the unconditional probability \(P(W)\):

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = 0.8
\]

2. **Combine with Attack Profile \(P(A|E)\) Using Bayes' Theorem Again:**

We use the previous estimate as the new evidence:

\[
P(A | W \& E) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A|E)}{P(W)}
\]

Assume for simplicity the witness reliability and attacker profile are uncorrelated, and the probability \(P(W)\) is already obtained with \(P(E)\):

Estimate \(P(A|E,W)\) using:

\[
P(A|W,E) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A|E)}{P(W)}
\]

Approximately:

\[
P(A|W,E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{P(W)} 
\]

Given previously estimated \(P(W) = 0.5\):

\[
P(A|W,E) \approx \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.5} = \frac{0.12}{0.5} \approx 0.24
\]

However, combining via associative previous, a broader baseline for \(P(A)\), standard case.

Thus, more simply,

\(\boxed{0.8}\)

### Final Answer

{probability: 0.38}
