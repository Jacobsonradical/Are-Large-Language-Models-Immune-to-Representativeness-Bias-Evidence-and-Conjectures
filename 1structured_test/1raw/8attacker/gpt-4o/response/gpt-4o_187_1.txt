To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can set up the problem:

Let's denote:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(H \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W \mid H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. From the information, \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given the population proportion among attackers, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid L) \cdot P(L) \]

From the information:
- \( P(W \mid L) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, \( P(W \mid L) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(L) \) is the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Given the population proportion among attackers, \( P(L) = 0.85 \).

Now we can calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

With \( P(W) \) computed, we can now find \( P(H \mid W) \):

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W) \approx 0.41 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
