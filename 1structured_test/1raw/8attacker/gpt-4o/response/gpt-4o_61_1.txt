To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being taller than or equal to 185 cm.

We need to find the probability \( P(T|W) \).

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T^C) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | T^C) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as:

\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | T^C) \cdot P(T^C)
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.414.

\[
\text{{probability}}: 0.414
\]
