To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \(T\) = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) = The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \(P(T|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to determine each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(W|T) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From the problem, this probability is 0.80 (80%).

2. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the problem, this is 0.15 (15%) because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

3. \( P(W) \): The overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Where \(T^c\) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

- \( P(W|T^c) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From the problem, since the witness errs 20% of the time (when they are shorter), this is 0.20 (20%).
- \( P(T^c) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the problem, this is 0.85 (85%) because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm. 

So, 

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
