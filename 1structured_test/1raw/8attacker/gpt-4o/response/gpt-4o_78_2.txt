To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's report, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given in the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, because the population is evenly split).
- \( P(H') = 0.5 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We are given the following probabilities about the witness's accuracy:
- \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(E|H') = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

To apply Bayes' Theorem, we first need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H') \cdot P(H') \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H|E) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
