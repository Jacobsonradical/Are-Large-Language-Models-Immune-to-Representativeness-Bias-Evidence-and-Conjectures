To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the base rates of attackers' heights, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context can be expressed as follows:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified Tall})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \) is the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's identification.
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker.
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \) is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall}) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall.

To find \( P(\text{Identified Tall}) \), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness could identify someone as tall:

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Identified Tall} | \text{Short}) = 0.20 \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall.
- \( P(\text{Short}) = 0.85 \) is the base rate of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm.

Thus, we have:

\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \):

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified Tall}) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore:

{probability: 0.41}
