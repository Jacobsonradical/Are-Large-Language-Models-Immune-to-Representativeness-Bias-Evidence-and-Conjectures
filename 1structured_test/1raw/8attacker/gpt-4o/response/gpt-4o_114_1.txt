To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

Given:
- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 15\% = 0.15 \) (prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) = 85\% = 0.85 \) (prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(\text{Identified as taller} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) = 80\% = 0.8 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{Identified as taller} | \text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) = 20\% = 0.2 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as taller)

We need to find:
- \( P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} | \text{Identified as taller}) \) (the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as taller).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} | \text{Identified as taller}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as taller} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm})}{P(\text{Identified as taller})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{Identified as taller}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Identified as taller}) = P(\text{Identified as taller} | \text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm}) + P(\text{Identified as taller} | \text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) \cdot P(\text{Height} < 185 \, \text{cm}) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as taller}) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as taller}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as taller}) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} | \text{Identified as taller}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} | \text{Identified as taller}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Height} \geq 185 \, \text{cm} | \text{Identified as taller}) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.414.
