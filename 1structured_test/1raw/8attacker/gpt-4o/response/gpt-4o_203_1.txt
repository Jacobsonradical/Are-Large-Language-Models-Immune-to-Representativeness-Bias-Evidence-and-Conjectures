We can approach this problem using Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (population is roughly equally divided in height)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg T \mid \text{attack}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(T \mid \text{attack}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies the height if 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness correctly identifies the height if shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[
P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.41 \).

Final answer:

{probability: 0.41}
