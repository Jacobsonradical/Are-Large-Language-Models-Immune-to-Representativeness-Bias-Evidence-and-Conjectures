To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here's the setup with the given information:

1. \( P(H \geq 185) \): Prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(H < 185) \): Prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W \,|\, H \geq 185) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W \,|\, H < 185) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
5. \( P(A \,|\, H \geq 185) \): Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
6. \( P(A \,|\, H < 185) \): Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- The court assessed the witness's ability: 
  - \( P(W \,|\, H \geq 185) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W \,|\, H < 185) = 0.2 \)
- Population distribution is roughly equal:
  - \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(H < 185) = 0.5 \)
- Attackers' height distribution:
  - \( P(A \,|\, H < 185) = 0.85 \)
  - \( P(A \,|\, H \geq 185) = 0.15 \)

We want to compute the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, \( P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) = \frac{P(W \,|\, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W \,|\, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W \,|\, H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

So,
\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) = \frac{P(W \,|\, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
