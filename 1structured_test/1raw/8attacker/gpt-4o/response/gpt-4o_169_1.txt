Let's analyze the available information using Bayes' Theorem.

We'll define the following:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker’s height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We'll calculate the probability \( P(H_1 | W) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
1. \( P(W | H_1) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
2. \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given as 15% or 0.15.
3. \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We also need to consider the situation if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(W | H_2) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20% or 0.2.
- \( P(H_2) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given as 85% or 0.85.

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | W) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Hence:
\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
