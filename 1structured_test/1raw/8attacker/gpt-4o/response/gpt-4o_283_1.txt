To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem connects prior knowledge with new evidence to update the probability of an event.

Given:
- Prior probability \( P(Taller) = 0.5 \)
- Prior probability \( P(Shorter) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(Attack|Shorter) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(Attack|Taller) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(Witness\ correct|Taller) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(Witness\ correct|Shorter) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(Witness\ incorrect|Taller) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(Witness\ incorrect|Shorter) = 0.2 \)

First, we need to calculate \( P(Witness\ says\ Taller) \), which can be done by summing the probabilities of the witness saying "Taller" given the attacker is actually taller and the attacker is actually shorter.
\[ P(Witness\ says\ Taller) = P(Witness\ says\ Taller | Taller) \cdot P(Taller) + P(Witness\ says\ Taller | Shorter) \cdot P(Shorter) \]

\[ P(Witness\ says\ Taller) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(Taller | Witness\ says\ Taller) \):

\[ P(Taller | Witness\ says\ Taller) = \frac{P(Witness\ says\ Taller | Taller) \cdot P(Taller)}{P(Witness\ says\ Taller)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(Taller | Witness\ says\ Taller) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

Therefore, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
