To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given the information, we need to find \( P( \text{Height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid \text{Witness identified height as} \geq 185 \text{ cm} ) \).

Here's the process step-by-step:

1. Define events:
   - \( H \geq 185 \text{ cm} \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W \): The witness identified the height as 185 cm or taller.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(W \mid H \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W \mid H < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \) (witness mistakenly identifies height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter)
   - \( P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.15 \) (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.85 \) (proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm)

3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm})}{P(W)}
\]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W \mid H \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm}) + P(W \mid H < 185 \text{ cm}) \cdot P(H < 185 \text{ cm})
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

Calculate \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substitute \( P(W) \) back into Bayes' formula:

\[
P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

Calculate the final probability:

\[
P(H \geq 185 \text{ cm} \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
