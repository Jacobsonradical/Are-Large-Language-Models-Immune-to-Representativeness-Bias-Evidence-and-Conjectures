To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information:

- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (Half of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (Half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(\neg T | \text{attack}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(T | \text{attack}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to find the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (\( P(W) \)):

\[
P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T | \text{attack}) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T | \text{attack})
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Next, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T | \text{attack})}{P(W)}
\]
\[
P(T | W) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T | W) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
