To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll define:

- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E\): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \(P(H_1 | E)\) â€” the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H_1)\): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E | H_1)\): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(H_2) = 0.85\) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(E | H_1) = 0.80\) (80% correct identification rate if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(E | H_2) = 0.20\) (20% incorrect identification rate if the attacker is shorter).

First, compute \(P(E)\) (the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability} : 0.414 \} \]
