To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witness's identification.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = 15% or 0.15 (Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller based on general population)
- \( P(\neg H) \) = 85% or 0.85 (Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E|H) \) = 80% or 0.80 (Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) = 20% or 0.20 (Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
