To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem in this context is:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(H\) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\lnot H)\): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E \mid H)\): The probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E \mid \lnot H)\): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\lnot H) = 0.85\) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(E \mid H) = 0.80\) (witness correctly identifies a tall attacker 80% of the time)
- \(P(E \mid \lnot H) = 0.20\) (witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall 20% of the time)

We need to find \(P(E)\):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \lnot H) \cdot P(\lnot H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \(P(H \mid E)\):
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
