To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W | B) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

We need to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.414 \).
