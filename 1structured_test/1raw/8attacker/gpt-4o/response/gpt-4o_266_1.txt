Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T^c \): the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, the formula for conditional probability is:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's identify the components we need:

- \( P(T) \): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so that leaves 15% being 185 cm or taller:
  \[
  P(T) = 0.15
  \]

- \( P(W | T) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as:
  \[
  P(W | T) = 0.80
  \]

- \( P(W | T^c) \): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20%:
  \[
  P(W | T^c) = 0.20
  \]

- \( P(T^c) \): the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
  \[
  P(T^c) = 0.85
  \]

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) 
      = 0.12 + 0.17 
      = 0.29
\]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[
P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
         = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
         = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
         \approx 0.41
\]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[
\{ "probability": 0.41 \}
\]
