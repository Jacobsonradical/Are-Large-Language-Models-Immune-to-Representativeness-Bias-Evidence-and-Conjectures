To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(T|attacker) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T|attacker) = 0.85 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
