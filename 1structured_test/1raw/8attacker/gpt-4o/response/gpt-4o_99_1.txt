To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the relevant probabilities:

- Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let "S" be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let "W" be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We're given:
- P(T) = 0.5  (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
- P(S) = 0.5  (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
- P(W | T) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- P(W | S) = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

We need to find P(T | W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.50) + (0.20 \cdot 0.50) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.40 + 0.10 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.50 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.50}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.40}{0.50} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.80 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.80.
