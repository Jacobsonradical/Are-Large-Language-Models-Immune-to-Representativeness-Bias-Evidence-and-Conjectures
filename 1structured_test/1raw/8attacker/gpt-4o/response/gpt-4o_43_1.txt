To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and the evidence is the witness identification.

Given information:
1. \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Attacker}) = 0.15 \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller given an attack)
2. \( P(\text{Short} | \text{Attacker}) = 0.85 \) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm given an attack)
3. \( P(\text{Correctly Identifies Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \)
4. \( P(\text{Incorrectly Identifies Tall} | \text{Short}) = 0.20 \)

We aim to find the updated probability, \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) \).

First, by Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified as Tall})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \) based on prior probability before identification
- \( P(\text{Identified as Tall}) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall.

To find \( P(\text{Identified as Tall}) \):
\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, plugging back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
