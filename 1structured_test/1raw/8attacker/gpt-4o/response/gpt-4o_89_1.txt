In order to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define our events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:

- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the overall population probability and given as 0.5.
- \( P(A^c) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, also 0.5.
- \( P(B | A) \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given in the conditions similar to that night, which is 0.8.
- \( P(B | A^c) \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter, which is 0.2.

Thus, we need to find \( P(A | B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A^c) \cdot P(A^c)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]

\[ P(A | B) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
