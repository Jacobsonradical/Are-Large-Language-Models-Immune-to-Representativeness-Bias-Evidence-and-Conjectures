To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information we have, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{12}{29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
