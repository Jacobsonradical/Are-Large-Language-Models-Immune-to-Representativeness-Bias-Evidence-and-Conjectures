To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( T \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equally split by height).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (since it's the complement of \( T \)).
- \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall person 80% of the time).
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies short person as tall 20% of the time).

We need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T | W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
