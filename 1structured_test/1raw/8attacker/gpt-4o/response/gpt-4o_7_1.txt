To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the relevant variables:

- \( H \) = height of the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) = height of the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) = witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H | W) \):
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]
