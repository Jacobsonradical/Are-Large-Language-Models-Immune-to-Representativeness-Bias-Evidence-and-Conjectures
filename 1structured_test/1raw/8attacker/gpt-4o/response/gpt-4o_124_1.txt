To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given data, we know:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(T') = 0.5 \)
- \( P(T|A) = 0.15 \) where \( A \) is the event that a person attacked.
- \( P(T'|A) = 0.85 \)
- The witness's accuracy when identifying height:
    - \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(W|T') = 0.2 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|T') \cdot P(T')} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
