To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the known probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's determine these probabilities:
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) since the witness is 80% accurate when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) from the given information that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) since the witness has a 20% error rate (identifying someone incorrectly as being 185 cm or taller when they are not).

Now we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be done using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]

So the final formatted answer is: {probability: 0.414}
