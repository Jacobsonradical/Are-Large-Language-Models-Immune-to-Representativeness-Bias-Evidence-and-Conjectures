To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker of 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- \( P(E|\neg H) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, this is \( 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 \).
- \( P(\neg H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

We first need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H|E) \):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
