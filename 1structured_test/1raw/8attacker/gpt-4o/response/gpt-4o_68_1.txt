We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. Let's define our events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \). Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's break down each term:

1. Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(T) \)): According to information "a", the population is equally split, but 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
   \[ P(T) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \]
   \[ P(\neg T) = 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.425 \]

2. Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (\( P(W|T) \)): According to information "b", this is 80%.
   \[ P(W|T) = 0.80 \]

3. Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(W|\neg T) \)): This corresponds to the error rate, which is 20%.
   \[ P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.075) + (0.20 \cdot 0.425) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.060 + 0.085 = 0.145 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.075}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.060}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
