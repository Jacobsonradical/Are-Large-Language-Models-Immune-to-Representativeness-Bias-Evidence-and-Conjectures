To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said they were.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness identifies someone 185 cm or taller correctly.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)

We also need to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]

Where \( A^c \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \)

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
