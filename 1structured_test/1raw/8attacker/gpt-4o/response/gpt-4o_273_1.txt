To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can break down the information:

1. **Prior Probability**:
   - The probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 0.5.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

2. **Likelihood**:
   - The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they actually are 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
   - The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2.

3. **Posterior Probability**:
   - We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification using Bayes' Theorem.

Let's use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{Identified as Tall})} \]

Where \( P(\text{Identified as Tall}) \) can be found as:

\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Not Tall}) \]

Plugging in the numbers:

- \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Not Tall}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Identified as Tall} | \text{Not Tall}) = 0.2 \)

\[ P(\text{Identified as Tall}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can find the posterior probability:

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{Identified as Tall}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
