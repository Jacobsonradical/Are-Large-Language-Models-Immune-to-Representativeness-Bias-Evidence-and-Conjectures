To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the problem, we should use Bayes' theorem. Here's how to structure the calculation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   
2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) \): Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability). From "a", we know the population percentages, but we need attacker-specific probabilities:
     - \( P(T) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \)
     - \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.425 \)
   - \( P(W | T) \): Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller. From "b", \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W | \neg T) \): Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From "b", \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
   
3. **Calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \):**
   \[ P(W) = P(W | T)P(T) + P(W | \neg T)P(\neg T) \]
   \[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.075) + (0.20 \times 0.425) \]
   \[ P(W) = 0.060 + 0.085 = 0.145 \]

4. **Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):**
   \[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T)P(T)}{P(W)} \]
   \[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.075}{0.145} \]
   \[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.060}{0.145} \]
   \[ P(T | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
