To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities.

Given:
- Prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller (\( P(T) \)): 0.15
- Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm (\( P(\neg T) \)): 0.85
- Probability of witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller (\( P(W | T) \)): 0.80
- Probability of witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm (\( P(W | \neg T) \)): 0.20

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (\( P(T | W) \)).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{12}{29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ { "probability": 0.4138 } \]
