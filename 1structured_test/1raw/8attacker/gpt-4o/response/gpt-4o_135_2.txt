To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

Given information:
- Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(T) \) is 0.15.
- Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( P(S) \) is 0.85.
- The witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (sensitivity) is 80% \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \).
- The witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (false positive) is 20% \( P(W|S) = 0.20 \).

We want to find \( P(T|W) \).

Bayes' theorem formula:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \times P(T) + P(W|S) \times P(S) \]

Let's compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \times P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
