To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
