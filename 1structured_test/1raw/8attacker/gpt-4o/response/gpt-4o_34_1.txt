To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the relevant probabilities:
- \( P(T_1) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T_2) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|T_1) \): Probability that the witness correctly identified an attacker 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|T_2) \): Probability that the witness erred and identified an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \): Overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \( P(T_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T_2) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E|T_1) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height in 80% of cases)
- \( P(E|T_2) = 0.20 \) (witness errs in 20% of cases)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T_1|E) = \frac{P(E|T_1) P(T_1)}{P(E)}
\]

\( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller and can be computed as:

\[
P(E) = P(E|T_1) P(T_1) + P(E|T_2) P(T_2)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

So,

\[
P(T_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.4138 \).

\[
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
