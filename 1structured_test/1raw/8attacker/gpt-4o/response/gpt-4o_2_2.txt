To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to find the probability \( P(\text{tall} | \text{witness identified tall}) \).

First, let's define some terms:
- \( T \): The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller)
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W_T \): The witness identifies the attacker as tall
- \( W_S \): The witness identifies the attacker as short

From the information provided:

1. P(W_T|T) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
2. P(W_T|S) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
3. P(T) = 0.15 (The prior probability that an attacker is tall)
4. P(S) = 0.85 (The prior probability that an attacker is short)

We are looking for \( P(T | W_T) \), the probability that the attacker is tall, given that the witness identified them as tall.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{ P(W_T | T) \cdot P(T) }{ P(W_T) } \]

Where \( P(W_T) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall, regardless of whether they are actually tall or short. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_T) = P(W_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_T | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_T) = (0.80) \cdot (0.15) + (0.20) \cdot (0.85) \]
\[ P(W_T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_T) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{ (0.80) \cdot (0.15) }{ 0.29 } \]
\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{ 0.12 }{ 0.29 } \]
\[ P(T | W_T) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as tall, is approximately \( 0.41 \).
