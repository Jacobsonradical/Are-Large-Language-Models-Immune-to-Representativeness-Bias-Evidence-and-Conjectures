To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given:

1. Probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(S)): 0.5
2. Probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(T)): 0.5
3. Probability that an attacker shorter than 185 cm committed the crime (P(A|S)): 0.85
4. Probability that an attacker 185 cm or taller committed the crime (P(A|T)): 0.15
5. Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm (P(W|S)): 0.8
6. Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller (P(W|T)): 0.8
7. Probability that the witness misidentifies a person (i.e., says taller when shorter or vice versa) (P(W|not S) and P(W|not T)): 0.2

We are interested in calculating P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be broken down using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Plugging in the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified them as such, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
