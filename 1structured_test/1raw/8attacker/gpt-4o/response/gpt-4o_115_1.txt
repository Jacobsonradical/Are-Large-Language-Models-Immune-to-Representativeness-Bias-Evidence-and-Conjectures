To estimate the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification and the statistics provided, we will use Bayes' theorem. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - \( P(H_t) \): Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - \( P(H_s) \): Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

    From the given information:
    \[
    P(H_t) = 0.15 \quad \text{and} \quad P(H_s) = 0.85
    \]

2. **Likelihood**:
    - \( P(W | H_t) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - \( P(W | H_s) \): Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

    From the given information:
    \[
    P(W | H_t) = 0.80 \quad \text{and} \quad P(W | H_s) = 0.20
    \]

3. **Posterior probability** (what we want to find):
    - \( P(H_t | W) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
    
    By Bayes' theorem:
    \[
    P(H_t | W) = \frac{P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W)}
    \]

    Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller:
    \[
    P(W) = P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W | H_s) \cdot P(H_s)
    \]
    \[
    P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
    \]
    \[
    P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
    \]
    \[
    P(W) = 0.29
    \]

4. **Calculating \( P(H_t | W) \) using the values we found**:
    \[
    P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
    \]
    \[
    P(H_t | W) \approx 0.4138
    \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
