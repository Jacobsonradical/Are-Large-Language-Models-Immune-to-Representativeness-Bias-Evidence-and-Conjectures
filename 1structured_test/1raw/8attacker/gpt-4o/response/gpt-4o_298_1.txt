To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the problem statement, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (equal population assumption)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (equal population assumption)
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

We also know:
- \( P(\neg T) \) (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
- \( P(T) \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Let's calculate \( P(T \mid W) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identification is approximately 0.414.

Please confirm if any specific details or assumptions need to be adjusted.
