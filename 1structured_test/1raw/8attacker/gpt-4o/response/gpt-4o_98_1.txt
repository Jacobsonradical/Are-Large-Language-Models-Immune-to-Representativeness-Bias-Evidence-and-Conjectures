To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( H_1 \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): Attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

The given information can be translated into probabilities:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being less than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller attacker).
- \( P(W|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

We want to find \( P(H_1|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)}
\]

To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W) = P(W|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H_1|W) \):

\[
P(H_1|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41379 (which can be rounded to 0.414 for simplicity).

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
