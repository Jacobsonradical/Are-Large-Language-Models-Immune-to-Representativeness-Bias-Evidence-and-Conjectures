To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

### Given Information:
1. \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (The population split is equal between those shorter and those 185 cm or taller.)
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (The witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.)
4. \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \) (The witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is under 185 cm.)
5. \( P(T| \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.)
6. \( P(\neg T| \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm.)

First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities adjusted for the fact that the attack was perpetrated by an attacker:

\[
P(T) = P(T| \text{attacker}) = 0.15
\]
\[
P(\neg T) = P(\neg T| \text{attacker}) = 0.85
\]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \}
\]
