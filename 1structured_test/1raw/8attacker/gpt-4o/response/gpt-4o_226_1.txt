The estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.5.
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.5.
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are, is 0.8.
- \( P(B \mid \neg A) \), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not, is 0.2.

We want to find \( P(A \mid B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A \mid B) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
