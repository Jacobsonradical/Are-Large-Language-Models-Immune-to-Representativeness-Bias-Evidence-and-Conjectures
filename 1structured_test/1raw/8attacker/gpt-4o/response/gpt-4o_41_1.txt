To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the base rate information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \(T\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W\) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \(P(T \mid W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We already have these values:
- \(P(T) = 0.5\) (since the population is equally split between those shorter and those 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W \mid T) = 0.8\) (witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- \(P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.2\) (witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

To find \(P(W)\):
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

So:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
