To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
   - Let \( B \) be the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm".
   - Let \( W \) be the event "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller".

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W|B) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

3. **Calculate the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:**
   \[
   P(W) = P(W|A) \times P(A) + P(W|B) \times P(B)
   \]
   Substituting the given probabilities:
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(W) = 0.29
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|W) \):**
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \times P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|W) \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
