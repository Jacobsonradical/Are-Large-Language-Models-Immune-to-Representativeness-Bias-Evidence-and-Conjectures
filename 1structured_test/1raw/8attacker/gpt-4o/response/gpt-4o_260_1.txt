To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \)

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]

\[ P(A | B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \text{probability: 0.8} \]
