To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are looking to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to determine each component:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(B) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the provided information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (since the witness correctly identifies 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller).

To find \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
where:
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \) (since the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can plug in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
