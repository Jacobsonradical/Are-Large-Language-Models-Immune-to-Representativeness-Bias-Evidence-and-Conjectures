To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence (the witness's identification).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's define the terms:

- Prior probability \( P(H) \):
  - \( P(\text{185 cm or taller}) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(\text{shorter than 185 cm}) = 0.85 \)

- Likelihood \( P(E | H) \):
  - The witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time and errors 20% of the time.
  - \( P(\text{Witness says 185+ cm} | \text{Attacker is 185+ cm}) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(\text{Witness says 185+ cm} | \text{Attacker is <185 cm}) = 0.20 \)

Now, let's calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Where \( \neg H \) is the complement of \( H \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):

\[ P(E) = P(\text{Witness says 185+ cm} | \text{185+ cm}) \cdot P(\text{185+ cm}) + P(\text{Witness says 185+ cm} | \text{<185 cm}) \cdot P(\text{<185 cm}) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(\text{185+ cm} | \text{Witness says 185+ cm}) \):

\[ P(\text{185+ cm} | \text{Witness says 185+ cm}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness says 185+ cm} | \text{185+ cm}) \cdot P(\text{185+ cm})}{P(E)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(\text{185+ cm} | \text{Witness says 185+ cm}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{185+ cm} | \text{Witness says 185+ cm}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{185+ cm} | \text{Witness says 185+ cm}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Thus, the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
