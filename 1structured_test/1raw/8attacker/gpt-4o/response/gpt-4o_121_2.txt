To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define some terms:
- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_{H} \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_{L} \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H | W_{H}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W_{H}) = \frac{P(W_{H} | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_{H})} \]

We need to calculate the components of this equation:

1. **Prior probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.5 \) (since the population is roughly equal in size)
   - \( P(L) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihood:**
   - \( P(W_{H} | H) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
   - \( P(W_{H} | L) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)

3. **Total probability \( P(W_{H}) \):**
   \[ P(W_{H}) = P(W_{H} | H) \times P(H) + P(W_{H} | L) \times P(L) \]
   \[ P(W_{H}) = 0.8 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 \]
   \[ P(W_{H}) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | W_{H}) \):

\[ P(H | W_{H}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W_{H}) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W_{H}) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is 0.8.
