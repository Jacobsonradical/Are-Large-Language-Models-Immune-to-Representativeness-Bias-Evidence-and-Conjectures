To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let \( B \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.20.

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(A|B) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug \( P(B) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
