To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we need to consider:

1. The prior probabilities of the attacker being under 185 cm (`P(A)` = 0.85) and being 185 cm or taller (`P(B)` = 0.15).
2. The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given the actual height.

### Definitions
- Let \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

### Given Data
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W | H) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies a taller attacker.
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as being taller.

### Calculation Using Bayes' Theorem
We need to find \( P(H | W) \):
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H)P(H)}{P(W)}
\]
Where \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W) = P(W | H)P(H) + P(W | \neg H)P( \neg H)
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = (0.12) + (0.17) = 0.29
\]
Then, calculate \( P(H | W) \):
\[
P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H)P(H)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

### Conclusion
The estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \}
