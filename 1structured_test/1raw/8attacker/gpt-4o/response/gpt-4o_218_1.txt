To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W) \):
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (rounded to three decimal places).

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
