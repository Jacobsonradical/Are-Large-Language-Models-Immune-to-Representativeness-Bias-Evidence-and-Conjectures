Here’s how this estimate is obtained using Bayes' Theorem:

1. **P(A185|W)** is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness’s identification.
2. **P(W|A185)** is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.8).
3. **P(A185)** is the overall probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
4. **P(W|A<185)** is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.2).
5. **P(A<185)** is the overall probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[P(A185|W) = \frac{P(W|A185) \cdot P(A185)}{P(W)}\]

Where:

\[P(W) = P(W|A185) \cdot P(A185) + P(W|A<185) \cdot P(A<185)\]

Now substitute the values:

\[P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85\]

\[P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17\]

\[P(W) = 0.29\]

So,

\[P(A185|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]

\[P(A185|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]

\[P(A185|W) \approx 0.414\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
