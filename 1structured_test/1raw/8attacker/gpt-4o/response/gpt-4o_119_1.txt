To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Here's how we can break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Probability an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (Probability an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability the witness correctly identifies a taller attacker)
   - \( P(W | B) = 0.20 \) (Probability the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as taller)

3. **Bayes' Theorem Formula:**
   \[
   P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
   \]
   
   To find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | B) \cdot P(B)
   \]
   
4. **Calculate \( P(W) \):**
   \[
   P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(A | W) \):**
   \[
   P(A | W) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
