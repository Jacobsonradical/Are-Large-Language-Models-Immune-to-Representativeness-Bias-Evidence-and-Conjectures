To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1|E) \) (the probability of \( H_1 \) given \( E \)).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

From the information provided:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.20 \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm.

Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Now calculate the numerator and denominator:
\[ 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.17 \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
