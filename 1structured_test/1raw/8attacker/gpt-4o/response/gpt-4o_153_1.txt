To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we need to use Bayes' Theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem step-by-step:

1. **Notation and Initial Information**:
	- Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
	- Let \( B \) represent the event that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
	- We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. **Given Information**:
	- \( P(A) = 0.15 \): Only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.
	- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \): 85% of such attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
	- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \): If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness correctly identifies them as such.
	- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.20 \): If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies them as being 185 cm or taller.

3. **Bayes' Theorem**:
	\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

	First, we need to find \( P(B) \).

	\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|A^c)P(A^c) \]

	Plug in the known values:

	\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
	\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
	\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \)**:

	\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]

	\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

	\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
