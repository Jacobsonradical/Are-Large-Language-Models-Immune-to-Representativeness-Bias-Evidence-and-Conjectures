To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence from the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H_1) \), is \( 0.15 \) (15%).
- The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(H_2) \), is \( 0.85 \) (85%).

The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller is \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \) (80%).
The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \) (20%).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence and can be calculated as:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

So:
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting all values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:
\[ \{ probability: 0.4138 \} \]

Expressed to two decimal places:
\[ \{ probability: 0.41 \} \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
