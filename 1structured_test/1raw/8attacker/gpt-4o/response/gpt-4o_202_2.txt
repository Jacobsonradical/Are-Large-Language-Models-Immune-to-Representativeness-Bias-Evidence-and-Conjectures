To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( H = \) Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- \( W = \) Witness identified attacker as 185 cm or taller

We need to find \( P(H | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Given:
- \( P(H) = \frac{1}{2} \) (since the population is equally split)
- \( P(\neg H) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( P(W | H) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter person as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(H \land A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H \land A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

First, calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W | H)P(H) + P(W | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times \frac{1}{2} + 0.2 \times \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{P(W | H)P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times \frac{1}{2}}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H | W) = 0.8 \]

However, we must also consider the additional information about attackers' height probability given in the problem. The relevant probabilities should account for the likelihood of an attacker being of a certain height based on the population data (attacking probabilities).

Let's define:
- \( P(H | A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H | A) = 0.85 \)

Now we adjust \( P(H) \) to take into account the attack data:
\[ P(H) = \frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.85} = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = \frac{0.85}{0.15 + 0.85} = 0.85 \]

So We have to recompute:

\[ P(W | H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(W | \neg H) = 0.2 \]

And the revised \( P(H) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | H)P(H) + P(W | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Finally, the adjusted conditional probability given Bayes Theorem:

\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W) \approx 0.414 (or 0.41) \]

Therefore:

{probability: 0.41}
