To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, defined as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (The prior probability that a randomly chosen individual is 185 cm or taller, as the population is equally divided between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We also need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

where \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \) (The prior probability that a randomly chosen individual is shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{(0.8) \cdot (0.5)}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
