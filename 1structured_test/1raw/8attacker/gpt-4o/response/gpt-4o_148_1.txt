To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states that:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the hypothesis \( H \) (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is true given the evidence \( E \) (the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \).
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence \( E \) occurring.

Given the information:
1. A witness correctly identifies people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: \( P(E|H) = 0.8 \).
2. A witness incorrectly identifies people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: \( P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
3. The prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15% (as only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller): \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
4. The prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm is 85%: \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

Now, we need to find \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|E) \):
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
