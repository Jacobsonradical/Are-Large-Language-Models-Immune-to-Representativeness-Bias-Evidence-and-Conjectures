To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W \): The witness does not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the information given:

1. The prior probability \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally divided).
2. The prior probability \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \).
3. The probability that a person under 185 cm is the attacker \( P(\neg T| \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) and conversely \( P(T| \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \).
4. The witness correctly identifies height with an 80% accuracy, so:
    - \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is given by:

\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Calculating \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W) = \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
