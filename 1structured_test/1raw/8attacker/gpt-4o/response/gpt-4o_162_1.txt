To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(A\) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B|A) = 0.80\): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg A) = 0.85\): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.20\): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are actually shorter.

We need to calculate \(P(B)\), the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A)
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
P(B) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(B) = 0.29
\]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
