To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness identification and the prior information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
1. The likelihood of the attacker being under 185 cm: \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)
2. The likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller: \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
3. Probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller: \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \)
4. Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 cm or taller: \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identified someone as 185 cm or taller, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting \( P(B) \) back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
