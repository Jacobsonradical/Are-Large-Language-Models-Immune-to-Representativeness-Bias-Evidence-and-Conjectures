To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the setup:

Let's define:
- \( T \) = "Attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( \neg T \) = "Attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \( W \) = "Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"
- \( P(T) \) = Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W|T) \) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker of 185 cm or taller
- \( P(W|\neg T) \) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller
- \( P(\neg T) \) = Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Based on the provided information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} 
\]

Where \( P(W) \) (the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is given by the law of total probability:
\[
P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T|W) \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.414}
\]
