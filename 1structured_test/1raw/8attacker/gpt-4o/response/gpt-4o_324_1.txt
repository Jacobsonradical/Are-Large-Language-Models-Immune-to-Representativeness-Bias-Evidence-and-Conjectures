To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:

- \(H\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg H\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
1. \(P(H) = 0.15\) (Prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
2. \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \(P(W|H) = 0.80\) (Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
4. \(P(W|\neg H) = 0.20\) (Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \(P(H|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where \(P(W)\) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we can find using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(H|W)\):

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414. 

The final answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
