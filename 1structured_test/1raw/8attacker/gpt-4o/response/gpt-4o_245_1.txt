To determine the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Given data:

- Probabilities in the population:
    - \( P(H \mid A) = 0.15 \) (Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller given an attack)
    - \( P(\neg H \mid A) = 0.85 \) (Probability of attacker being under 185 cm given an attack)
  
- Witness's accuracy:
    - \( P(W \mid H) = 0.80 \) (Probability of witness identifying height as 185 cm or taller given true height is 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(W \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability of witness identifying height as 185 cm or taller given true height is under 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that the general population splits evenly (50% for each category):
\[ P(H) = 0.5 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.5 \]

Using the given information:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.5) + (0.20 \cdot 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, finding \( P(H \mid W) \):
\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.40}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore:
