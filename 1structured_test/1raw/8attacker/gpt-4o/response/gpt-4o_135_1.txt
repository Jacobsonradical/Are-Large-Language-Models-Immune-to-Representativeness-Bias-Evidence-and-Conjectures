To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:

1. \( P(A) = 0.5 \) (since the population distribution is equal)
2. \( P(\neg A) = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(W | A) = 0.8 \) (witness correctly identifies height if attacker is 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(W | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (witness incorrectly identifies height if attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
5. \( P(A | \text{attacker}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
6. \( P(\neg A | \text{attacker}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | W) \):

\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
