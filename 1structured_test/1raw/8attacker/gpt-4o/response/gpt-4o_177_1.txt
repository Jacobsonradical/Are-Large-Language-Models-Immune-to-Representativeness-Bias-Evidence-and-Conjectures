To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \(H\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H^c\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E\): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \(P(H|E)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From information (a), there is a 15% probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E|H)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information (b), this probability is 80% or 0.8.
- \(P(E|H^c)\) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The witness errs 20% of the time, so this probability is 20% or 0.2.
- \(P(H^c)\) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), this is 85% or 0.85.

First, we'll calculate \(P(E)\), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This combines the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

The estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
