To determine the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and the attacker statistics, we can apply Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the events and their probabilities:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The prior probability \( P(H_1) \) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size).
- The prior probability \( P(H_2) \) = 0.5.
- The likelihood \( P(E | H_1) \) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
- The likelihood \( P(E | H_2) \) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time).
- The base rates for attacks: 85% by people shorter than 185 cm, 15% by people 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

To compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) \]
\[ = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ = 0.5 \]

Now plug in the values to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.8 \} \]
