To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (let's call this event \( H \)), we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

First, let's itemize the given information in terms of probability:
- \( P(W|H) = 0.80 \): Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|\neg H) = 0.20 \): Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

To find \( P(W) \), we consider both scenarios (attacker being 185 cm or taller, and attacker being shorter):
\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H|W) \):
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.41}
