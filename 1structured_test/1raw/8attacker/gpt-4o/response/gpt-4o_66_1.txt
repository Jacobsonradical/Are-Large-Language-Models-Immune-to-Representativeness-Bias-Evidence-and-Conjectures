To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we can define the following:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:
  \[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
  \[ P(\neg A) = 0.85 \]
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, this is:
  \[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \]

To find \( P(B) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the answer is:
\{probability: 0.4138\}
