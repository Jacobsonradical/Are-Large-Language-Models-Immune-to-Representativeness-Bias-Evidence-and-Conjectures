To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(T|W) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnessâ€™s identification.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|N) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|N) \cdot P(N) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug this back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.414 \).

The final answer should be formatted as:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
