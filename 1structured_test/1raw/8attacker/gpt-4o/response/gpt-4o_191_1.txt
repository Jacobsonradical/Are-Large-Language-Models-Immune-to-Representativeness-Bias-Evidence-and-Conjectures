To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( H_t \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(H_t | W) \).

### Given information:

- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W | H_t) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W | H_s) = 0.20 \)

### Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]

### Calculation:

\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(H_t | W) \):

\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
