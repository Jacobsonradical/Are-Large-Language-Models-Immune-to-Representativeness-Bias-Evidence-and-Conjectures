We can estimate the probability using Bayes' Theorem. Define the following:

- \( P(H) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H | E) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller (this is what we want to find).
- \( P(E | H) \): Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E | \neg H) \): Probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E | H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Now plug in the values:

\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Next, calculate \( P(H | E) \):

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(H | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
