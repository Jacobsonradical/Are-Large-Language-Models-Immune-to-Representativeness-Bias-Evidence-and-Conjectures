To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(\(\neg\)A) = 0.85 (Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (Witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time if attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (Witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time if attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) P(A) + P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
