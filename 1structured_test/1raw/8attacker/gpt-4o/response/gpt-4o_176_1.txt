To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 

We are interested in \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

where \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(W \mid T) \) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, and \( P(W) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:

- The population is equally split, but 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so:
  \[ P(T) = 0.15 \]
  \[ P(\neg T) = 0.85 \]

- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20%:
  \[ P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \]
  \[ P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \]

Now, to find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
