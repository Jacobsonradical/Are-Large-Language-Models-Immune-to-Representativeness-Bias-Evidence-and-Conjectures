To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

- The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. 
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to compute \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We know:
- \( P(B|A) \): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller. This is 80%.
- \( P(A) \): Base rate probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 15%.

To find \( P(B) \), the total probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate, which is 20%.
- \( P(\neg A) \): Base rate probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85%.

Now we can plug in the values:
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
