To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (population prior for 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \) (population prior for shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|T) = 0.80 \) (witness accuracy for 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness error for shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(T|attack) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T|attack) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \):

\[
P(W) = P(W|T)P(T) + P(W|\neg T)P(\neg T)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W) \):

\[
P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T)P(T)}{P(W)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \}
\]
