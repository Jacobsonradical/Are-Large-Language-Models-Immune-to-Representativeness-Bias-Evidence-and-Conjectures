To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote the following events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]

We need to determine each of these probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|H) \): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:

1. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. So, we can assume:
\[ P(H) = P(\neg H) = 0.5 \]

2. \( 85\% \) of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only \( 15\% \) of attackers are 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(H) = 0.15  \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85  \]

So updating our prior:

\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

3. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time:
\[ P(W|H) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(W|\neg H) = 0.2 \]

Now, we need to calculate \( P(W) \):

\[ P(W) = P(W|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
