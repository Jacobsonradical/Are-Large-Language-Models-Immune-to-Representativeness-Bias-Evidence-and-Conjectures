We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Bayes' theorem is a way of finding a probability when we know certain other probabilities. It is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given the data provided:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, is 0.5 (because the population is equally split by height).
- \( P(A') \), the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is also 0.5.

The witness identification accuracy data gives us two important conditional probabilities:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed taller).
- \( P(B|A') = 0.20 \) (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can find this using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.5) + (0.20 \cdot 0.5) = 0.40 + 0.10 = 0.50 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.5}{0.50} = \frac{0.40}{0.50} = 0.80 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.8 \} \]
