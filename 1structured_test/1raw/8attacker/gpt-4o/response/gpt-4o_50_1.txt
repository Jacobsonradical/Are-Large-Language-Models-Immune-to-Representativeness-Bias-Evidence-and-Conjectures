To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

We need to find each of these probabilities:

1. \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(\neg T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W | T) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W | \neg T) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
5. \( P(W) \): The total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
3. \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for those 185 cm or taller).
4. \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (the witness misidentifies height 20% of the time for those shorter than 185 cm).

We can calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
