To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following terms:

- \(A\) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg A\) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W\) is the event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \(P(A|W)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given:
- \(P(A) = 0.5\) (the population proportion of people 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\neg A) = 0.5\) (the population proportion of people shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W|A) = 0.8\) (witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W|\neg A) = 0.2\) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

From the initial information:
- \(P(atk < 185) = 0.85\) (portion of attackers shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(atk \geq 185) = 0.15\) (portion of attackers 185 cm or taller)

We need \(P(A|W)\). By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) P(A)}{P(W)} \]

First, we find \(P(W)\):

\[ P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W) = 0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, we can find \(P(A|W)\):

\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

{probability: 0.8}
