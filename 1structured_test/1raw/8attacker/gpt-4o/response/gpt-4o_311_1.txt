To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

2. Determine the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(A) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given by the base rate in the population of attackers. According to the information provided, \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
   - \( P(\neg A) \): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

3. Determine the likelihoods:
   - \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.80.
   - \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.20.

4. Calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
   \]
   \[
   P(B) = 0.29
   \]

5. Apply Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(A|B) \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
