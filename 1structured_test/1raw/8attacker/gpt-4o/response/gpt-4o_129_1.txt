To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (population distribution equal between the two height groups)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(\text{Attack | } H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\text{Attack | } H_2) = 0.85 \)

The witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W | H_1) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W | H_2) = 0.2 \)

To find the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | W) \), use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

Firstly, compute \( P(W) \) as a total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 80%.

Therefore:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
