To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Given the data, we have the following information:
- Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
- Prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( P(S) = 0.85 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller \( P(W\mid T) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller \( P(W\mid S) = 0.20 \).

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such: \( P(T\mid W) \).

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(T\mid W) = \frac{P(W\mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to calculate the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W\mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W\mid S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T\mid W) \):
\[ P(T\mid W) = \frac{P(W\mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T\mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T\mid W) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T\mid W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore:
\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
