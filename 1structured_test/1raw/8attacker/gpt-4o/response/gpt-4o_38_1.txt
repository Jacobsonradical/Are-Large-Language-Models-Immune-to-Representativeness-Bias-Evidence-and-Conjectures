To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information given:

- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identified the attacker as taller than 185 cm.

From the given information:

1. The prior probability \( P(T) \):
    - Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, \( P(T) \) and \( P(\lnot T) \) are each 0.5.
    
2. The likelihoods \( P(W \mid T) \) and \( P(W \mid \lnot T) \):
    - The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time: \( P(W \mid T) = 0.8 \).
    - The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time: \( P(W \mid \lnot T) = 0.2 \).

3. Attackers' height distribution given their attack proportion:
    - Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm: \( P(\lnot T \mid \text{attack}) = 0.85 \).
    - Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller: \( P(T \mid \text{attack}) = 0.15 \).

We need to figure out the posterior probability \( P(T \mid W) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Here, \( P(W) \) (the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm) is given by the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \lnot T) \cdot P(\lnot T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identified the attacker as such, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.8} \} \]
