To estimate the probability using the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H_0 \): The attacker is under 185 cm.
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need to determine \( P(H_1 | \text{witness identifies as taller}) \).

Given data:
1. \( P(H_0) = 0.5 \) (population shorter than 185 cm)
2. \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (population 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(\text{attack} | H_0) = 0.85 \)
4. \( P(\text{attack} | H_1) = 0.15 \)
5. \( P(\text{witness} | H_0) = 0.2 \) (Witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller)
6. \( P(\text{witness} | H_1) = 0.8 \) (Witness correctly identifying a taller person)

We need to calculate:
\[ P(H_1 | \text{witness identifies as taller}) \]

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H_1 | \text{witness}) = \frac{P(\text{witness} | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(\text{witness})} \]

Where \( P(\text{witness}) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as taller. Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{witness}) = P(\text{witness} | H_0)P(H_0) + P(\text{witness} | H_1)P(H_1) \]
\[ P(\text{witness}) = (0.2 \times 0.5) + (0.8 \times 0.5) \]
\[ P(\text{witness}) = 0.1 + 0.4 = 0.5 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | \text{witness identifies as taller}) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
