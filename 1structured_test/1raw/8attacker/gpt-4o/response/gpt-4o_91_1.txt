To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here's how we can structure the problem:

- Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( E \) be the evidence provided by the witness.

From the provided information:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (The population split between shorter and taller people is roughly equal)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \) (The witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
   - \( P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \) (The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall 20% of the time)

3. **Conditional Attack Probabilities:**
   - \( P(A | H_1) = 0.15 \) (Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(A | H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | E) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, based on the witness's identification and the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \text{probability: 0.8} \]

So, presenting the final answer in the required format:
