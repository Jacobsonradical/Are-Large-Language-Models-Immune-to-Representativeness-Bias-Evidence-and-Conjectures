To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

First, we establish the given probabilities:

1. \( P(T) = 0.5 \)
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(\text{attacker is 185 cm or taller} | \text{attack occurs}) = 0.15 \)
4. \( P(\text{attacker is shorter than 185 cm} | \text{attack occurs}) = 0.85 \)
5. \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \)
6. \( P(W|\neg T) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Now, we compute \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.5 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(T|W) = 0.8 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.8 \} \]
