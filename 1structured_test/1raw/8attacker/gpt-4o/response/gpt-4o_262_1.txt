To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) = the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( H_2 \) = the attacker is shorter than 185 cm,
- \( E \) = the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.5 \) (50% chance that any person is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(H_2) = 0.5 \) (50% chance that any person is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(E \mid H_1) = 0.8 \) (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(E \mid H_2) = 0.2 \) (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid E) = 0.8 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.
