This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification and prior probabilities.

Let's define the following:
- \(A\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\): The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

The following information is given:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \): The prior probability that any person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A') = 0.5 \): The prior probability that any person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A') = 0.2 \): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.5 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|B) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
