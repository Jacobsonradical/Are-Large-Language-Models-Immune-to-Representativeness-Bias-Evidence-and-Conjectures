To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Let's define the following events:

- \( H_{185+} \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_{<185} \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_{185+} \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find the probability \( P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) \).

Given the information:
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(H_{185+}) = 0.15 \).
- Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( P(H_{<185}) = 0.85 \).
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller \( P(W_{185+} | H_{185+}) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller \( P(W_{185+} | H_{<185}) = 0.20 \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) = \frac{P(W_{185+} | H_{185+}) \cdot P(H_{185+})}{P(W_{185+})} \]
Where:
\[ P(W_{185+}) = P(W_{185+} | H_{185+}) \cdot P(H_{185+}) + P(W_{185+} | H_{<185}) \cdot P(H_{<185}) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(W_{185+}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_{185+}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_{185+}) = 0.29 \]

Now we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) \):
\[ P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{185+} | W_{185+}) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
