To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given the following notations:
- \( T \): event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( F \): event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W \): event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate \( P(T | W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we have:
1. \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is equally likely to be shorter or taller than 185 cm)
2. \( P(F) = 0.5 \)
3. \( P(W | T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W | F) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

Additionally, consider the real rates:
1. \( P(T)_{true} = 0.15 \) (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(F)_{true} = 0.85 \) (85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where \( P(W) \) is:
\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | F) \cdot P(F) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]

Rounding to a two-decimal precision as requested:

\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
