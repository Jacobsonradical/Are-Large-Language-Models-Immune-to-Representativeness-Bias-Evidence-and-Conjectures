To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): The witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
  
We want to compute \( P(A|W) \), i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.5 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W|B) = 0.2 \)

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} \]
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(A|W) = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ {probability: 0.8} \]
