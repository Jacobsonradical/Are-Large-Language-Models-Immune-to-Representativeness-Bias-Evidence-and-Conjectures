To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we are interested in finding \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Witness Identified Tall}) \).

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_T \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \) (since the population is split equally at the 185 cm mark).
- \( P(S) = 0.5 \).
- \( P(W_T | T) = 0.8 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies a tall person).
- \( P(W_T | S) = 0.2 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall).

We need to find \( P(T | W_T) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{P(W_T | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_T)} \]

Where \( P(W_T) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as tall:

\[ P(W_T) = P(W_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_T | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W_T) = (0.8 \times 0.5) + (0.2 \times 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_T) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.5}{0.5} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
