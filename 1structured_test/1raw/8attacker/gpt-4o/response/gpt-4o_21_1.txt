To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and the general population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

From the information provided:

1. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller, so \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \).
2. The prior probabilities are:
   - \( P(A) \) (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
   - The prior probability for someone shorter than 185 cm is \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \).
3. The witness makes an error 20% of the time, so the probability that the witness identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \).

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
