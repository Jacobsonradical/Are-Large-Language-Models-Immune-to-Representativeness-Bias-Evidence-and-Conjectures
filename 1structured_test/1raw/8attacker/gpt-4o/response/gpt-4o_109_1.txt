To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. We denote:

- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability of \( H_1 \).
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the witness identifying an attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we set the values based on the information provided:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   \[ P(H_1) = 0.5 \]
   \[ P(H_2) = 0.5 \]

2. **Likelihoods**:
   \[ P(E | H_1) = 0.8 \]
   \[ P(E | H_2) = 0.2 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.5) + (0.2 \cdot 0.5) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.5 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.4}{0.5} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = 0.8 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{probability: 0.8\} \]
