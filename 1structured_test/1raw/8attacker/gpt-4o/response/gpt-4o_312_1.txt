To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T = \) Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N = \) Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W = \) Event that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T|W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{P(W|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|T) \) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the height as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the overall probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.5 \times 0.15 = 0.075 \) (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller who commit such attacks).
- \( P(N) = 0.5 \times 0.85 = 0.425 \) (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm who commit such attacks).
- \( P(W|T) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identified attackers 80% of the time as taller than 185 cm).
- \( P(W|N) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identified attackers 20% of the time as taller than 185 cm).

Next, we calculate \( P(W) \):
\[ P(W) = P(W|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W|N) \cdot P(N) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.8 \cdot 0.075) + (0.2 \cdot 0.425) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.06 + 0.085 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.145 \]

Now we substitute the values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.075}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T|W) = \frac{0.06}{0.145} \]
\[ P(T|W) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
