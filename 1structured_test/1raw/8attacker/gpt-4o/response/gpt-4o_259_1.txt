We can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \) as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding \( P(T | W) \).

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W | T) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | T) = 0.80 \) (witness's accuracy in correctly identifying height as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (witness's error in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Next, we need to calculate \( P(W) \), the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W) \):

\[ P(T | W) = \frac{P(W | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
