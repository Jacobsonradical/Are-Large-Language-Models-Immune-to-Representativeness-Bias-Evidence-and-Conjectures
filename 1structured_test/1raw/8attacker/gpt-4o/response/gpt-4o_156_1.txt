To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is less than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being less than 185 cm)
- \( P(E|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone less than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

First, we need to calculate \( P(E) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E) = P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E|H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1|E) \):
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{P(E|H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.414 \} \]
