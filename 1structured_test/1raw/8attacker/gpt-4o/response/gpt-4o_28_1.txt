To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W \): Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \) (probability the witness identifies height correctly given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability the witness identifies height incorrectly given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to calculate \( P(T \mid W) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
