To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.

We need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(B) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \] 
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138, which can be stated as:

{probability: 0.41}
