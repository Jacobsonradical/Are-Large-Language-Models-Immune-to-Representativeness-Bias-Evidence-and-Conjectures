To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( A_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A_1) = 0.5 \) (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A_2) = 0.5 \) (the other half is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E | A_1) = 0.8 \) (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E | A_2) = 0.2 \) (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(A_1 | \text{attack}) = 0.15 \) (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A_2 | \text{attack}) = 0.85 \) (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We are interested in \( P(A_1 | E) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(E | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(E | A_2) \cdot P(A_2)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(A_1 | E) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.5}{0.8 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.5} \]

\[ P(A_1 | E) = \frac{0.4}{0.4 + 0.1} = \frac{0.4}{0.5} = 0.8 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
