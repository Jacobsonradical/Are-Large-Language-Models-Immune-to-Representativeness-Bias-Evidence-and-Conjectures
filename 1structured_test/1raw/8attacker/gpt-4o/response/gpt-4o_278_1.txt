To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's set the following:

- Let \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( H_0 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the witness's identification that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W)} \]

Where:

- \( P(H_1 | W) \) is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.
- \( P(W | H_1) \) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have the following information:

- The prior probability \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- The prior probability \( P(H_0) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of such attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
- The accuracy of the witness \( P(W | H_1) = 0.80 \) (correct identification when attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- The error rate of the witness \( P(W | H_0) = 0.20 \) (incorrect identification when attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The total probability \( P(W) \) is calculated as:

\[ P(W) = P(W | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W | H_0) \cdot P(H_0) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | W) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
