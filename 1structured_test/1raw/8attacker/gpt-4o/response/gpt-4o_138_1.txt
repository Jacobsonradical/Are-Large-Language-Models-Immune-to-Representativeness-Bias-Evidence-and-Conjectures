To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps and calculations:

**Step 1: Define the probabilities**
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( A' \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (because 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \) (because 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W | A) = 0.80 \) (witness correctly identifies height for taller attackers 80% of the time)
- \( P(W | A') = 0.20 \) (witness incorrectly identifies shorter attackers as taller 20% of the time)

**Step 2: Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A | W) \)**
Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{P(W | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)} \]

To find \( P(W) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W) = P(W | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W | A') \cdot P(A') \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

So, the best estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is:
