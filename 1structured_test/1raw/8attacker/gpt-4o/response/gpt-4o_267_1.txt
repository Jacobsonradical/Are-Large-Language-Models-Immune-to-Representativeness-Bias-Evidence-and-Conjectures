To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W|A) \) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W) \) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W|A') = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

To find \( P(W) \), we need to calculate the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W) = P(W|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W|A') \cdot P(A')
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W) = 0.29
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|W) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
{ probability: 0.414 }
\]
