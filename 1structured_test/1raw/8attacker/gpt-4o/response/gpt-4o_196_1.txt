To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's define:

- \( H_1 \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

According to the provided data:

- Prior probabilities (\( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \)):
  \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
  \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

- Witness accuracy:
  \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
  \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)

We need to determine the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(W_1) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.29
\]

Now, use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
