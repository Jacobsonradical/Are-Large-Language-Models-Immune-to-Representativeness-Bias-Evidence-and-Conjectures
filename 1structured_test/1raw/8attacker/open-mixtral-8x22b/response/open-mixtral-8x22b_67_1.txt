To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs (base rate) with new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's denote:
A = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B = The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time)

To calculate P(B), we have to consider both cases when the witness is correct and when the witness is incorrect:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Since P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm):
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41.
