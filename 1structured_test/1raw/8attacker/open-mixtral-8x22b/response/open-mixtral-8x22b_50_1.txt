To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information, the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. So, if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

However, we also know that the population distribution of attackers' heights is not equally distributed despite the general population being roughly equal. Specifically, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To find the final probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (the distribution of attackers' heights) with the new information from the witness.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the distribution of attackers' heights).

P(B) is the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., less than 185 cm).

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (from the witness's error rate).

P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85 (from the distribution of attackers' heights).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
