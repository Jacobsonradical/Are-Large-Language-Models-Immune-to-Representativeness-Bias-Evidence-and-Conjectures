To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know the following:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

Now we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. This can be found by considering both cases, where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm), and we can assume that P(B|not A) is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (20% error rate).

So:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.23

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.5217

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.5217, or 52.17%.

Answer:
{probability: 0.5217}
