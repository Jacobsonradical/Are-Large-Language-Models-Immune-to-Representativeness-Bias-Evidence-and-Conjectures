To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's consider the population distribution:
P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.5
P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5

Now, let's consider the probability distribution of attackers' heights:
P(Attacker | Height < 185 cm) = 0.85
P(Attacker | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy:
P(Witness identifies correctly | Height < 185 cm) = 0.8
P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies correctly) = P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness identifies correctly)

To calculate P(Witness identifies correctly), we need to consider both possibilities:
P(Witness identifies correctly) = P(Witness identifies correctly | Height < 185 cm) * P(Height < 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.8 * 0.5
= 0.8

Now we can calculate the probability of interest:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies correctly) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.8
= 0.5

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.5 (50%).
