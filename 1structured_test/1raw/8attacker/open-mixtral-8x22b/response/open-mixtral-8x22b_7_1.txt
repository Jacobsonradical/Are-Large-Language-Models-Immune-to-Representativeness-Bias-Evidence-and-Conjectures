To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information given about the population distribution and the witness's ability to accurately identify height.

First, let's consider the population distribution:
- The population is equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

This means that, without any additional information, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based solely on the distribution of attacker heights.

Next, let's consider the witness's testimony:
- The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.

To account for the witness's testimony, we need to consider two scenarios:
1. The witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given the witness's accuracy, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct and a 20% chance that the witness is incorrect. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, as follows:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness) = P(Witness correct) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)
                                                  = 0.8 * 0.15
                                                  = 0.12

So, based on the witness's testimony, there is a 12% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.12}
