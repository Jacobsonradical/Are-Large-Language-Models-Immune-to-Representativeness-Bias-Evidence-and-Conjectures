To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities from the given information:

P(A): The probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller).

P(not A): The probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85.

P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time).

P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / [P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A)]

Substitute the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculate the result:

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)] â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
