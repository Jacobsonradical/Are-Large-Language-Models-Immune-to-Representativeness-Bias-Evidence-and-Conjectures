To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / P(W)

Let's compute the terms:

1. P(W|H): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(W|H) = 0.8.

2. P(H): The probability that any given person is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.5. However, considering the context of the attackers, only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

3. P(W): The probability that the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness makes an error in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(W) = P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|~H) * P(~H), where ~H is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, and P(W|~H) is the probability that the witness makes an error when identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
