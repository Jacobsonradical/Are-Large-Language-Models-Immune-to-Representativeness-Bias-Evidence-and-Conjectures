To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the two pieces of information using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we know that P(A) = 0.15, which is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information, this is 0.80.

We also need to find P(B|~A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. According to the information, the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases, so P(B|~A) = 0.20.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Substitute the known values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

Calculate the result:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2609

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2609.
