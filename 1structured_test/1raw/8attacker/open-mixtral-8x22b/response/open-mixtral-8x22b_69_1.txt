To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy in judging height and the distribution of attacker heights in the population.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. Given a sample of people with half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. This means that the witness's accuracy for identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller is 80%.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights in the population. According to the information given, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they actually were. According to the information given, this is 80%.

P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 15%.

P(B) is the probability that the witness identified a random person as being 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we need to consider both the probability that the witness correctly identified a person who is 185 cm or taller and the probability that they incorrectly identified a person who is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] + [P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identified a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is 80% accurate, this means that they incorrectly identify someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

P(~A) is the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to the information given, this is 85%.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] + [0.2 \* 0.85]

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
