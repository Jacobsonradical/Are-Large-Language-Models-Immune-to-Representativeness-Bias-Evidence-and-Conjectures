To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy in judging height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

From the information given, we know the following:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying people 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)

We also know that the witness will be correct 80% of the time regardless of the attacker's height, so:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A)
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85)

After simplifying the equation, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15

However, we need to consider the fact that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, which means that P(A) should be closer to 0.5. In this case, the calculation would be:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / (0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.8

But since the information provided specifies that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, we should use the first calculation:

P(A|W) = 0.15

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
