To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the given information about the population distribution and the witness's accuracy.

First, let's consider the population distribution:
- 50% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
- 50% of people are 185 cm or taller.

However, among attackers, the distribution is different:
- 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's incorporate the witness's accuracy:
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
- The witness makes an error in 20% of cases.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement, we need to consider both the population distribution among attackers and the witness's accuracy.

The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller is:
P(correct) = P(attacker 185 cm or taller) * P(witness correct)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller is:
P(incorrect) = P(attacker shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness incorrect)
= 0.85 * 0.2
= 0.17

To find the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the witness's statement, we need to add the probabilities of the witness being correct and incorrect:
P(total) = P(correct) + P(incorrect)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Therefore, based on the given information and calculations, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.
