To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is under 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are under 185 cm)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.22

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.5455

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.5455.
