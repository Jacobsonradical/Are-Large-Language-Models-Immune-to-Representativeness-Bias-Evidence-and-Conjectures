To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability (given by the base rates of heights among attackers) and the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the height.

First, let's consider the prior probability:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (15%)
P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85%)

Now, let's consider the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the height:
P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (80%)
P(Witness says < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.2 (20%)

P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (20%)
P(Witness says < 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.8 (80%)

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm)

To find P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm), we can use the law of total probability:
P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find the desired probability:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
