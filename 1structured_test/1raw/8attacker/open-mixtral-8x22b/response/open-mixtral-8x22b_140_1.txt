To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we are interested in the True Positive Rate (TPR), which is the proportion of true positives (correctly identified as 185 cm or taller) out of all actual positives (people who are 185 cm or taller).

Assuming the witness's errors are equally likely to be false positives (wrongly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) and false negatives (wrongly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm), the TPR would be 80%, as the witness is right 80% of the time.

Now, let's consider the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this is 15%.

To estimate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

We know P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 15%, or 0.15, and we've assumed that P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 80%, or 0.8.

However, we don't have the information to calculate P(Witness Identification), which would require knowing the witness's identification rate for people both shorter and taller than 185 cm.

Nonetheless, we can still estimate a lower bound for the posterior probability by considering the TPR and the prior probability. Since the witness's identification is evidence towards the attacker being 185 cm or taller, the posterior probability must be at least as high as the prior probability (unless the witness's identification is completely uninformative, which would give a posterior probability equal to the prior).

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is at least 15%, or 0.15. However, this is a lower bound, and the true probability could be higher, depending on the witness's overall identification rate.

Please note that this is a simplified analysis and may not capture all the complexities of the situation. For a more accurate estimate, additional information about the witness's identification rate would be needed.
