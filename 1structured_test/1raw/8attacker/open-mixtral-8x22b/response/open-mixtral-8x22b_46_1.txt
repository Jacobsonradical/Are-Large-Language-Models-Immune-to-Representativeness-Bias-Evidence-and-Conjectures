To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to their joint and marginal probabilities. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80%, or 0.8.

P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 20%, or 0.2, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

P(A): The probability that any given person in the population is 185 cm or taller. We are told that this is roughly 50%, or 0.5.

P(¬A): The probability that any given person in the population is shorter than 185 cm. This is also roughly 50%, or 0.5.

P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. This is the probability we want to estimate.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]

P(A|B) = (0.4) / [(0.4) + (0.1)]

P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(A|B) = 0.8

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is $0.8$  or 80%. This accounts for both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

However, we should also consider the additional information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This suggests that the base rate for attackers who are 185 cm or taller is actually much lower than the base rate for the general population.

To account for this, we can adjust the calculation as follows:

P(A): The probability that any given attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 15%, or 0.15.

P(¬A): The probability that any given attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85%, or 0.85.

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

So, taking into account the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 41%. This is a significant decrease from the estimate based solely on the witness's accuracy and the base rate for the general population.
