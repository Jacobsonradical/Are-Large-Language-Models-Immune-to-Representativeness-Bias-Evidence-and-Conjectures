To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately judge height and the actual distribution of attacker heights.

From the information given, the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance the witness would correctly identify them as such. However, there is also a 20% chance the witness could make an error and incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller.

Additionally, we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that even if the witness makes an error, there is still a higher likelihood that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The probability of A (attacker being 185 cm or taller) is 0.15. The probability of B given A (witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller) is 0.80. The probability of B (witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller) is the sum of the probabilities of B given A and B given not A, which is 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85.

So, the probability of A given B (attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such) is (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.36.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
