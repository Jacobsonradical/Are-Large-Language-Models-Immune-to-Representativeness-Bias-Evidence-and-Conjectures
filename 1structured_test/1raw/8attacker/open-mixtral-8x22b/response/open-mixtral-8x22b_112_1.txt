To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.5 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller)
P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such, which is the probability we want to estimate.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know P(~A) = 0.5 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm), and we can calculate P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller).

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5] = 0.8 / 0.9 = 8/9 â‰ˆ 0.889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889.
