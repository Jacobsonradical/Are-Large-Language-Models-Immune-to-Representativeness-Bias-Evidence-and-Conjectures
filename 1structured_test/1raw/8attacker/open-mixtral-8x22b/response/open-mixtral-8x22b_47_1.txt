To estimate the probability, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and understand how they interact.

From (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. This means that if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them as such 80% of the time. However, there is a 20% chance that the witness might incorrectly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller.

From (b), we know that in the population of potential attackers, only 15% are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter. This means that, prior to any witness identification, the probability of a randomly selected attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

We know that P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.80 (from a), P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from b), and we need to find P(Witness Identification).

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Height < 185 cm) * P(Height < 185 cm)

We know that P(Witness Identification | Height < 185 cm) = 0.20 (from a), and P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.85 (from b).

So, P(Witness Identification) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification):

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, given the witness's identification and the base rates, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
