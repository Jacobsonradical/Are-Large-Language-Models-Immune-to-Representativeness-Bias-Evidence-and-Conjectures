To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's define our events:
A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Our prior probability, P(A), is the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, this is 15%.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.35

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.35, or 35%.
