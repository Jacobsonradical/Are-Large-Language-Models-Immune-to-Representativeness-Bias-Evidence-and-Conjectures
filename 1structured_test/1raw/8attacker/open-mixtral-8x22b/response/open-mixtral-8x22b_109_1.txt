To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is equal to the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, times the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case, let's define:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we can find the following probabilities:

1. P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15, since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.80, since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
3. P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 20% or 0.20, since the witness makes errors in 20% of cases.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is equal to 85% or 0.85.

Now, let's plug the values into the formula:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.308

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.308 or 30.8%.
