To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief with new evidence. In this case, the prior belief is the population distribution of heights, and the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

First, let's define some variables:

P(H) = Prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, the population distribution is roughly equal, so P(H) = 0.5.

P(E|H) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, the witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.

P(E|~H) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the information given, the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2.

P(~H) = Prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm. Since the population distribution is roughly equal, P(~H) = 0.5.

P(E) = Probability that the witness identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the person's actual height. This can be calculated as: P(E) = P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8.

So, based on the witness's testimony and the given population distribution, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

However, we also have additional information that only 15% of such attackers are people 185 cm or taller. This is a separate piece of evidence that needs to be considered.

Let's denote this new piece of evidence as A (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the contrary as ~A (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

P(A) = 0.15, and P(~A) = 0.85.

Now, we can update our belief again by considering both pieces of evidence:

P(H|E, A) = P(E|H, A) * P(H|A) / P(E|A) = P(E|H) * P(A|H) / P(E|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.41.

So, the final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both pieces of evidence, is 0.41.
