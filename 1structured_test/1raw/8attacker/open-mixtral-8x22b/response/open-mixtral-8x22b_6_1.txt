To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B has occurred. In this case, it's the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A has occurred. Here, it's the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A, which is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 50% in the general population and 15% among attackers.
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B, which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

First, let's calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. We know that the witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify 40% of people as 185 cm or taller (0.8 * 0.5). The witness will also incorrectly identify 10% of people as 185 cm or taller (0.2 * 0.5), since 10% of people are shorter than 185 cm but are identified as being 185 cm or taller by the witness. Therefore, P(B) is 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5, or 50%.

Now, let's calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.24, or 24%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24.

{probability: 0.24}
