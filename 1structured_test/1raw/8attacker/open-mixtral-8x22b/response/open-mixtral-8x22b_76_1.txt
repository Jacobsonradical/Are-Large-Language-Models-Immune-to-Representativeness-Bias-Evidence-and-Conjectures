To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such).
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they were indeed 185 cm or taller).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a random person as 185 cm or taller).

From the information given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the witness is correct and where they are incorrect. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify 80% of these and incorrectly identify 20% of the other half (shorter than 185 cm). Therefore:

P(B) = (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.12 / 0.5 = 0.24

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.24. However, this probability is conditioned on the witness's identification being correct. Since the witness could be wrong 20% of the time, we need to account for this. The probability that the witness is correct about the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

P(correct) = 0.8 * 0.24 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.24) = 0.192 + 0.168 = 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
