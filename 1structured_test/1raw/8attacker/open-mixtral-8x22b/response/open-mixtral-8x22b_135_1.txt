To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is useful for calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (H) given that the witness identified the attacker as such (E).

Let's denote:
- P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to information "b", P(H) = 0.15.
- P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to information "a", P(E|H) = 0.8.
- P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. According to information "a", P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now, Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Here, P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Simplifying, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.

Final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.4138}
