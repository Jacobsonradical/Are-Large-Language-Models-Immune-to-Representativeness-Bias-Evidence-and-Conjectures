To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of such attackers (15%) and the witness's reliability in identifying height (80% accuracy).

Let's denote "A" as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and "W" as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We know that P(W|A) is the witness's accuracy in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they indeed are, which is 80% or 0.8. P(A) is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')

where P(A') is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85), and P(W|A') is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter (20% or 0.2, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

So, P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41379.
