To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
D: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

According to the information given:
P(W|D) = 0.8 (The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(W|~D) = 0.2 (The witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm)
P(D) = 0.15 (According to the population statistics, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(~D) = 0.85 (According to the population statistics, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(D|W) = P(W|D) * P(D) / [P(W|D) * P(D) + P(W|~D) * P(~D)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(D|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(D|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(D|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(D|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately $0.4138$ .
