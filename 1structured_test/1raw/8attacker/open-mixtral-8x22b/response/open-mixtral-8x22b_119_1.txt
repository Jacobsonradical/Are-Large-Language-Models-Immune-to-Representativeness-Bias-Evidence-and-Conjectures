To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability (given the population distribution and attacker statistics) and the likelihood of the witness's identification (given the witness's accuracy).

Prior probability (P(H)):
- P(H1) = Probability that the attacker is under 185 cm = 85% = 0.85
- P(H2) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15

Likelihood (P(E|H)):
- P(E|H1) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually under 185 cm = 20% = 0.2 (incorrect identification)
- P(E|H2) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8 (correct identification)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(H2|E) = P(E|H2) \* P(H2) / (P(E|H2) \* P(H2) + P(E|H1) \* P(H1))

Substitute the values:

P(H2|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85))

Calculate the result:

P(H2|E) â‰ˆ 0.364

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.364 or 36.4%.
