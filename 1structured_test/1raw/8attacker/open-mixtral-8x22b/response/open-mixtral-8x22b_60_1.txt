To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the population distribution of attackers' heights.

Let's denote:
- Event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A), the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15%.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, P(B|not A). Given that the witness makes mistakes in 20% of the cases and the population is equally divided between people shorter and taller than 185 cm, we can infer that P(B|not A) is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can compute the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such, P(A|B). We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the population distribution of attackers' heights, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
