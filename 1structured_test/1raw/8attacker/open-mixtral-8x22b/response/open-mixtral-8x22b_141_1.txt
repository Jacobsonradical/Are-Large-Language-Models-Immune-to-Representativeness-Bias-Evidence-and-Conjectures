To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the population distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to identify height. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time, we can assume that when the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance that the witness made an error.

Next, let's consider the population distribution of attacker heights. Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can assume that, prior to any witness testimony, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (our desired probability)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller (0.80)
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
