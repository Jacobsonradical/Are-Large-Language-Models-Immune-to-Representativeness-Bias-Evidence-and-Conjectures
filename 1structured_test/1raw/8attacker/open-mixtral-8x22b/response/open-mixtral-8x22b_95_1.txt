To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the general distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the information from the witness. The witness correctly identified a person's height as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. However, this also means that the witness incorrectly identified a person's height as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, even if the person was actually shorter.

Second, let's consider the general distribution of attacker heights. In the general population, the number of people shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal to the number of people 185 cm or taller. However, among attackers, only 15% are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine these two pieces of information. The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as the probability that the witness was correct about the attacker's height (80%) multiplied by the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (15%), plus the probability that the witness was incorrect (20%) multiplied by the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85%).

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

P(Attacker 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness correct) * P(Random attacker 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness incorrect) * P(Random attacker shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.29 (or 29%).
