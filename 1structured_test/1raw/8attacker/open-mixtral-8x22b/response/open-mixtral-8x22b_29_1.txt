To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random attacker is under 185 cm)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3158

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.3158.
