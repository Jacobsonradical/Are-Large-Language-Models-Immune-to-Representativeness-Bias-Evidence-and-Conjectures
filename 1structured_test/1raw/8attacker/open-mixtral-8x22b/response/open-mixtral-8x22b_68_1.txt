To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A given that B is true. In this case, it's the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given that A is true. In this case, it's the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A. In this case, it's the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B. In this case, it's the probability that the witness identified a random individual as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time for taller people and 20% of the time for shorter people)

So, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24 / 0.5 = 0.48

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.48.
