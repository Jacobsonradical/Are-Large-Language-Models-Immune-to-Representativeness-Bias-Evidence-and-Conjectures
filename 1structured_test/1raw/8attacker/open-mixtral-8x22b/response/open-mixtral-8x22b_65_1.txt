To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy and the base rate of attacker heights in the population.

From the witness's testimony, we know that they correctly identified height 80% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the base rate, or prior probability, that the attacker is tall.

To estimate the probability that the attacker was tall, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability the witness identifies someone as tall given that they are tall)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability the attacker is tall)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability the witness identifies someone as tall)

In this case, we want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

We know that P(B|A) is 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) is 15% or 0.15 (the base rate of tall attackers), and P(B) is the sum of the witness's accuracy in identifying tall people and their error rate in identifying short people as tall, which is 80% * 15% + 20% * 85% = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
