To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately identify height and the distribution of attacker heights in the population.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the witness is correct, and a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights. According to the information provided, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that, regardless of the witness's testimony, there's a lower probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, simply due to the distribution of heights among attackers.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- P(H) is the probability of the hypothesis (prior to observing the evidence).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (regardless of the hypothesis).

In this case:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We know that:
- P(E|H) is 80% or 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
- P(H) is 15% or 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).
- P(E) is the total probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is a combination of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

To calculate P(E), we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attacker heights. The witness will correctly identify 185 cm or taller attackers 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify shorter attackers as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

So, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.41379310344827586

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attacker heights, is approximately 0.414.
