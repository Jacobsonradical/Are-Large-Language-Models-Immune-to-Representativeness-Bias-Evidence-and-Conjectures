To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness says someone is 185 cm or taller, they are correct 80% of the time.

However, we also need to consider the base rate of attacker heights. According to the information provided, only 15% of such attackers are people 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is proportional to the prior probability of the event (the base rate of attacker heights) multiplied by the likelihood of the evidence (the witness's accuracy).

The calculation would look like this:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

We know that P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), and P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (the base rate of attacker heights).

P(Witness Identification) is the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness being correct and the probability of the witness being incorrect: P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm).

However, we don't have the value of P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm), which is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller. This is the 20% error rate of the witness, but we don't know how this error is distributed between people shorter and taller than 185 cm.

Without this information, we can't accurately calculate the posterior probability. However, we can say that the posterior probability will be less than 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), because the base rate of attacker heights is only 0.15.

So, a rough estimate, assuming that the witness's errors are equally likely to occur for people shorter and taller than 185 cm, would be around 0.15 (the base rate of attacker heights) * 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) = 0.12. But again, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different depending on the distribution of the witness's errors.
