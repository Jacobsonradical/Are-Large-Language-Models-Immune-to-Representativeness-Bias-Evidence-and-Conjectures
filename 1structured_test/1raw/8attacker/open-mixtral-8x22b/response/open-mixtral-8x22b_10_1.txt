To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on evidence. In this case, we have two pieces of information that can help us:

1. The witness's accuracy in identifying height.
2. The distribution of attacker heights in the population.

Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:

P(B|A) = 0.80

Next, let's find P(A), which is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.15

Now, let's find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. We can calculate this by considering the witness's accuracy and the distribution of heights in the population:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
