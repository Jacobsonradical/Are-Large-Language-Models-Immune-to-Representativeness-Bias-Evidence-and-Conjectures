To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find (the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification).
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to the information, this is 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller regardless of the witness's identification. According to the information, this is 15%.
- P(B) is the probability of B, which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the actual height. This can be calculated by considering both the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the information, this is 20%.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
