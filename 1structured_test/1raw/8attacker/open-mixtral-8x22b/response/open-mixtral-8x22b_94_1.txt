To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem.

Given:
Prior probability (P(H)) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (Since the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm)
Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(A|H)) = 0.15 (Since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
Probability that a witness correctly identifies a person's height (P(E|H)) = 0.8 (80% of the time the witness correctly identifies the height)

We want to find the posterior probability (P(H|A,E)), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such under the given conditions.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(H|A,E) = P(A,E|H) * P(H) / [P(A,E|H) * P(H) + P(A,E|~H) * P(~H)]

We know that P(A,E|H) = P(E|H) * P(A|H) (The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness identified them correctly)
P(A,E|~H) = P(E|~H) * P(A|~H) (The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identified them as 185 cm or taller)

Since P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and we know P(H) = 0.5, then P(~H) = 0.5.

Now we can calculate P(A,E|H):
P(A,E|H) = P(E|H) * P(A|H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

And P(A,E|~H):
P(A,E|~H) = (1 - P(E|H)) * P(A|~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|A,E):
P(H|A,E) = P(A,E|H) * P(H) / [P(A,E|H) * P(H) + P(A,E|~H) * P(~H)]
P(H|A,E) = (0.12 * 0.5) / [(0.12 * 0.5) + (0.17 * 0.5)]
P(H|A,E) = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.085)
P(H|A,E) = 0.06 / 0.145
P(H|A,E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the base rates of height and attacker height, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
