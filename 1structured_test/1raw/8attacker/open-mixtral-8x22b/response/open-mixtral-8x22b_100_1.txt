To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's reliability and the general distribution of attacker heights.

Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we can assume that there's an 80% chance that the witness is correct in this situation. However, we also know that only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to multiply these two probabilities together:

Probability (witness is correct) * Probability (attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm but was incorrectly identified as being 185 cm or taller.

Probability (witness is wrong) * Probability (attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

To find the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we add these two probabilities together:

Total Probability = Probability (correct) + Probability (witness is wrong but identifies as tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.29 or 29%.
