To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in judging height and the population distribution of attackers' heights.

From the witness's testimony, we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. However, due to the nature of the attack, the witness might not have been in the best position to accurately judge the height. So, we should consider the possibility of error in the witness's judgement.

From the population distribution, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that, based on the population distribution alone, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

However, we also have the witness's testimony, which suggests a higher probability. To estimate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (the population distribution) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, according to the witness's accuracy.
- P(A) is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 from the population distribution.
- P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as the weighted sum of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that they are wrong: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since P(not A) is 0.85 and P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness makes a mistake, which is 0.2, we have P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.3.

Putting it all together:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.4

So, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.

However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different due to various factors not considered in this analysis, such as the witness's potential bias or the possibility of an extremely tall attacker.
