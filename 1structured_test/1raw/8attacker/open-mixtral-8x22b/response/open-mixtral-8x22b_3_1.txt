To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
- The prior probability P(A) of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.
- The probability P(B|A) of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as being 185 cm or taller is 80%.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The witness will correctly identify the attacker's height 80% of the time in both cases and will be wrong 20% of the time.

So, P(B) = 0.8 \* P(A) + 0.2 \* (1 - P(A))

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
