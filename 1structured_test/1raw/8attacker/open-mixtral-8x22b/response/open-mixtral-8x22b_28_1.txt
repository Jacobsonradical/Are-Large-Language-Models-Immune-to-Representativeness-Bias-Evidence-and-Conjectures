To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and perform a Bayesian analysis.

First, let's consider the witness's ability to correctly identify a person's height. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that the witness has a 0.8 probability of correctly identifying a person's height and a 0.2 probability of incorrectly identifying a person's height.

Next, let's consider the information about the population of attackers. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

We know that P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

P(Witness Identification) is the overall probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

Since P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2. P(Attacker < 185 cm) is the prior probability of an attacker being under 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

P(Witness Identification) = 0.12 + 0.17

P(Witness Identification) = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identification):

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) ≈ 0.39

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.39 or 39%.
