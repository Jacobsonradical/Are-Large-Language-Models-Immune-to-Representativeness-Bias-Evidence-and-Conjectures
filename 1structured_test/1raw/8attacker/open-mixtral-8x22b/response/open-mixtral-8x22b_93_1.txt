To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's ability to accurately judge height and the base rate of attackers' heights.

From the information given, we can break this down as follows:

1. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness would have correctly identified them as such.

2. The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the base rate that we need to adjust our estimate based on the witness's testimony.

To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability: the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- P(E|H) is the likelihood: the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller (0.80).
- P(H) is the prior probability: the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's testimony (0.15).
- P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller (this is the false positive rate, which we can calculate as 1 - 0.80 = 0.20).
- P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] = 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.

Here is the final answer:
{probability: 0.36}
