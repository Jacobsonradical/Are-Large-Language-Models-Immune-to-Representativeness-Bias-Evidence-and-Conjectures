To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to the given information:

P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

P(¬A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.37

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.37 or 37%.
