To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability (based on the general population statistics) and the likelihood based on the witness's testimony.

1. Prior probability: If 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, but only 15% of attackers fall into this category, then the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

2. Likelihood based on the witness's testimony: The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. If the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is incorrect.

   - If the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness identifying them correctly is 0.8 (80%).
   - If the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).

3. To calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness testimony)

We know:

- P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
- P(Witness testimony | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8
- P(Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness testimony | Attacker < 185 cm) \* P(Attacker < 185 cm)

Since the population is divided equally, P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.5.

P(Witness testimony | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness being incorrect).

Now, we can calculate P(Witness testimony):

P(Witness testimony) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.22 ≈ 0.5455 (54.55%)

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5455 (54.55%).
