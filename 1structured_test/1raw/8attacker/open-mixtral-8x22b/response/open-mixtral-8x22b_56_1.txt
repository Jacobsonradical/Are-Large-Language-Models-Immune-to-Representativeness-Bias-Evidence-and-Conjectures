To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) is the probability of A (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

From the information given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615.
