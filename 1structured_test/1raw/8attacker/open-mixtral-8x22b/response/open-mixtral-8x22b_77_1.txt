To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two pieces of information: the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so we can assume that the probability of the witness being correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually 185 cm or taller. This means that the base rate probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To estimate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (the witness's testimony).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the base rate probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height).

We can calculate P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where:
- P(E|¬H) is the probability of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).
- P(¬H) is the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis (the base rate probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Given that the witness is wrong 20% of the time:
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2
- P(¬H) = 0.85

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
