To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:

- Event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the given information:

- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter)

First, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.41.
