To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) given.

From information (a), we know that the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying a person's height, with a margin of error of 20%. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

However, from information (b), we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Despite this, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, while 85% are under 185 cm. This suggests that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To get the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can use a simplified version of the theorem because we have the accuracy of the witness's identification and the prior probability of the attacker's height.

Let's denote:
P(H) = prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(E|H) = probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8

The posterior probability P(H|E) is then calculated as follows:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We know P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15. We also know that the witness is wrong 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (~H) is 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
