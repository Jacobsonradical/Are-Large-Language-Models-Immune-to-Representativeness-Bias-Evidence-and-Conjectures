To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy and the general distribution of attacker heights.

The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are incorrect.

However, we also know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This indicates a prior probability that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm)

Using the given probabilities:

P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (distribution of attacker heights)
P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm)

But P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | attacker < 185 cm) is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2. And P(attacker < 185 cm) is 0.85.

So, P(witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.31.

Finally, P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.31 ≈ 0.387.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.387.
