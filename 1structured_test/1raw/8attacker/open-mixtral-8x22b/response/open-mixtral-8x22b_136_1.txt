To estimate the probability, we need to consider both pieces of information and combine them appropriately.

Firstly, from information "a", we know that the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height and a 20% chance of making an error. So, if the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct, and a 20% chance they are wrong.

Secondly, from information "b", we know that in the general population, the number of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal. However, when considering attackers, only 15% of them are 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we need to consider the witness's testimony in light of the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. This is done using Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs (the base rate of tall attackers) with new evidence (the witness's testimony).

The calculation would look something like this:

Posterior probability (that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony) = [Prior probability (that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller) * Likelihood (of witness identifying a tall person as tall)] / [Prior probability * Likelihood + Prior probability (that a random attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * Likelihood (of witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall)]

Substituting the values we have:

Posterior probability = [0.15 * 0.8] / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2]

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.36.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the base rate of tall attackers, is approximately 0.36.
