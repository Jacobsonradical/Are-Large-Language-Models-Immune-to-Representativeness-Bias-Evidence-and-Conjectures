To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability and the witness's testimony.

The prior probability is given by the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. However, we also have a witness who claims to have identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes mistakes in 20% of the cases.

To compute the posterior probability (the probability after considering the witness's testimony), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Height | Witness) = [P(Witness | Height) * P(Height)] / P(Witness)

Here, P(Height) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), P(Witness | Height) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually that height (0.80), and P(Witness) is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the actual height.

Since we don't have information about the total number of attackers and the number of times the witness has made a correct or incorrect identification, we can't compute P(Witness) directly. However, we can still use the given information to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Height | Witness) = [0.80 * 0.15] / P(Witness)

To estimate P(Witness), we can consider the false positive rate (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller). Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and the witness is wrong 20% of the time, the false positive rate is:

False Positive Rate = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

Now, we can estimate P(Witness) as the sum of the probability that the witness is correct about an attacker being 185 cm or taller and the false positive rate:

P(Witness) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.257

Finally, we can compute the posterior probability:

P(Height | Witness) = [0.80 * 0.15] / 0.257 â‰ˆ 0.467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.467.
