To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of attackers' heights.

1. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that there's an 80% chance the witness was correct when they identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

2. The base rate of attackers' heights: We know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that even before considering the witness's testimony, there's a lower likelihood that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so (our desired probability).
- P(B|A) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is (80% or 0.8).
- P(A) is the base rate probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- P(B) is the total probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the truth (since the population is roughly equal, this is 0.5).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24 / 0.5 = 0.48

So, based on the witness's testimony and the base rate of attackers' heights, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48.

{probability: 0.48}
