To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying height (information "a") and the prevalence of attackers of different heights in the population (information "b").

First, let's consider the witness's ability to judge height. Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, we can calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) for the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

LR = (Probability of witness saying 185 cm or taller given attacker is 185 cm or taller) / (Probability of witness saying 185 cm or taller given attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

LR = (0.8) / (0.2) = 4

This means that the witness's testimony is four times more likely if the attacker is 185 cm or taller than if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Next, we need to consider the base rate of attackers of different heights in the population. Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the prior odds of an attacker being 185 cm or taller:

Prior odds = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Prior odds = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.1765

Now, we can combine the likelihood ratio and the prior odds using Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

Posterior odds = Prior odds * LR

Posterior odds = 0.1765 * 4 ≈ 0.706

Finally, we can convert the posterior odds to a probability using the following formula:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) = 0.706 / (1 + 0.706) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.

Answer: {probability: 0.414}
