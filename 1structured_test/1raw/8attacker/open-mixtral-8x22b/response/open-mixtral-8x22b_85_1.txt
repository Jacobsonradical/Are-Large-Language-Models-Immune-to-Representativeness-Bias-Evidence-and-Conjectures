To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs in light of new evidence.

First, let's define our events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Our goal is to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker, i.e., the witness identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

To find P(~A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can use the complement rule:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we can substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41379.
