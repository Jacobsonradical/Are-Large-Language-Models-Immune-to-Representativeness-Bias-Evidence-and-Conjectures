To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the witness's accuracy in identifying height with the base rate of attackers' heights.

From the given information, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are mistaken.

However, the base rate of attackers' heights shows that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that even if the witness's identification was random, there would still be a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are, is 0.8 (80%). We also know that P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This states that P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(B|~A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not, is 0.2 (20%). We also know that P(~A), the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, is 0.85 (85%).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
