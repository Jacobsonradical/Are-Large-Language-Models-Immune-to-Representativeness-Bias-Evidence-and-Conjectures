To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote the events as follows:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:

P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. (From information b)
P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. (From information a)

We also need to consider the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, they are incorrect 20% of the time.

P(B|~A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2. (From information a)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know that P(~A) (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85 (from information b).

Now we can substitute the values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.

Formatted answer:
{probability: 0.41}
