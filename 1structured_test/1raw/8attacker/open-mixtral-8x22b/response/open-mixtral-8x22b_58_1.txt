To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which lets us update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15%), and the new evidence is the witness identification.

Let's denote:
- Event A: the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

The prior probability P(A) is the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (0.15).

The likelihood P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller (0.80).

The likelihood P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter (0.20).

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2857

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is approximately 0.2857.
