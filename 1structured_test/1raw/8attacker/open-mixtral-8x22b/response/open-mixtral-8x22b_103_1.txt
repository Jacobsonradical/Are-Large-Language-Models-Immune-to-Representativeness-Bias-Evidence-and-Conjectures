To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the general distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

Next, let's consider the general distribution of attacker heights. We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that if we were to guess the height of an attacker without any other information, we would estimate a 15% chance that they are 185 cm or taller.

However, we have additional information from the witness. To combine this information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem tells us that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B|A) is the witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8. We know that P(A) is the general probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct (which has a probability of 0.8 * 0.15), and the cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness is incorrect (which has a probability of 0.2 * 0.85).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41379

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
