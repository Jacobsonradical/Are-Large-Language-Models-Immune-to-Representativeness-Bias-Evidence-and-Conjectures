To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the general distribution of heights among attackers.

From the information given, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. However, we don't know if this error rate is consistent for both groups (people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller). For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the error rate is equally distributed between the two groups. This means that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 10% of the time (half of the 20% error rate) and incorrectly identifies someone as being shorter than 185 cm 10% of the time.

Now, considering the population distribution of attacker heights, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. However, the witness identified this attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = [P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm)] / P(Witness Identification)

The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller (P(Witness Identification | Height ≥ 185 cm)) is 90% (80% correct identification + 10% incorrect identification from the shorter group).

The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (P(Height ≥ 185 cm)) is 15%.

The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (P(Witness Identification)) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a tall person and incorrectly identifying a short person as tall: P(Witness Identification) = 0.9 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = (0.9 * 0.15) / (0.9 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85)

Solving this equation, we find that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.62.

Therefore, the estimated probability is:
