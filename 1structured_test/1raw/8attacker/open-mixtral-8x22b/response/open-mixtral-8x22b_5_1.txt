To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

A = The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Our prior probability P(A) is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller without any witness information. According to the information given, this is 15%.

Our likelihood P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 80%.

Now, we need to calculate P(B|~A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, and assuming the errors are equally likely to be overestimating or underestimating the height, the probability of overestimating is 10%.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85%.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.10 * 0.85] = 0.684

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.684 or 68.4%.
