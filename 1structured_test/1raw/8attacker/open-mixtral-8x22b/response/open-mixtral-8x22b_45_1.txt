To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, times the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B. In this case, we are looking for the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified the attacker as such (B).

First, let's denote the events as follows:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, based on the fact that only 15% of attackers fall into this height category.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% (based on the witness's accuracy in identifying height).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller, is 20% (based on the witness's error rate).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's identification and the given information, is approximately 0.4138.
