To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's accuracy and the general distribution of heights among attackers.

From the first piece of information (a), we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that if the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

From the second piece of information (b), we know that even though the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm. This means that if we were to pick an attacker at random, there's only a 15% chance they would be 185 cm or taller.

However, since we have the witness's testimony, we need to adjust this general probability based on the witness's accuracy. We can do this by multiplying the prior probability (15%) by the witness's accuracy (80%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller would be:

0.15 (prior probability) * 0.80 (witness accuracy) = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.12.
