To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and apply Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given event B is equal to the probability of event B given event A, multiplied by the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

Let's define events A and B:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5
P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1
P(B) = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.4

However, we also know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information modifies the prior probability P(A) to 0.15.

So, we recalculate P(A|B) using the updated P(A):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12.
