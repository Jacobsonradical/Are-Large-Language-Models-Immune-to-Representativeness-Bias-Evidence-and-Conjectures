To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's ability to correctly identify height and the distribution of attackers' heights in the population.

1. Witness's ability to judge height:
The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

2. Distribution of attackers' heights:
In the population, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information can be used to adjust the witness's accuracy using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the distribution of attackers' heights in the population (15% for 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness's testimony (80% accurate).

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attackers' heights, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
