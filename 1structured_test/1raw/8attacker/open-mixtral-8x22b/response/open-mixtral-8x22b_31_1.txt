To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided: the witness's accuracy in judging height and the general distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness's error would tend towards identifying someone as shorter or taller than they actually are. For the sake of this analysis, let's assume that the errors are evenly distributed, meaning that 10% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter, and 10% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies a person as taller.

Given this assumption, if the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that this identification is correct and a 10% chance that the witness made an error by identifying a shorter person as taller. This gives us a combined probability of 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9, or 90%, that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, based solely on the witness's testimony.

However, we also need to consider the general distribution of attacker heights, which states that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, before considering the witness's testimony.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (the probability after considering the witness's testimony) is equal to the prior probability (the probability before considering the witness's testimony) multiplied by the likelihood (the probability of the witness's testimony given the actual height of the attacker), divided by the normalizing constant (the sum of the products of the prior probabilities and the likelihoods for all possible heights).

In this case, we only have two possible heights: shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. The likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.1 (the probability of the witness making an error and identifying a shorter person as taller), and the likelihood given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the probability of the witness correctly identifying a taller person).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

0.15 (prior probability) * 0.8 (likelihood) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.1) = 0.577

So, considering both the witness's testimony and the general distribution of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.577.
