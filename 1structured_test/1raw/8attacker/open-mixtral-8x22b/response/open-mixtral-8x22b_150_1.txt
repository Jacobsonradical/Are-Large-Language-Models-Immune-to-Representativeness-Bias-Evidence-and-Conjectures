To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the actual distribution of heights among attackers.

From the witness's accuracy, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. However, this is under conditions similar to the night of the attack, not necessarily during the attack. Therefore, we can't directly use this probability without considering the actual distribution of heights among attackers.

From the actual distribution of heights among attackers, we know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability of the attacker's height.

Now, to estimate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have the exact likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker's actual height, we can't compute the exact posterior probability.

But we can make an approximation. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is the same regardless of the attacker's actual height, then the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification would be the product of the prior probability (0.15) and the witness's accuracy (0.8). This gives us 0.12 or 12%.

However, this is a simplification and the actual probability could be higher or lower depending on the witness's accuracy in identifying taller individuals specifically. Therefore, a more conservative estimate might be to use only the prior probability, which would give us 15% or 0.15.

Here are the estimates:

{probability: 0.12} or {probability: 0.15}
