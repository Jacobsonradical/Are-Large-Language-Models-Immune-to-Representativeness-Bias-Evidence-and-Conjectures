To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given.

Firstly, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct and a 20% chance that the witness is wrong.

Secondly, we know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability before the witness made the identification.

To find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since the witness's accuracy is independent of the actual height distribution of attackers, we can simplify the calculation by considering the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is a weighted average of the prior probability and the witness's accuracy. This can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness correct) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness incorrect) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

Substituting the given values:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.29.

{probability: 0.29}
