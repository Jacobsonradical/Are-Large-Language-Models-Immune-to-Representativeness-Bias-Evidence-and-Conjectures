To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given.

From information "a", we know that the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller. This means that if the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct, and a 20% chance they are mistaken.

From information "b", we know that in the population of potential attackers, 85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that if we randomly select an attacker, there is a 15% chance they are 185 cm or taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (15%) with new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height)

Using the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the sum of the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.413793103

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
