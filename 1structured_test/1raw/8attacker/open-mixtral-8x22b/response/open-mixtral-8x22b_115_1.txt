To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem to combine them.

From information (a), we know that the witness was able to correctly identify height 80% of the time and erred 20% of the time. This means that the witness's ability to correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller has a likelihood ratio (LR) of 0.8/0.2 = 4. In other words, the witness is four times more likely to correctly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller than to make an error.

From information (b), we know that the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, while the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification as follows:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = [P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness identification | 185 cm or taller) \* P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness identification | shorter than 185 cm) \* P(shorter than 185 cm)]

Substituting the values we have for the likelihood ratios and prior probabilities, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Solving for the probability, we get:

P(185 cm or taller | witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.42

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.42.

Answer: {probability: 0.42}
