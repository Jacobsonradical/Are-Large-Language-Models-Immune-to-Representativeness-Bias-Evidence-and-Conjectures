To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the prior probability based on the attacker population.

1. Witness accuracy:
The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time. When the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct, and a 20% chance that they made a mistake.

2. Prior probability based on the attacker population:
Given that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the witness's accuracy and the prior probability. We can use Bayes' theorem to do this:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = [P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm)

Assuming that the witness's accuracy is independent of the attacker's height:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Now, let's calculate the probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
