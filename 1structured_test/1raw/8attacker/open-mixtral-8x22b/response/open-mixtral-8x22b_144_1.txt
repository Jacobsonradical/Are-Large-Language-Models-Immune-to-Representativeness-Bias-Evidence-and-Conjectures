To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in judging height (information "a") and the prior probability based on the population statistics (information "b").

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are incorrect.

Next, let's consider the prior probability based on the population statistics. According to the provided information, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that, prior to any witness testimony, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E). We know that P(E|H) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller) is 0.80, P(H) (the prior probability) is 0.15, and P(E) (the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height) is 0.50 (since the population is evenly split between those shorter and taller than 185 cm).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.50 = 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24.
