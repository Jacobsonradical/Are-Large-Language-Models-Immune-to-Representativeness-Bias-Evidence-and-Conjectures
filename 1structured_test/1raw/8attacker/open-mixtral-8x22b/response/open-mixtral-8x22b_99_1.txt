To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information from both points "a" and "b".

First, let's consider point "a". It states that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Now let's consider point "b". A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%. This means that there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct when they identify someone as 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance that they are wrong.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood. In this case, the prior probability is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (0.15), and the likelihood is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.80).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability) \* (Likelihood) / (Prior probability \* Likelihood + (1 - Prior probability) \* (1 - Likelihood))

Substituting the values from points "a" and "b" into this equation, we get:

Posterior probability = (0.15) \* (0.80) / ((0.15) \* (0.80) + (1 - 0.15) \* (1 - 0.80))

Posterior probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.7 \* 0.2)

Posterior probability = 0.12 / 0.22

Posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.

Answer: {probability: 0.545}
