To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. In this case, we are interested in the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (A) given that the witness identified them as such (W).

First, let's define the probabilities we know:
P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, P(A) = 0.15.
P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the population is roughly equal, P(¬A) = 0.85.
P(W|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they indeed are. From the given information, P(W|A) = 0.8.
P(W|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(W|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we want to find P(A|W): The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Substituting the known values:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives:
P(A|W) ≈ 0.43

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.43.
