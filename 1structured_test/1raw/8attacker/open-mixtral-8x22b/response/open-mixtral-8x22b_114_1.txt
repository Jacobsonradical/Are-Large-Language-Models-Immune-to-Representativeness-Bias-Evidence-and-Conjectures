To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and how they affect each other.

First, from information (a), we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability based on the general population of attackers.

Next, from information (b), we learn that a witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate and a 20% error rate. This gives us the likelihood of the witness's identification being correct or incorrect.

To find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identification)

P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. In this case, it is 80%, or 0.8.

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%, or 0.15.

P(Witness Identification) is the overall probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by considering the probability of the witness identifying a shorter attacker as tall (false positive) and the probability of the witness identifying a tall attacker as tall (true positive):

P(Witness Identification) = P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm) + P(Witness Identification | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)

P(Witness Identification | Attacker < 185 cm) is the likelihood of the witness misidentifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the error rate, or 20%, or 0.2.

P(Attacker < 185 cm) is the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%, or 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(Witness Identification):

P(Witness Identification) = (0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the posterior probability, P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification):

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identification) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.41, or 41%.
