To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in judging height and the general distribution of attacker heights.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. We'll denote the event that the witness is correct as "C" and the event that the witness is incorrect as "I".

Now, let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as "A" and the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as "S".

Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is P(A) = 0.5. Similarly, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is P(S) = 0.5.

However, we are given that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This gives us updated probabilities of P(A) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85.

Now, let's consider the witness's statement. The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can denote this as "W". We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|S) * P(S)]

We know that P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy for tall people) and P(W|S) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate for short people).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives us P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.36.

So, given the witness statement and the general distribution of attacker heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.

Answer: {probability: 0.36}
