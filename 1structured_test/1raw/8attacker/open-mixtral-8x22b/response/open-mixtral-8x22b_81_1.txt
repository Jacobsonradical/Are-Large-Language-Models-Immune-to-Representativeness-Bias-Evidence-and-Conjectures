To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Since P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm) and the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, we have:

P(B|~A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
