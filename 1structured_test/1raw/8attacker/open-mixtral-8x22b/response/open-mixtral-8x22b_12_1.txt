To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the distribution of attacker heights in the population.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance that the witness is mistaken.

Next, let's consider the distribution of attacker heights in the population. According to the information given, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that, without any witness testimony, the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony) is proportional to the product of the prior probability of the event and the likelihood of the evidence (the witness's testimony) given the event. In this case, the likelihood of the evidence given the event is 80%, and the prior probability of the event is 15%.

So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is proportional to (0.15 * 0.80). To find the actual posterior probability, we would need to divide this by the sum of (prior probability of the event * likelihood of the evidence given the event) and (prior probability of the complementary event * likelihood of the evidence given the complementary event). However, since the witness's accuracy is the same for both people who are 185 cm or taller and people who are shorter, this simplifies to just dividing by 1.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
