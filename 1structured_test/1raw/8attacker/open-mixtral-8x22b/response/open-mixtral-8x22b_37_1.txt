To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H as the event that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- W as the event that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- A as the event that a person is an attacker.

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:
- P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm or taller and those shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size).
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- P(not A|H) = 0.85 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
- P(not A|not H) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm).

We want to find P(H|W and A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such and that the person is an attacker.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W and A) = P(W and A|H) * P(H) / P(W and A)

We can decompose P(W and A|H) as:

P(W and A|H) = P(W|A and H) * P(A|H)

Since we are given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can assume P(W|A and H) to be 1. Also, given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A|H) is 0.15.

Now we can calculate:

P(H|W and A) = (1 * 0.15 * 0.5) / P(W and A)

To find P(W and A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W and A) = P(W and A|H) * P(H) + P(W and A|not H) * P(not H)

Since P(W and A|not H) is not given, we can use the information about the witness's accuracy for people shorter than 185 cm:

P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We know that P(not H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size to those 185 cm or taller).

Now we can find P(W and A|not H):

P(W and A|not H) = P(W|not H) * P(A|not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now we can calculate P(W and A):

P(W and A) = (1 * 0.15 * 0.5) + (0.17 * 0.5)

Finally, we can find P(H|W and A):

P(H|W and A) = (1 * 0.15 * 0.5) / [(1 * 0.15 * 0.5) + (0.17 * 0.5)] â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.47.
