To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to take into account both pieces of information and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know the following probabilities:
P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
P(not A): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Substitute the known values:
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Now, calculate the value:
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.413793

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.413793 or 41.38%.

In the given format:
{probability: 0.413793}
