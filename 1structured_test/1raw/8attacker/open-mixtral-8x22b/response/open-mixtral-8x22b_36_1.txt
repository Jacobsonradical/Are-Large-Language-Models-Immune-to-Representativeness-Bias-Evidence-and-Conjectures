To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:

- P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.80.
- To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the actual height, we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm (not A), P(not A) is 85% or 0.85. And since the witness is correct 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time:

P(B|not A) = 20% or 0.20

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
