Based on the information provided, we have two factors to consider: the witness's accuracy in judging height and the population distribution of attacker heights.

1. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time. However, we don't know if the witness was correct in this specific instance. So, we can't directly apply the 80% accuracy to this case.

2. The population distribution of attacker heights: Even though the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, the distribution of attacker heights is not. 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given this, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller would be based on the distribution of attacker heights, not the witness's accuracy, because the witness's accuracy doesn't tell us if they were correct in this specific case.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.15}
