To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we should consider both the witness's ability to correctly identify height and the prior probability of an attacker being of that height.

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:

1. The witness's accuracy:
   - P(Correct) = 0.8
   - P(Error) = 0.2

2. The prior probability of an attacker's height:
   - P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85
   - P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm)

We know that P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy), and P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller).

To find P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm) + P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)

Since P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) is the probability of the witness making an error, we have:

P(Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the desired probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness Identified ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is approximately 0.4138.
