To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy in judging height and the population distribution of attacker heights.

1. The witness's accuracy: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

2. Population distribution of attacker heights: 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that if the witness were to make a random guess, they would be more likely to be wrong (guessing the attacker is taller than 185 cm) than right (guessing the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred is equal to the probability of event B given that event A has occurred, times the probability of event A, divided by the probability of event B.

In this case:
A = The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B = The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

So, we need to calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (the population distribution of attacker heights)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

P(~A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, given the witness's identification and the population distribution of attacker heights, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
