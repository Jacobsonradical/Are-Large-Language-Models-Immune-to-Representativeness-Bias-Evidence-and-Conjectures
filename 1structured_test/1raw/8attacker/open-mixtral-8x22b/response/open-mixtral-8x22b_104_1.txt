To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the general population and the distribution of attacker heights:

P(A) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075

Next, let's calculate the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(B|A) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the marginal likelihood P(B), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. To do this, we need to consider both the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller (even if they are not), and the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being shorter than 185 cm (when they are actually 185 cm or taller):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.075 + 0.2 * 0.925 = 0.22

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.075 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.2727

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2727.
