To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that:

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|H) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, P(not H) = 0.85. The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time (P(W|not H) = 0.20). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(W) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
