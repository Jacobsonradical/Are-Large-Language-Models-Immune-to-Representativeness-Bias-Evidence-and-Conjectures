To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the witness's ability to correctly identify height and the distribution of attacker heights in the population.

From information (a), we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they were correct and a 20% chance that they were mistaken.

From information (b), we know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, this information alone does not directly apply to the current case, as the witness has already identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we need to consider the witness's accuracy in our calculation.

Let's denote:
- P(C) as the probability that the witness is correct
- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(~T) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We know that P(C) = 0.8 and P(~T) = 0.85.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|C) = P(C|T) * P(T) / [P(C|T) * P(T) + P(C|~T) * P(~T)]

Since the witness's accuracy doesn't depend on the actual height of the attacker, we can assume that P(C|T) = P(C) = 0.8 and P(C|~T) = 1 - P(C) = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(T|C) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
