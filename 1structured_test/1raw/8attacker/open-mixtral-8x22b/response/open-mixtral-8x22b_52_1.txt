To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness's accuracy and the prior probability of an attacker's height.

1. Witness Accuracy: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. Thus, the probability of the witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of the witness being wrong is 0.2.

2. Prior Probability: According to the information given, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness claim) = P(Witness claim | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness claim)

We know the following probabilities:
- P(Witness claim | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy)
- P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (the prior probability)

However, we don't know the P(Witness claim) directly, but we can calculate it as follows:

P(Witness claim) = P(Witness claim | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness claim | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

- P(Witness claim | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
- P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from the prior probability)
- P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (since there's an 85% chance the attacker is under 185 cm)

Now, P(Witness claim | Attacker < 185 cm) would be the probability of the witness making an error (since the witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller, but the attacker is actually shorter). So, P(Witness claim | Attacker < 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(Witness claim):

P(Witness claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is approximately 0.41.
