To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rates of attackers' heights.

First, let's look at the witness's accuracy. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. This means that if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness identified them correctly. However, there is also a 20% chance that the witness was wrong, and the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

Next, let's consider the base rates of attackers' heights. According to the information provided, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that, in general, an attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm than taller.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs (the base rates) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony)
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) is the prior probability of B (the probability that the witness identifies a random attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Calculating this gives us a probability of approximately 0.31.

Therefore, based on the witness's testimony and the base rates of attackers' heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.31 (or 31%).
