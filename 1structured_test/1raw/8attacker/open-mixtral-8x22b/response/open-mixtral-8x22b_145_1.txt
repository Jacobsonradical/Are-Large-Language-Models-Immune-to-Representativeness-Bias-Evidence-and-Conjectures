To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information given: the base rates of attackers' height and the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

First, let's consider the base rates. According to the information given, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and made errors 20% of the time. This means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are wrong.

To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = [P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / [P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm)]

We know that P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% accuracy), P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% base rate), and we need to find P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm).

P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

We know that P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% error rate), and P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% base rate).

So, P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.41.
