To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rates of attacker heights in the population and the accuracy of the witness's identification.

First, let's consider the base rates:
- 85% of attackers are under 185 cm
- 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller

Now, let's consider the witness's identification ability:
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time
- The witness makes an error 20% of the time

Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that this identification is correct. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15%), and the new evidence is the witness's identification as such (with 80% accuracy and 20% error rate).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [P(Witness identification | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness identification)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identification) â‰ˆ 0.46 or 46%

Therefore, given the evidence and the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 46%.
