To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability (a) and the witness testimony (b).

First, let's consider the prior probability (a):
- The population is equally split between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
- However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

This information gives us a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness testimony (b):
- The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability given the witness testimony. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

P(A) is our prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This is calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Since ~A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(~A) = 0.85.

P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (the error rate).

So,
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony is approximately 0.48.
