To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is useful in situations where we want to update our belief in a hypothesis given some observed evidence. In this case, our hypothesis H is that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and our evidence E is the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, P(H|E), is equal to the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(H), times the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H), divided by the prior probability of the evidence, P(E):

P(H|E) = P(H) * P(E|H) / P(E)

Let's calculate each of these probabilities:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

P(H) = 0.15

2. P(E|H): This is the probability that the witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.

P(E|H) = 0.8

3. P(E): This is the probability of the evidence, regardless of the attacker's height. To find this, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is incorrect. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller and half is shorter, and given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, we can calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|¬H) * P(¬H)

P(E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5

P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1

P(E) = 0.5

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(H) * P(E|H) / P(E)

P(H|E) = 0.15 * 0.8 / 0.5

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.5

P(H|E) = 0.24

So, given the witness's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.24. However, this calculation assumes that the witness's ability to identify height is independent of the attacker's height, which might not be the case in reality.
