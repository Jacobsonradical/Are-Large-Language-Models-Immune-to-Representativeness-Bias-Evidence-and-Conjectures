To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior information about attacker heights and the witness's testimony.

First, let's consider the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, without considering the witness's testimony. According to the information given, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness's testimony. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, we know that the witness makes errors in 20% of cases. This means that when the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are incorrect.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability is proportional to the prior probability times the likelihood of the witness's testimony, given the attacker's height.

The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 0.80 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). The likelihood of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20 (since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness testimony) = P(witness testimony | attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(witness testimony)

P(witness testimony | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.80 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
P(witness testimony) = P(witness testimony | attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness testimony | attacker < 185 cm) \* P(attacker < 185 cm)

P(witness testimony | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.20 (the witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)

P(witness testimony) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.23

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness testimony) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.23 = 0.52

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.52 or 52%.
