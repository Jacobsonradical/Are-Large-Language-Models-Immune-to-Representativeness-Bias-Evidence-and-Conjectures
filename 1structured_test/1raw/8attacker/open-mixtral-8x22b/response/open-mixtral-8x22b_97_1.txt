To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the witness's accuracy with the general population statistics and the specific statistics about attackers.

First, let's consider the witness's accuracy. If the witness is 80% accurate, that means they correctly identify someone's height in 4 out of 5 cases. In other words, if the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct.

Next, let's consider the general population statistics. According to the information provided, the population is split roughly equally between people under 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller. This means that without any other information, the probability of someone being 185 cm or taller would be approximately 0.5 (or 50%).

However, we also have specific statistics about attackers. According to these statistics, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This significantly reduces the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update probabilities based on new evidence. However, in this case, we don't have enough information to use Bayes' theorem directly. Instead, we can use a simplified approach to estimate the probability.

Given that the witness is 80% accurate and that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we might be tempted to simply multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability. However, this would not be correct because the witness's accuracy and the population statistics are not independent.

Instead, we can think of the witness's identification as a test with a certain sensitivity (80%) and specificity (also 80%, since the witness is equally accurate in both directions). The sensitivity of a test is the probability that it correctly identifies someone with the condition (in this case, being 185 cm or taller), and the specificity is the probability that it correctly identifies someone without the condition.

Given this, we can estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of the witness's identification, which is the probability that someone identified by the witness as being 185 cm or taller actually is 185 cm or taller. The PPV can be estimated using the following formula:

PPV = (sensitivity * prevalence) / ((sensitivity * prevalence) + ((1 - specificity) * (1 - prevalence)))

Here, the prevalence is the probability that a randomly selected attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

PPV = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + ((1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15))) = 0.35

So, based on this calculation, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.35, or 35%. However, this is a rough estimate and the actual probability could be different depending on various factors not considered here, such as the distribution of heights among attackers and the exact nature of the witness's accuracy.
