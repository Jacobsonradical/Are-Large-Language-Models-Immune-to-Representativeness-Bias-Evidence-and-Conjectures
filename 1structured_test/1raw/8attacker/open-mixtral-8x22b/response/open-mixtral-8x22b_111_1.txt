To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability of an attacker being that height and the reliability of the witness's identification.

The prior probability is given by the information that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

For the witness's identification, the witness is correct 80% of the time. However, since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we are interested in the specific scenario where the witness is correct about identifying a tall person.

Given that the witness is equally likely to encounter a person who is shorter or taller than 185 cm, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person is half of the overall correct identification rate (which includes both tall and short people), because the witness's errors are equally likely to be false positives (identifying a short person as tall) or false negatives (identifying a tall person as short). Therefore, the witness is correct about identifying a tall person 40% of the time (half of 80%).

To find the combined probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identified them as such, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, in this case, we can simplify the calculation by considering the witness's accuracy as a modifier to the prior probability. Since the witness is correct 40% of the time about identifying a tall person, the modified probability that the attacker was tall and correctly identified as such is:

0.15 (prior probability) * 0.4 (witness accuracy for tall people) = 0.06

However, this is not the final probability we are looking for, because the witness could also have incorrectly identified a shorter person as tall. To find the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification, we need to consider both the cases where the witness was correct and where the witness was incorrect but the attacker was still tall.

Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, 10% of the time they will incorrectly identify a short person as tall (half of the overall error rate, since errors are equally likely to go in either direction). Therefore, the probability that the attacker was tall given the witness's identification is:

0.06 (probability of witness being correct about a tall person) + 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker was tall) * 0.1 (probability that the witness incorrectly identified a short person as tall) = 0.06 + 0.015 = 0.075

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.075}
