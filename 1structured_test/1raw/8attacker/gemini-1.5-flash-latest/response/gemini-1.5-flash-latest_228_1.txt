Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is roughly split evenly between people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%). 
* **Information b:**  A witness claims the attacker was taller than 185 cm. We know the witness's accuracy under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as taller given they are actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability that the attacker is taller. This is the proportion of the population that's taller, which is approximately 0.5 (since the population is roughly split).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    * Where ¬A means the attacker is *not* taller (shorter).
    * P(B|¬A) is the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller (20% or 0.2).
    * P(¬A) is the prior probability the attacker is shorter, approximately 0.5.

**Calculation**

1. Calculate P(B):
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

2. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Interpretation**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%. This is higher than the initial 50% probability, but it's still not conclusive. The witness's testimony, while helpful, doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of the attacker being shorter.
