Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is roughly split in half by height (185 cm as the dividing point). However, attackers are disproportionately shorter. 
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but it's important to note that their accuracy is *not* specific to attackers, just people in general.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Prior Probability:** Based on information "a", the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (because 15% of attackers are in that height range).

2. **Witness Evidence:** The witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  This evidence is not perfect, as the witness is correct only 80% of the time. 

3. **Combining Information:**  We need to combine the prior probability (15%) with the witness's accuracy (80%).  We don't know the specific probability of the witness *correctly* identifying someone taller than 185 cm, but we can use the witness's general accuracy as a guide. 

**Estimation:**

Since the witness is right 80% of the time, we can make a rough estimate that the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness's testimony is *somewhat* higher than the original 15%.

**However, we cannot calculate a precise probability without more information.**  We need to know the witness's accuracy specifically for identifying people taller than 185 cm, which is different from their overall accuracy. 

**Conclusion:**

{probability: We cannot provide a precise number without more information.  The probability is likely somewhat higher than 15% but less than 80%.}
