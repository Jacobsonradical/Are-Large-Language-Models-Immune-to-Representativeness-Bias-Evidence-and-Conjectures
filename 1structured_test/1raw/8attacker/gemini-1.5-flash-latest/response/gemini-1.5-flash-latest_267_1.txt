Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable, correctly identifying height 80% of the time. However, there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:** While the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to consider both the witness's testimony and the general attacker profile:

1. **Probability of Witness Being Correct:**  The witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  They are correct 80% of the time, so there's an 80% chance their statement is accurate.

2. **Probability of Attacker Being Tall Given Witness Statement:**  We know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. If the witness is correct, the attacker is in this 15% group.

3. **Probability of Attacker Being Tall Given Witness Error:** If the witness is incorrect, the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.  Since the population is evenly split, there's a 50% chance the attacker is in this group.

**Combining the Information:**

We use Bayes' Theorem to combine these probabilities:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):**  Probability of the attacker being tall given the witness says so.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):**  Probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall, given they actually are tall (80% from information a).
* **P(Attacker Tall):**  Prior probability of an attacker being tall (15% from information b).
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short):**  Probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall, given they actually are short (20% from information a).
* **P(Attacker Short):**  Prior probability of an attacker being short (85% from information b).

Bayes' Theorem:
```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]
```

Plugging in the values:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] 
                                         = 0.12 / 0.3
                                         = 0.4
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
