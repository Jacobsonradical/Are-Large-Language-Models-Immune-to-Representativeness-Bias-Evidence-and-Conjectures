Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the general population is split evenly.

**Calculations**

1. **Witness Accuracy:**  The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Since they are correct 80% of the time, there's an 80% chance they are correct in this instance.

2. **Population Distribution:**  The population is split evenly between people shorter and taller than 185 cm.

3. **Attacker Distribution:**  85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Combining the Information**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers.

* **Scenario 1: Witness is Correct:**  If the witness is correct about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, there's a 15% chance this is true based on the distribution of attackers.

* **Scenario 2: Witness is Incorrect:** If the witness is incorrect, the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This has a 20% chance of happening (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time).

**Probability Calculation**

To get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we weigh each scenario by its likelihood:

* **Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is correct) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12**
* **Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness is incorrect) = 0.20 * 0 = 0** (The probability is 0 because if the witness is wrong, the attacker cannot be 185 cm or taller)

**Final Calculation:**

Add the probabilities of each scenario: 0.12 + 0 = 0.12

**Answer:** {probability: 0.12}
