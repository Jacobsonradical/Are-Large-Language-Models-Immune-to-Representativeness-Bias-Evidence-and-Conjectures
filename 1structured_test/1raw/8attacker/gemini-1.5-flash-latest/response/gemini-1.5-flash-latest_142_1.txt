Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

Where:

* P(B|A): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. (This is what we want to find)
* P(A|B): Probability the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they actually were. (This is the witness's accuracy: 80%)
* P(B): Prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller. (This is the base population proportion: 15%)
* P(A): Probability the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of actual height).  We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(A):**

We can use the law of total probability to find P(A):

* P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)

  * P(A|B) = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
  * P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller)
  * P(A|not B) = 0.20 (witness error rate)
  * P(not B) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Therefore, P(A) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|A) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
