Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. This is important because it tells us the base rate of attackers being taller than 185 cm is 15%.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker Taller | Witness Says Taller) = [P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller) * P(Attacker Taller)] / P(Witness Says Taller)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller):** This is the probability the witness says someone is taller than 185 cm given that they actually are. From information a, this is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(Attacker Taller):** This is the base rate probability that an attacker is taller than 185 cm, which is 15% or 0.15 from information b.
* **P(Witness Says Taller):** This is the overall probability that the witness will say the attacker is taller than 185 cm. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness Says Taller) = P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller) * P(Attacker Taller) + P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Shorter) * P(Attacker Shorter)
    * P(Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Putting it Together:**

P(Attacker Taller | Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.43 or 43%.
