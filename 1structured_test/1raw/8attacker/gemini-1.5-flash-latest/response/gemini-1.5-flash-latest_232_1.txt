Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1.  Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief about an event (B) given new evidence (A):

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

Where:

* P(B|A): The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.  This is what we want to find.
* P(A|B): The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are. This is the witness' accuracy, 80%.
* P(B): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from the population statistics).
* P(A): The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(A):**

We can use the Law of Total Probability to find P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)

* P(A|B) = 0.8 (witness accuracy)
* P(B) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being tall)
* P(A|not B) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
* P(not B) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being short)

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**4.  Calculate P(B|A):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
