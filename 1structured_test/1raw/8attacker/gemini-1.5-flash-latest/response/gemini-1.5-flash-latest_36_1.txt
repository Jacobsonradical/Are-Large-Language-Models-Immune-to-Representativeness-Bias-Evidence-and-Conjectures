Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  A witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but this witness is not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.
* **Information b:**  While the population is roughly split 50/50 in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculations**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.**  The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This has a probability of 0.8 (80%) based on the witness's accuracy.
2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.** The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness mistakenly identified them as taller. 

To calculate the probability of Scenario 2, we need to consider the witness's error rate (20%) and the proportion of attackers who are actually shorter:

* Probability of witness error: 0.2 (20%)
* Proportion of attackers shorter than 185 cm: 0.85 (85%)
* Probability of Scenario 2: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

Now we have the probabilities of both scenarios:

* Scenario 1: 0.8 (attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* Scenario 2: 0.17 (attacker is shorter than 185 cm but witness is wrong)

To get the final probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relative likelihood of each scenario.  Since the population is roughly split 50/50, we can assume the scenarios are equally likely *before* considering the witness's testimony.

However, the witness's testimony strongly suggests Scenario 1 is more likely.  To account for this, we can use a weighted average:

* Weight for Scenario 1: 0.8
* Weight for Scenario 2: 0.17

**Final Probability:** (0.8 * 0.8) + (0.17 * 0.17) = 0.6729

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.6729}
