Here's how we can break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:** Tells us about the general population distribution and attack patterns. 
    * 50% of the population is under 185 cm, 50% is 185 cm or taller.
    * But, attackers are disproportionately shorter: 85% under 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller.
* **Fact b:** Introduces a witness and their reliability.
    * The witness is more likely to be correct, but they still have a 20% error rate.

**Combining the Information**

We need to consider both the witness's statement and the general attacker characteristics.

1. **Witness Reliability:** The witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  We know they are 80% accurate. This means there's an 80% chance they are telling the truth and a 20% chance they are wrong.

2. **Attacker Probability:**  Fact "a" tells us that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, based on the general attacker population.

**Calculating the Estimate**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information:

* **P(A|B):** Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given the person is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy: 0.8
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller: 0.15 (from Fact "a")
* **P(B):** Overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier to calculate directly, but we can use the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * Where:
        * P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter (0.2)
        * P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85)

**Putting it together:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.48.**
