Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable in judging height, but there's a chance of error.
* **Information b:**  Attackers under 185 cm are much more common than attackers 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

* Let  'T' be the event that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let 'A' be the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|T), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|T) = [P(T|A) * P(A)] / P(T)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(T|A):**  Probability of the witness testifying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% or 0.15 based on the population statistics.
* **P(T):** Overall probability of the witness testifying "tall". This requires a bit more work:

    * **P(T) = P(T|A) * P(A) + P(T|not A) * P(not A)**
    * **P(T|not A):** Probability of the witness testifying "tall" given the attacker is *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
    * **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker *not* being tall, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(T):**
   P(T) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(A|T):**
   P(A|T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer**

{probability: 0.46}

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.  Even though the witness is generally accurate, the fact that short attackers are much more common significantly affects the overall probability.
