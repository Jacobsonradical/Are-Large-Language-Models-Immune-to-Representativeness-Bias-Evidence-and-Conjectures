Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category. 
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem calls for Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probability (the probability of an event given that another event has occurred).

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall, given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of actual height).  This is a bit trickier and requires the Law of Total Probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall, given the attacker is *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, 20% (from information b).
* **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker *not* being tall, which is 85% (from information a).

**Putting it Together**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
