Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm even though the population is split evenly. This suggests the witness's testimony is important.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy rate in identifying height. We need to consider both correct identifications and errors.

**Calculations**

Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability:

* **P(A|B):** The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker *was* actually that height. This is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller:** This happens with a probability of 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (80% accuracy * 15% chance of being taller)
2. **Witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as taller:** This happens with a probability of 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate * 85% chance of being shorter)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
