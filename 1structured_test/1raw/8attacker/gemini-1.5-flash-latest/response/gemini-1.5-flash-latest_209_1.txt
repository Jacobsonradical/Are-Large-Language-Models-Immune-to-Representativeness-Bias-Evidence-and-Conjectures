Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a"**: This tells us the witness's reliability in identifying height. They are correct 80% of the time, but they are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Information "b"**: This tells us the distribution of attackers by height within the population.  While the overall population is evenly split, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A)**: The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information "a").
* **P(A)**: The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information "b").
* **P(B)**: The overall probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A)**: The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (from information "a").
* **P(not A)**: The prior probability that an attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is 85% (from information "b").

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we have all the components to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's identification and the attacker population distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
