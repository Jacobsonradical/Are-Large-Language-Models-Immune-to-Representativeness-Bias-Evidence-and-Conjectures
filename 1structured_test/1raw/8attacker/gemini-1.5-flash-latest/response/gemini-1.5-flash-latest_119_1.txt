Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:**  While the population is split evenly in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened 
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A 
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B

**Let's Define Our Events**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

**Calculating the Probabilities**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information b): 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from information a): 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are not (from information a): 0.20
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller (from information b): 0.85

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is done using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
