Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Let's break down the information:**

* **Fact 1:**  50% of the population is under 185 cm, and 50% is 185 cm or taller.
* **Fact 2:**  85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. They are 80% accurate in height identification.

**Reasoning:**

We need to consider both the probability of the witness being correct and the base probability of an attacker being tall.

1. **Probability of the witness being correct given the attacker is actually tall:** This is the witness's accuracy rate of 80% (0.8).

2. **Probability of the witness being incorrect given the attacker is actually short:** This is the witness's error rate of 20% (0.2).

3. **Prior probability of an attacker being tall:** This is 15% (0.15) based on the fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

4. **Prior probability of an attacker being short:** This is 85% (0.85) based on the fact that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Where:

* P(Tall | Witness) is the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.
* P(Witness | Tall) is the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are actually tall (0.8).
* P(Tall) is the prior probability of the attacker being tall (0.15).
* P(Witness) is the overall probability of the witness making their observation, which can be calculated as follows:

    P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short) 
    P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation:**

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Tall | Witness) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
