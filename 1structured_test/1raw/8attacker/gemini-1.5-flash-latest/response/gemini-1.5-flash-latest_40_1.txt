Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is reliable, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:**  The population is split evenly, but attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a way to update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's define:

* **P(T):**  Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (prior probability)
* **P(W):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* **P(W|T):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that tall (from information a, 80% or 0.8)
* **P(W|~T):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (from information a, 20% or 0.2)

We want to find **P(T|W):** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

**Calculating P(W):**

P(W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] + [P(W|~T) * P(~T)] 
      = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)  
      = 0.29

**Calculating P(T|W):**

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Explanation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138 or about 41.38%.
