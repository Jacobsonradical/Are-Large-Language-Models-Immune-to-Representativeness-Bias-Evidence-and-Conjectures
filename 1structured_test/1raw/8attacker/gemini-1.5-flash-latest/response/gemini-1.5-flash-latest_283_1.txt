Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.34
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353 
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.353.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.353}
