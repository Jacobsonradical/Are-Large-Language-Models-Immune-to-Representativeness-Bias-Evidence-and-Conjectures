Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know the witness's accuracy under similar conditions: 80% correct, 20% incorrect.
* **Information b:**  The population is roughly split in terms of height (50/50). However,  attackers are not evenly distributed by height: 85% are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem.  Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion of attackers with this height, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit more complex and requires considering both true positives (correctly identifying someone tall) and false positives (incorrectly identifying someone short).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **True Positive:** The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller), and the witness correctly identifies them (80% chance).
2. **False Positive:** The attacker is short (under 185 cm), and the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall (20% chance).

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
