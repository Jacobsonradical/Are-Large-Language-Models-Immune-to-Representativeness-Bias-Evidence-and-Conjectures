Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being short or tall.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.  In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% or 0.15 based on information "a".
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This requires considering both scenarios:
    * The attacker is tall, and the witness is correct (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
    * The attacker is short, and the witness is incorrect (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
