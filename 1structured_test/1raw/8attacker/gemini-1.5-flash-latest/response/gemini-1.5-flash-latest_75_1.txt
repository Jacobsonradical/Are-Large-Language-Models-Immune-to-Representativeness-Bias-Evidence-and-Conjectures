Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and how the attack distribution deviates from that. 
* **Information b:** Provides information about the witness's reliability in identifying height.

**Reasoning**

We need to combine the information about the population distribution of heights, the witness's reliability, and the fact that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's break it down:

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (based on information a).

2. **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually 185 cm or taller is 80% (based on information b).

3. **Likelihood of False Positive:** The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 20% (based on information b).

**Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)**

To calculate P(Witness Says Tall), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is tall, and the witness correctly identifies them.
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is short, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall.

**Calculations**

* P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) = 0.80 (from information b)
* P(Attacker Tall) = 0.15 (from information a)
* P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) = 0.20 (from information b)
* P(Attacker Short) = 0.85 (from information a)

**P(Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] + [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]**
                 = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
                 = 0.29

**P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29**
                                     = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
