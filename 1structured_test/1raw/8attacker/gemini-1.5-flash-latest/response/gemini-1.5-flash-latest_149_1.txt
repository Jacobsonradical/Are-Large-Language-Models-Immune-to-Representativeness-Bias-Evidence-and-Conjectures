Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**From the given information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (based on general population distribution).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (witness accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (witness error rate).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**Let's plug in the values:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
       = 0.12 / 0.30
       = 0.4
```

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.**

**{probability: 0.4}**
