Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good estimator of height, but they have a 20% error rate. This tells us about the witness's accuracy, but not necessarily about the attacker's actual height.
* **Information b:** This tells us the distribution of attackers in the population. While the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:

*  **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population distribution of attackers: 0.15.
* **P(W):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W| not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculation:**

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
