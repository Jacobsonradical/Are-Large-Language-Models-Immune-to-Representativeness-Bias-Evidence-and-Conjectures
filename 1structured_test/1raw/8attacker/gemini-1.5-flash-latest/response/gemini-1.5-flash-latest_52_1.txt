Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but they still make mistakes. We need to account for both correct identifications and errors.
* **Information b:**  This tells us about the overall distribution of attackers in the population.  Most attackers are shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is roughly split 50/50.

**Calculations:**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let W be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of attacker being under 185 cm)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
