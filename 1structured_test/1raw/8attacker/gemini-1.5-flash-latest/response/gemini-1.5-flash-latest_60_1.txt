Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact 1:**  The population is roughly split evenly between people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers are shorter, and 15% are taller.
* **Fact 2:**  A witness claims the attacker was taller than 185 cm. This witness is accurate 80% of the time, meaning they have a 20% chance of being wrong.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two possibilities:

1. **The witness is correct:** If the witness is correct, the attacker is indeed taller than 185 cm. The probability of this is 80% (the witness's accuracy).
2. **The witness is incorrect:** If the witness is wrong, the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this is 20% (the witness's error rate).

Now, we need to weigh these probabilities against the base rates of attackers being shorter or taller.

* **Scenario 1 (Witness correct):** 
    * Probability of witness being correct: 0.8
    * Probability of attacker being taller given witness is correct: 1 (certainty)
    * Combined probability: 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

* **Scenario 2 (Witness incorrect):**
    * Probability of witness being incorrect: 0.2
    * Probability of attacker being taller given witness is incorrect: 0 (impossible) 
    * Combined probability: 0.2 * 0 = 0

**Final Calculation**

To find the overall probability of the attacker being taller, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:

0.8 + 0 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
