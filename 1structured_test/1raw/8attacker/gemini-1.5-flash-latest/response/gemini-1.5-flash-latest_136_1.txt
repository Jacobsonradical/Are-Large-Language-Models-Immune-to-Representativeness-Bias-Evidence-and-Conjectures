Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly between those heights.
* **Information b:** This provides a measure of the witness's reliability in judging height.

**Calculations**

1. **Prior Probability:**  Since the population is split evenly, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

2. **Likelihood:** The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. So, the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are that height is 0.8.

3. **Conditional Probability:** We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. This is where Bayes' Theorem comes in:

   P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = [P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm)

   * We know P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (likelihood)
   * We know P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (prior probability)
   * We need to calculate P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm).

4. **Calculating P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm):** This requires considering both cases (attacker actually is ≥ 185 cm and attacker actually is < 185 cm) and weighting them by their probabilities:

   * **Case 1: Attacker ≥ 185 cm:**
      * P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8
      * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5
      * Contribution to P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

   * **Case 2: Attacker < 185 cm:**
      * P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness is wrong 20% of the time)
      * P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.5 
      * Contribution to P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

   * P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

5. **Putting it together:**

   P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
