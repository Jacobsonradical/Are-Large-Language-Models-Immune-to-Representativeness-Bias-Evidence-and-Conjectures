Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the relative frequency of attackers in each height group.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem lends itself well to Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker IS 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly split, this is 0.5 (50%).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, 0.2 (20%).
* **P(not A):**  Probability of the attacker NOT being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (50%).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we have all the pieces to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8}
