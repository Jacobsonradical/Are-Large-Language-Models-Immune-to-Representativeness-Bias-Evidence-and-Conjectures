Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness has a good ability to judge height, but they're not perfect. 
* **Information b:**  While the population is split evenly in height, attackers are more likely to be shorter.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information:

* **Let A be the event:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Let B be the event:**  The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall *given* they are actually tall.  This is 80% (from information a).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that an attacker is tall. This is 15% (from information b).
* **P(B):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
