Here's how we can break down the problem to arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information "a":** This tells us about the witness's accuracy in judging height. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, regardless of the actual height. 
* **Information "b":** This provides us with the base rate of attackers in each height category.  Even though the population is roughly split, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs 15%).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness):**  This is the probability we want to find â€“ the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement.
* **P(Witness | Tall):**  This is the probability the witness would identify someone as tall given they *are* actually tall. This is 80% (from information "a").
* **P(Tall):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (from information "b").
* **P(Witness):** This is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short) 
    * P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28  = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Conclusion**

Despite the witness identifying the attacker as tall, the probability that the attacker was actually tall is only about 43%. This is because the base rate of tall attackers is much lower than the base rate of short attackers.
