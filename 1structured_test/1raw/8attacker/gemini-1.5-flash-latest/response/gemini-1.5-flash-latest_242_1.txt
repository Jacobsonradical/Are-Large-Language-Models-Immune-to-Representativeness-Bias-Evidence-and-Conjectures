Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 in terms of height (shorter than 185 cm vs. taller than or equal to 185 cm). However, the attacker pool is skewed: 85% are shorter and 15% are taller.
* **Information b:**  The witness has a good but not perfect ability to judge height. They are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. 

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two possibilities:

1. **The witness is correct:**  The attacker is actually taller than 185 cm.
2. **The witness is wrong:** The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

**Let's calculate the probabilities of each possibility:**

* **Probability of the witness being correct:** 
    * This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8

* **Probability of the witness being wrong:**
    * This is 1 minus the witness's accuracy: 20% or 0.2

Now, we need to factor in the likelihood of an attacker being taller or shorter, given the information in "a":

* **Probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness is correct:** 
    * This is simply the witness's accuracy: 0.8

* **Probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness is wrong:**
    * This is the probability of an attacker being taller than 185 cm (15% or 0.15)

**Combining the Probabilities**

We use the following formula to calculate the overall probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm:

(Probability of witness being correct * Probability of attacker being taller given witness is correct) + (Probability of witness being wrong * Probability of attacker being taller given witness is wrong)

This translates to:

(0.8 * 0.8) + (0.2 * 0.15) = 0.66 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.66}
