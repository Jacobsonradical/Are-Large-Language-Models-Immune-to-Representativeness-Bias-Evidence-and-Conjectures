Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of heights and the distribution of attackers based on height.  
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions.

**Calculations**

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (from information a).

2. **Likelihoods:**
    * Likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are* 185 cm or taller: 80% (from information b).
    * Likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *shorter* than 185 cm: 20% (from information b).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

    Let:
    * A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
    * B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

    Bayes' Theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

    We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

    Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:
    * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
    * P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
