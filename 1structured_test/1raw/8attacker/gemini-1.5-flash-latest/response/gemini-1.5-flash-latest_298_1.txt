Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness's accuracy in judging height, but we need to consider they might be mistaken.
* **Attacker Population:**  The relative frequency of attackers being tall or short.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This is a classic example of using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* **¬A:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **¬B:** Witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is tall *given* the witness identified them as tall.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4286}
