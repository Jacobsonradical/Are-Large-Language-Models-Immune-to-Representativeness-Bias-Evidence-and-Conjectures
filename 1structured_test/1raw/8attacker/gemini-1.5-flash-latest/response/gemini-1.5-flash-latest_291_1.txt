Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information "a").
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (from information "a").

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.80 (from information "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.20 (from information "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculate P(B)**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**6. Calculate P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
