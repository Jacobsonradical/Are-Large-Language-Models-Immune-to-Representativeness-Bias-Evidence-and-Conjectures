Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**We are given:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are* 185 cm or taller = 80% (from 'a').
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are not* 185 cm or taller = 20% (from 'a').
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 15% (from 'b').
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of an attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller = 85% (from 'b').

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
