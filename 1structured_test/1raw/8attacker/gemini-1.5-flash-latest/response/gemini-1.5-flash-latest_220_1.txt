Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution (roughly equal numbers of people shorter and taller than 185 cm) and that attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.
* **Information b:** Provides a witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions. This is crucial because the witness is the only source of information about the attacker's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall.  This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):**  Prior probability the attacker is tall. This is 15% (from information a) since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall. This requires a bit more work and is calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 

    * P(B|not A): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they are *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
    * P(not A): Probability the attacker is not tall. This is 85% (from information a).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's identification and the information about the attacker population, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 or 48%.
