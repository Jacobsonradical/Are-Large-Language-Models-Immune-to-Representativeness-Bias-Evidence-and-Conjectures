Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the population distribution of heights and the attacker distribution within those heights. It's crucial for calculating prior probabilities.
* **Information b:** This provides us with the witness's accuracy in identifying height. This is our likelihood information.

**Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness's testimony:

P(Taller | Witness) = [P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Taller | Witness):** This is the probability we want to find - the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the witness's testimony.
* **P(Witness | Taller):** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as taller than 185 cm given they *actually* are taller than 185 cm.  From information b, this is 80% (0.8).
* **P(Taller):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm. From information a, this is 15% (0.15).
* **P(Witness):** This is the overall probability of the witness making the statement. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) * P(Shorter)
    * P(Witness | Shorter) = 20% (0.2) from information b
    * P(Shorter) = 85% (0.85) from information a

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(Witness):**
   P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4615}
