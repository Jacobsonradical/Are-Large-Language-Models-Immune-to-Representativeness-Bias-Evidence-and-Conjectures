Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Fact 1:** The population is split roughly in half regarding height (under 185 cm and 185 cm or taller).
* **Fact 2:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter (85% vs 15% for taller).
* **Witness Testimony:** The witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We know the witness is generally accurate but makes mistakes.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is 80% (from the witness accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is tall. This is 15% (from the general attacker height distribution).
* **P(B):** Probability the witness identifies someone as tall.  This needs to be calculated using the Law of Total Probability.

**Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  
* P(B) = 0.29

**Putting it together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as tall, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is only about 41%. This is because the witness is not perfect and the majority of attackers in general are shorter.
