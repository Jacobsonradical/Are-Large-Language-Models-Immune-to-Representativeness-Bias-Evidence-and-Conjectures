Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They have a 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height.
* **Information b:**  While the population is evenly split in terms of height, most attackers are shorter than 185 cm. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our "belief" is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and our "evidence" is the witness's statement.

Let's define the following events:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is evenly split, this is 0.5.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5 

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8}

**Conclusion**

Despite the high percentage of shorter attackers, the witness's strong accuracy makes it highly probable (80%) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
