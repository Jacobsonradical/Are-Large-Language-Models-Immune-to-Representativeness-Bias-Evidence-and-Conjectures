Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good estimator, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time. 
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, despite the population being roughly split.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define:

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:**  Event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they *are* that tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15% of attackers are taller).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
    
    where ¬A means the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller.

    * P(B|¬A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.
    * P(¬A): Probability that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48.**
