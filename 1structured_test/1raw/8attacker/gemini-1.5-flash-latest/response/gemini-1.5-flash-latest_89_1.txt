Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height (above or below 185 cm) under similar conditions. 
* **Information b:** The population is roughly split, but attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's define:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the percentage of attackers in the population who are tall, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of their actual height). We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26 

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
