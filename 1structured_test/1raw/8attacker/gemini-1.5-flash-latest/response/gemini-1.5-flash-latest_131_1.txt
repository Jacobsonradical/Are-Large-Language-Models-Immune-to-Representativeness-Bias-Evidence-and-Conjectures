Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the general population distribution of heights and the relative frequency of attackers within those height categories.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following events:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are that height. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information a, this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
