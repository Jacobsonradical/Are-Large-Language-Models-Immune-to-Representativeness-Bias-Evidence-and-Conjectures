Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is good at judging height, but not perfect.
* **Attacker Statistics:**  Most attackers are shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine these to find the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Prior Probability:**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *before* we consider the witness (from "b": 15%).
* **Likelihood:** The probability the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from "a": 80%).
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**Calculation**

Let's define events:

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B: Witness identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
