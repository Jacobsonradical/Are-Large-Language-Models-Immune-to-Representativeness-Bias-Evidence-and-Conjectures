Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the relative frequency of attackers in each height group.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall *given* the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall, given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.80.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker was tall. From information a, this is 0.15 (15% of attackers are tall).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall (regardless of their actual height). This requires the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
