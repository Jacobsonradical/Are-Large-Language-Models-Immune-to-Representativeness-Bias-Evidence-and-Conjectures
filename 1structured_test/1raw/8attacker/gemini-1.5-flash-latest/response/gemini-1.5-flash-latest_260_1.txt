Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but they are not perfect. They are likely to misclassify someone's height 20% of the time.
* **Information b:**  While the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **T:** The attacker is tall (185 cm or taller).
* **S:** The attacker is short (under 185 cm).
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as tall.

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|T):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is given by the population distribution of attackers, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion**

Despite the witness's testimony, the probability of the attacker being tall is only 48%. This is because the prior probability of attackers being tall is relatively low, even though the witness is quite accurate.
