Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a"**:  Tells us the general population split in terms of height (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information "b"**: Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the following:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate of 80% (from information "b"). 
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (from information "a").
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This is a bit more complex, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B| not A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as tall when they are actually short. This is 20% (from information "b").
    * P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being short (85% from information "a").

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B):** 
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
