Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is good at identifying height, but not perfect. They are right 80% of the time, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Information b:**  The population is split evenly between those shorter and taller than 185 cm, but attackers are more likely to be shorter (85% vs. 15%).

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.** 
   * If the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker actually being that height is 80% (from information a).
   * However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are actually that height (from information b).

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.**
   * If the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker actually being that height is 0% (since the witness was wrong).
   * However, the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

**Combining the Scenarios**

To get the overall probability, we need to weigh the probability of each scenario by the likelihood of that scenario occurring. 

* **Scenario 1 (Witness correct):** 80% chance of being correct * 15% chance of attacker being that height = 0.12 or 12%
* **Scenario 2 (Witness incorrect):** 20% chance of being wrong * 0% chance of attacker being that height = 0%

**Final Probability**

Add the probabilities from both scenarios: 12% + 0% = 12%

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.12}
