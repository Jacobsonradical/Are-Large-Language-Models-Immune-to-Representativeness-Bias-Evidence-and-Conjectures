Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness has a decent ability to judge height, but makes mistakes. They are correct 80% of the time when judging height in similar conditions.
* **Information b:**  While the population is split evenly in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. 

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to consider both the witness's testimony and the general attacker profile.  We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information:

* **Let A be the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller"**
* **Let B be the event "Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability an attacker is under 185 cm)

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
