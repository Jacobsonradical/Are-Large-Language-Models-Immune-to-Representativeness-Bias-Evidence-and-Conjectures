Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **a:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in judging height.  While they are generally accurate (80%), they misjudge height 20% of the time.
* **b:** This gives us the population distribution of attackers based on height.  Even though the population is roughly split, attackers under 185 cm are much more common.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(W|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given the attacker IS tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.80.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the population proportion of tall attackers, 0.15.
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This requires the Law of Total Probability:
   * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
   * P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
