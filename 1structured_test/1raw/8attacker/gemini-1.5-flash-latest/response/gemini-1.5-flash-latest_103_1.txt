Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of height (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can help us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's statement.

Let's define some events:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15 based on information a.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26 

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
