Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they actually are. This is 80% from the information given.
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% based on the population statistics.
* P(B) is the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(B)**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter. This is 20% from the information given.
* P(¬A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% from the population statistics.

So, P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
