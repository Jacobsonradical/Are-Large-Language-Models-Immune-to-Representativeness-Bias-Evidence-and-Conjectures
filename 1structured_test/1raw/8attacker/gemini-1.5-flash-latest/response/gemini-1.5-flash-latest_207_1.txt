Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us that the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population distribution is roughly 50/50.
* **Information b:** This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but with a caveat: their accuracy is based on ideal conditions, which may not reflect the actual attack scenario.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information from both sources.  Here's a way to approach it:

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information 'a'). 

2. **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information 'b').

3. **Posterior Probability:** We need to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.  We can use Bayes' Theorem for this:

   * **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)**

   *  Let's break down the terms:
      * **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is what we want to find – the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.
      * **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying a tall person, which is 0.8.
      * **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 0.15.
      * **P(Witness Says Tall):**  This is the probability of the witness saying someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. We need to calculate this.

4. **Calculating P(Witness Says Tall):** We need to consider the two scenarios:

   * **Scenario 1: Attacker is actually tall:**  The probability of the witness saying tall is 0.8 (from information 'b'). 
   * **Scenario 2: Attacker is actually short:** The probability of the witness saying tall is 0.2 (from information 'b' – the witness makes an error 20% of the time).

   *  To calculate P(Witness Says Tall), we need to consider the probability of each scenario happening:
      * **P(Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] + [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]** 
      * **P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28**

5. **Putting it all together:**
   *  **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
