Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:** Tells us that the population is roughly split in half (50/50) between people shorter and taller than 185 cm.  However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%).
* **Fact b:**  A witness identified the attacker as tall. This witness has a known accuracy rate, but we need to consider their potential for error.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is helpful for updating our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case, we want to update our belief about the attacker's height (tall or short) given the witness's testimony.

Here's the setup:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **Event B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as tall, given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.80
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the proportion of attackers in the population who are tall: 0.15 (from fact a)
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of the actual height).  This is a bit trickier to calculate, but we can use the law of total probability:

  * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or about 41.4%.  While the witness's testimony increases the probability from the initial 15%, it's still more likely that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
