Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the population statistics. 

* **Event A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the proportion of attackers who are tall in the population, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This requires a bit more work.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being short, which is 85% (0.85).

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
