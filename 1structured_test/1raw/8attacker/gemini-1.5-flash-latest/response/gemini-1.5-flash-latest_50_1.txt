Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To calculate P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

* P(¬A) = 0.85 (The probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

**Now, let's plug in the values:**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
