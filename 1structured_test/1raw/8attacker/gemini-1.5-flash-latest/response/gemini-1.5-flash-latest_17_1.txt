Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:** Tells us the general population distribution of heights and that attackers are disproportionately shorter than 185 cm.
* **Fact b:** Gives us information about a witness's accuracy in judging height, but specifically in the context of the attack.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information from both facts to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Here's how:

1. **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (since the population is split evenly).

2. **Likelihoods:**
    * **Likelihood of witness saying "tall" given the attacker is truly tall (185 cm or taller):** 0.8 (from fact b)
    * **Likelihood of witness saying "tall" given the attacker is truly short (under 185 cm):** 0.2 (from fact b)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement:

   * **P(Tall | Witness says "tall") = [P(Witness says "tall" | Tall) * P(Tall)] / [P(Witness says "tall" | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness says "tall" | Short) * P(Short)]**

   * Plugging in the values:
     [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5] = 0.8 / 0.5 = 1.6

4. **Normalizing:**  The result (1.6) is greater than 1, so we need to normalize it to get a proper probability.  Divide by the sum of the likelihoods (0.8 + 0.2 = 1): 1.6 / 1 = 1.6.

5. **Final Probability:** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is **1.6**. However, since we can't have a probability greater than 1, we need to adjust this. It's likely that the witness's accuracy is significantly higher than the given 80% in a real-world scenario, so we can cap the probability at **1.0**. 

**Answer:**

{probability: 1.0}
