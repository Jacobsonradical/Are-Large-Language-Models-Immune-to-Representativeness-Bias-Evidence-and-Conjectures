Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally good at judging height, but they're not perfect.
* **Information b:** While the population distribution is roughly even, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the overall likelihood of an attacker being a certain height.  We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information:

**Let:**

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

**We want to find:** P(A|B) - The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Let's break down each part:**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.  This is the population proportion of attackers in this height range, given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This requires a bit more calculation. We need to consider both the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone taller *and* the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's testimony and the overall distribution of attackers, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
