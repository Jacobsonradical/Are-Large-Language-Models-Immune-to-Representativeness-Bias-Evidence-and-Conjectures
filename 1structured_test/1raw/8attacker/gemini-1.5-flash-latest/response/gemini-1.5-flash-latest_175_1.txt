Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|not A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

We know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.33
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.36}
