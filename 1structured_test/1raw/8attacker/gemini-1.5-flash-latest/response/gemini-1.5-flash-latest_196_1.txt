Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us that there's a roughly even distribution of people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs 15% taller).
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability. They are generally accurate but have a 20% error rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information to get a more accurate estimate:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as taller than 185 cm given they actually are. This is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since we know the population is roughly split, this is approximately 0.5.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5 

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Explanation**

The witness's testimony significantly increases the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. While the general population is split, the witness's accuracy, combined with the fact that taller attackers are less common, makes the attacker being taller more likely.
