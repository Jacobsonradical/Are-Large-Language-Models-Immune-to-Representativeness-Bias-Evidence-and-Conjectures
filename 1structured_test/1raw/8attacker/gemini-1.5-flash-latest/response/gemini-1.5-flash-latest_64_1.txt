Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

* **P(B|A):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such (what we want to find).
* **P(A|B):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% from the problem).
* **P(B):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% from the problem).
* **P(A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(A):**

We can use the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)

* **P(A|not B):** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (20% from the problem).
* **P(not B):** The probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% from the problem).

So, P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(B|A):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
