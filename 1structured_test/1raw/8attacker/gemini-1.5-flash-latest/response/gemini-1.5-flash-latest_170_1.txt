Here's how to approach this problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of heights and how that differs from the distribution of attackers. 
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Logic**

We need to combine the information to determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. This is a classic application of Bayes' Theorem:

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B

**Let's Define Our Events**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

1. **P(A|B):**  This is the probability we want to find - the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness said so.

2. **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.

3. **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information a, this is 15% or 0.15.

4. **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
   *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.43 or 43%.**
