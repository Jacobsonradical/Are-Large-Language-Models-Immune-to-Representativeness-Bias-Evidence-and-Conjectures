Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  While the population is split evenly in height, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% under 185 cm). 
* **Fact b:** The witness is generally reliable, but has a 20% chance of error. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation lends itself to Bayesian reasoning, where we update our belief based on new evidence. Here's how to set it up:

* **Let's define events:**
    *  A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **We want to find:** P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, so 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is given by the population distribution, which is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This is a bit more complex, and we need to use the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness error rate when the attacker is short)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of the attacker being short)

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:** 

{probability: 0.48} 

**Explanation:**

The witness's identification increases the probability that the attacker was tall, but it doesn't make it certain.  The attacker is still more likely to have been short, but the witness's testimony significantly shifts the odds.
