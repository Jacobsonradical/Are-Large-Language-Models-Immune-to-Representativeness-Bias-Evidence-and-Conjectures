Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is generally reliable, but their accuracy is not perfect.
* **Information b:**  Attackers shorter than 185 cm are much more common than taller attackers.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a helpful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): The probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): The prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B): The prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating the probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually taller is 0.80 (from information a).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter is 0.20 (from information a).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.  We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
