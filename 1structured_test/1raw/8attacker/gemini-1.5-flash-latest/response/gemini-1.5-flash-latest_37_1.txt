Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a":**  The witness has a good chance of correctly identifying someone's height, but they are not perfect.
* **Information "b":**  Even though the population is roughly split, attackers in this category are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculation:**

We need to combine the information from the witness and the population statistics to estimate the probability.  Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Probability of Witness Saying "Taller" if the Attacker is Shorter:**  This is the 20% error rate from the witness. 
2. **Probability of Witness Saying "Taller" if the Attacker is Taller:** This is the 80% accuracy rate from the witness.
3. **Probability of the Attacker being Short:**  This is 85% from the population statistics.
4. **Probability of the Attacker being Tall:** This is 15% from the population statistics.

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement:

**P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)**

Let's break down the components:

* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is 0.15 (from the population statistics).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying "taller" regardless of the attacker's actual height. We need to calculate this:

    * P(Witness Says Tall) =  [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] + [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)]
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimated probability. The actual probability could be higher or lower depending on various factors not accounted for in the given information.
