Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the base rate of people in the population being shorter or taller than 185cm.  It also tells us the likelihood of an attacker falling into each height category.
* **Information b:** This tells us the accuracy of the witness's height estimation.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider both the base rate and the witness's accuracy to estimate the probability. 

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is 0.15 (given by information 'a').

2. **Likelihood:** The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller is 0.80 (given by information 'b').

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. 

   Bayes' Theorem: 
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

   Where:
   * P(A|B) = Probability of attacker being 185cm or taller given the witness's testimony (what we want to find).
   * P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller given that they actually are (0.80).
   * P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (0.15).
   * P(B) = Probability of the witness saying someone is 185cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

4. **Calculating P(B):**  
   * P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185cm or taller (0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12) and the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185cm or taller (0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17).
   * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

5. **Putting it together:**
   P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
