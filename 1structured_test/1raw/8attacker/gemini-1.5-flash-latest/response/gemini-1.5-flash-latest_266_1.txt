Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the witness's reliability in judging height. They're good at it, but not perfect. 
* **Information b:** This gives us the base rate of attackers in each height category.  There's a higher chance of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). 

Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Breaking Down the Components:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given the attacker *is* tall. This is 80% (from information a).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is 15% (from information b).
* **P(B):** The overall probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness is a reliable judge of height, the higher base rate of shorter attackers makes the probability of the attacker being tall relatively low (about 41.4%).
