Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the population distribution of heights. It also tells us that attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's accuracy.  

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **¬A:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they *are* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 50%, as the population is evenly split (0.5).
* **P(W):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated. 

**Calculating P(W)**

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|¬A) * P(¬A)

* **P(W|¬A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is also 50% (0.5).

Therefore:

P(W) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Putting it all together**

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8}
