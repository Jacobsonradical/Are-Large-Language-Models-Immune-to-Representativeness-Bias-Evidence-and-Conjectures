Here's how we can break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly. 
* **Information b:** This tells us a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, the witness isn't perfect and makes mistakes.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two possibilities:

1. **The witness is correct:**  The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. **The witness is wrong:** The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Let's calculate the probability of each possibility:

**Possibility 1: Witness is correct**

* Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 15% (from information a)
* Probability of witness correctly identifying height = 80% (from information b)

Probability of this scenario: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

**Possibility 2: Witness is wrong**

* Probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 85% (from information a)
* Probability of witness incorrectly identifying height = 20% (from information b)

Probability of this scenario: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

Now we have the probabilities of each scenario. To get the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, we need to normalize these probabilities:

* **Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller (given the witness statement) =  (Probability of possibility 1) / (Probability of possibility 1 + Probability of possibility 2)**

This is equal to: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
