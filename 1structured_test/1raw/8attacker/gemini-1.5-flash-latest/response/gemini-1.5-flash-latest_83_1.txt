Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is not perfect, but they have a reasonable chance of correctly identifying someone's height.
* **Information b:**  We know that while the population is roughly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculation:**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate of attackers being tall. We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability.

Let's define the events:

* **T:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

**Breaking down the terms:**

* **P(W|T):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (0.8).
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (0.15) based on the information about attackers.
* **P(W):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|~T) * P(~T) 
    * P(W|~T): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall when they are not. This is 20% (0.2).
    * P(~T): The probability of the attacker not being tall (1 - 0.15 = 0.85)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Putting it together:**

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
