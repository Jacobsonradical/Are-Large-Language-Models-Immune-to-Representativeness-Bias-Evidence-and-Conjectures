Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
