Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a"**:  This tells us that the attacker is *more likely* to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is roughly split.  
* **Information "b"**: This tells us the witness is generally reliable but not perfect. We need to account for their potential errors.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information from "a" and "b" to get a more accurate estimate of the attacker's height.

Let's define some events:

* **A**: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B**: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A)**: The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information "b").
* **P(A)**: The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information "a").
* **P(B)**: The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A)**: The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (from information "b").
* **P(not A)**: The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% (from information "a").

So,  P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
