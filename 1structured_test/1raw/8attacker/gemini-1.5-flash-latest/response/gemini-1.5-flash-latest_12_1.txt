Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the general population distribution of height and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:**  Provides information about a witness's ability to correctly identify height, regardless of the actual height distribution.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. 

Let's define the following events:

*  **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* **Not A:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.  This is the witness's accuracy (80% from information b).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% from information a.
* P(B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Not A) * P(Not A)

* P(B|Not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (20% from information b).
* P(Not A): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85% from information a).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug all the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
