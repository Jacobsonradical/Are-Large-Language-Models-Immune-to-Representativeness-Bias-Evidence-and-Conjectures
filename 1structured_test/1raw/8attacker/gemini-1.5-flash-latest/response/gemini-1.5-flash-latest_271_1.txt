Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* **¬B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(B|A), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(A|B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they actually are that tall. This is given as 80% (from information 'a').
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% (from information 'b').
* **P(A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this.

**4. Calculate P(A):**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)

* **P(A|¬B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter. This is the error rate, given as 20% (from information 'a').
* **P(¬B):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% (from information 'b').

Therefore:

P(A) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(B|A):**

Now we have all the components for Bayes' Theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
