Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the relative frequency of attackers in each height group.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. It helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly split, this is 50%.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8}
