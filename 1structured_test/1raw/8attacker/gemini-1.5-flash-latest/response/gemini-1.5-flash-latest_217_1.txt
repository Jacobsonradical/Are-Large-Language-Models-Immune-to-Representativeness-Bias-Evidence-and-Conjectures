Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but it doesn't directly tell us the probability of the attacker being tall.  
* **Information b:** This gives us the base rate of attackers being tall or short in the population. This is crucial for calculating the final probability.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (in this case, the attacker being tall) given new evidence (the witness's statement). 

Let's define the events:

* **T:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **S:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Here's how we apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|T):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall, given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 0.80 
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the base rate from information b: 0.15
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This is calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S) 
    * P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
