Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  This tells us the population is evenly split in terms of height (50% shorter than 185 cm, 50% 185 cm or taller). However, attackers disproportionately come from the shorter group.
* **Fact b:** This tells us the witness has a significant chance of error when judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's statement:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness):** The probability the attacker is tall given the witness said they were tall. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness | Tall):** The probability the witness would say someone is tall, given they are actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy (80% from fact b).
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 50% (from fact a, the population distribution).
* **P(Witness):** The probability of the witness saying someone is tall. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(Witness)**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Witness says tall, and the person is tall:**  P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4
2. **Witness says tall, but the person is short:** P(Witness | Short) * P(Short) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

P(Witness) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
