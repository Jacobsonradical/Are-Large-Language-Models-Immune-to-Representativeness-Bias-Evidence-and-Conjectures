Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us about the witness's reliability. They are correct about height 80% of the time. 
* **Information b:** This tells us about the distribution of attackers based on height.  Even though the population is evenly split, there's a significant bias towards shorter attackers.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony.

Let:

*  A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% or 0.15 (from information b).
* **P(B):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (regardless of the actual height). We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is not tall. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker *not* being tall. This is 85% or 0.85 (from information b).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
