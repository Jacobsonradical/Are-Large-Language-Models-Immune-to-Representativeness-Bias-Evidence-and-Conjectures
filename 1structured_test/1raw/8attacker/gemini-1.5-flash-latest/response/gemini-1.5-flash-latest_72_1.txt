Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Witness Testimony:** The witness is a good judge of height, but they're not perfect.  We need to factor in their error rate.
* **Population Distribution:** While the population is roughly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculations:**

1. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is correct 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance they misidentified someone's height.

2. **False Positive:**  The witness could have identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller even if they were shorter. This is the false positive rate, which is 20%.

3. **True Positive:** The witness could have accurately identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is the true positive rate, which is 80%.

4. **Attacker Height Distribution:**  85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given new evidence (the witness testimony). 

Let's define:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (this is the true positive rate). P(B|A) = 0.80
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from population data). P(A) = 0.15
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (this can happen in two ways: either the attacker is tall and identified correctly, or the attacker is short and misidentified).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's testimony and the attacker height distribution, there's a roughly 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
