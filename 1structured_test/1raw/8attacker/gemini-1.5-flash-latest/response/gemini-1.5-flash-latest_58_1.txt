Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height but makes mistakes.
* **Information b:** Attackers under 185 cm are far more common than attackers 185 cm or taller.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (from information a).
* **P(A):** Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information b).
* **P(B):**  Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, 20% (from information a).
* **P(not A):** Probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 85% (from information b).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
