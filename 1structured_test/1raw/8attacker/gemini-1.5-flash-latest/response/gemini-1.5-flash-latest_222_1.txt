Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
* **P(B|~A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they actually are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (based on the population statistics).
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.31
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.387

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.387.**

**{probability: 0.387}**
