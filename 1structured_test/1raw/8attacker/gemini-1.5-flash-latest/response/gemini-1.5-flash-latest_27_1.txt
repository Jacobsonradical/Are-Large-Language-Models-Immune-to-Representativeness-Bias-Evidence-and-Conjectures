Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a":** This tells us about the witness's accuracy in judging height. They are correct 80% of the time, but we need to consider the possibility they are wrong.
* **Information "b":** This tells us about the actual distribution of attacker heights in the population.  Even though the population is split evenly at 185 cm, 85% of attackers are shorter than this.

**Calculation:**

1. **Witness's Accuracy:** The witness is correct 80% of the time, meaning they misidentify height 20% of the time.

2. **Probability of Witness Being Right:** Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, if they say the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct.

3. **Probability of Witness Being Wrong:** The witness is wrong 20% of the time, meaning if they say the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance they are incorrect.

4. **Actual Distribution of Attacker Heights:** Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

**Putting it Together:**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the actual distribution of attacker heights. 

* **Scenario 1: Witness is correct:** If the witness is right, there's an 80% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, since only 15% of attackers are actually that tall, this scenario has a probability of 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2: Witness is wrong:** If the witness is wrong, there's a 20% chance they are misidentifying someone shorter than 185 cm as taller.  Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, this scenario has a probability of 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Final Calculation:**

To get the overall probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we add the probabilities of the two scenarios:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.29}
