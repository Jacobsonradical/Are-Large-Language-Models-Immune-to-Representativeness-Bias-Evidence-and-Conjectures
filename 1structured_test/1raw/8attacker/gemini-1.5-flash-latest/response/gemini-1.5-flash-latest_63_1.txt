Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the witness's accuracy in judging height.  They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning if someone is taller than 185cm, there's an 80% chance the witness will say so. Conversely, if someone is shorter than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly identify them as taller.
* **Information b:** This tells us the distribution of attacker heights in the population.  While the population is roughly split 50/50, most attackers (85%) are actually shorter than 185cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being taller than 185cm given the witness's testimony.

Let's define our events:

*  **A:** Attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A|B):** This is what we want to find – the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller given they *actually* are taller. This is 0.8 (from information a).
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. This is 0.15 (from information b).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185cm or taller. This is a bit trickier, we need to consider both cases:
    * Witness correctly identifying a taller person:  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person: P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
