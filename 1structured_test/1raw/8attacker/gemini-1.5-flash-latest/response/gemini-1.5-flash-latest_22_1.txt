Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information "a"**:  This tells us the witness's accuracy in judging height. 
* **Information "b"**: This tells us the actual distribution of attacker heights in the population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. 

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A)**: Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A)**: Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B)**: Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height).  We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
