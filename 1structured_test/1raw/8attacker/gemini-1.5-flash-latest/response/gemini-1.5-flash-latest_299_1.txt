Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us that the population is evenly split in terms of height (under 185 cm vs. 185 cm or taller). However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%).
* **Information b:**  Provides information about a witness's accuracy in identifying height. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller **given** the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15 (from information a).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

   * P(B|not A): Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller **given** the attacker is actually under 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
   * P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being under 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
