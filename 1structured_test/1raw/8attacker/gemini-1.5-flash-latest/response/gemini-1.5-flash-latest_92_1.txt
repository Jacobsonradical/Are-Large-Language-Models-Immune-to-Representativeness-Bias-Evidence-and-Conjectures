Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witness and the population statistics. This is a classic example of using Bayes' Theorem.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(B) = ? (We need to calculate this)

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
