Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but they still make mistakes.
* **Information b:**  Attackers shorter than 185 cm are more common than taller attackers.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15%, or 0.15, based on the population distribution of attackers.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(W|not A) is the probability the witness *incorrectly* identifies a short attacker as tall (20% or 0.2).
    * P(not A) is the probability of a short attacker (85% or 0.85).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(W):**
   P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
