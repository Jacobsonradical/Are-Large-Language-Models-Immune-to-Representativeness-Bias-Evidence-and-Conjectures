Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is a good judge of height but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time, meaning there's a 20% chance of error.
* **Information b:**  The population is roughly split in terms of height, but attackers are disproportionately shorter.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.**  
   * If the witness is correct in identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, the probability of the attacker being that height is 80% (from information a).

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.**
   * If the witness is incorrect, the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. 
   * The probability of this happening is 20% (from information a).
   * However, within this scenario, the probability of the attacker actually being taller than 185 cm is only 15% (from information b).

**Combining the Scenarios**

To get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to weigh the probability of each scenario:

* **Scenario 1:** 80% chance of being correct * 100% probability of attacker being tall = 80%
* **Scenario 2:** 20% chance of being incorrect * 15% probability of attacker being tall = 3%

**Final Calculation**

The overall probability is the sum of the probabilities from each scenario:

80% + 3% = 83%

**Answer:** {probability: 0.83}
