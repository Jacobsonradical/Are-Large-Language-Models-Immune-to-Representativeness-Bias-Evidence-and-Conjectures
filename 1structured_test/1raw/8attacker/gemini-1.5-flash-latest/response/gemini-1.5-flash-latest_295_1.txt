Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 between people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, 85% of attackers in this population are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** Provides a witness's accuracy rate in identifying height under similar conditions.  The witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two possibilities:

1. **The witness is correct:** If the witness is correct, then the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The probability of the witness being correct is 80%.
2. **The witness is incorrect:** If the witness is incorrect, then the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of the witness being incorrect is 20%.

**Combining the Information**

* **Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:** This is the probability that the witness is correct *and* the attacker is actually tall. 
    * This is equal to the probability of the witness being correct (80%) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness is correct (which is the 15% figure from information 'a').
    * Probability = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

* **Probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the witness's statement:** This is the probability that the witness is incorrect *and* the attacker is actually short. 
    * This is equal to the probability of the witness being incorrect (20%) multiplied by the probability of the attacker being short given the witness is incorrect (which is the 85% figure from information 'a').
    * Probability = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Final Calculation**

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness is correct divided by the sum of the two probabilities (attacker being tall given the witness is correct AND attacker being short given the witness is incorrect):

Probability = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
