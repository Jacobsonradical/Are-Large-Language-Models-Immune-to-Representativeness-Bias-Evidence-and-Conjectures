Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us about the general population distribution of heights and the relative frequency of attackers in each height group. 
* **Information b:** Provides information about the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 50% (0.5) since the population is roughly split in half.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A):  Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter. This is 20% (0.2).
    * P(not A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 50% (0.5).

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
