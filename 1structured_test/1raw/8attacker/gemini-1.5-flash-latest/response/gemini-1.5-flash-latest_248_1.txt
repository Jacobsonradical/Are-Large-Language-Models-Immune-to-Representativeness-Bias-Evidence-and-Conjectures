Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
