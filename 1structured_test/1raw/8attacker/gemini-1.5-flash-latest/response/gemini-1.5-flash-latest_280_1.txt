Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is good at judging height, but they're not perfect. 
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are *not*. This is the witness's error rate, given as 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** The probability of an attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
