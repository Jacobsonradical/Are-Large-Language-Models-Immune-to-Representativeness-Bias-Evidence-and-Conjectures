Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of heights (roughly equal shorter and taller than 185 cm) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.

Let:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall.  This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is tall. From information a, this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (regardless of their actual height). This requires considering both true positives and false positives:
    * **True Positives:**  Witness correctly identifies a tall attacker (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
    * **False Positives:** Witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)
    * **P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
