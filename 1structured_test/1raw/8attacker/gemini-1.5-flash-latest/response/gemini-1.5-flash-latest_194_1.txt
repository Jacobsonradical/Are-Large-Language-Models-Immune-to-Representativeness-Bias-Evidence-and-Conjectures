Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is good at judging height, but they're not perfect. They're right 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
* **Information b:** The attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. This is a crucial piece of information that overrides the witness's accuracy.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):** Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (what we want to find).
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually taller (from information a, 80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information b, 15%).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying "taller" (we need to calculate this).

**Calculating P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is taller (probability 15%) and the witness is right (probability 80%)
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter (probability 85%) and the witness is wrong (probability 20%)

```
P(B) = (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.29
```

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
