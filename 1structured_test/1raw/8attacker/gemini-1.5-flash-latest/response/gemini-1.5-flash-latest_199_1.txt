Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* **~B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(A|B):**  Probability the witness identifies someone correctly as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually that tall. This is given as 80% (0.8). 
* **P(B):** Prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% (0.15).
* **P(A):**  Probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|~B) * P(~B)
    * P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Calculate P(B|A):**

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4286}
