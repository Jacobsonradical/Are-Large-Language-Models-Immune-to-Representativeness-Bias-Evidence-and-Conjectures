Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness has a good chance of correctly identifying someone's height, but they're not perfect.
* **Information b:**  Attackers under 185 cm are far more common than attackers 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating the Probability**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information:

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information b) = 0.15
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height (from information a) = 0.8 
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that tall (from information a) = 0.8 
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (from information a) = 0.2

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30

**P(A|B) = 0.4**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
