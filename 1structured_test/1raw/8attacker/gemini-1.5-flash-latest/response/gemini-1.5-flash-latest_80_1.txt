Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  However, it doesn't directly tell us the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement.
* **Information b:** This provides us with the base rates of attackers being tall or short in the population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A): Prior probability of event A happening
* P(B): Prior probability of event B happening

**Let's define our events:**

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

**Now, let's plug in the information:**

* **P(B|A):** 0.8 (witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall)
* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being tall)
* **P(B|not A):** 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
* **P(not A):** 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being short)

**We need to calculate P(B):**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**Finally, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
