Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but doesn't tell us anything about the actual distribution of attacker heights.
* **Information b:** Provides the actual distribution of attacker heights in the population.  This is crucial for our calculation.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Where:

* **P(Tall | Witness):** Probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.  This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness | Tall):** Probability the witness would say someone is tall given they actually are tall (from information a: 80% or 0.8).
* **P(Tall):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall (from information b: 15% or 0.15).
* **P(Witness):** Overall probability of the witness saying someone is tall. We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(Witness)**

We can find P(Witness) using the Law of Total Probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short)

* **P(Witness | Short):** Probability the witness would say someone is tall given they are actually short (from information a: 20% or 0.2).
* **P(Short):** Prior probability of the attacker being short (from information b: 85% or 0.85).

Plugging in the values:

P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(Tall | Witness)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
