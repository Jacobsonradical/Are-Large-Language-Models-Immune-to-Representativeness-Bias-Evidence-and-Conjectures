Here's how we can break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable in identifying height but has a 20% error rate.
* **Information b:**  While the population is split evenly, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  Probability of event A (attacker is 185 cm or taller) given event B (witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller).  This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of event B (witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller) given event A (attacker is actually 185 cm or taller). This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185 cm or taller). This is the base rate of attackers being taller (15%).
* **P(B):** Probability of event B (witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller). We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter (20%, the witness's error rate).
* **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker being shorter (85%).

Plugging in the numbers:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
