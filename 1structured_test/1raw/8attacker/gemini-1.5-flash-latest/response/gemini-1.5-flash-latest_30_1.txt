Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information "a", this is 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. From information "b", this is 0.8.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.  This is 0.2 (from information "b", the witness errs 20% of the time).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculate P(B)**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**6. Calculate P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
