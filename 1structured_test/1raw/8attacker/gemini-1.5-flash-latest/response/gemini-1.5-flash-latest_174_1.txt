Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information 'a':**  This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height. It's important to note that the witness is more likely to correctly identify someone as being tall when they actually are tall, but also has a chance of incorrectly identifying someone as tall when they're actually short. 
* **Information 'b':** This tells us the actual prevalence of tall vs. short attackers in the population. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define some variables:

* **T:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **S:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|T):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall given they are actually tall. From information 'a', this is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. From information 'b', this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. This requires considering both cases (tall attacker and short attacker):
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's statement and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615, or about 46%.
