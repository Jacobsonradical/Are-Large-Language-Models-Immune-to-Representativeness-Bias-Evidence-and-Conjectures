Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information 'a':**  This tells us about the witness's reliability. They're good at judging height, but they're not perfect.
* **Information 'b':** This tells us about the general population of attackers.  While the population is roughly split in half by height, most attackers are actually shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine both pieces of information to get our estimate. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 50% (based on the population split). We'll call this P(Tall).
2. **Likelihood of Witness Saying 'Tall':**
   *  P(Witness says Tall | Attacker is Tall) = 80% (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
   *  P(Witness says Tall | Attacker is Short) = 20% (the witness is wrong 20% of the time)
3. **Likelihood of Attacker Being Tall:** 
   *  P(Attacker is Tall) = 15% (from information 'b')
   *  P(Attacker is Short) = 85% (from information 'b')

4. **Bayes' Theorem:** We use Bayes' Theorem to combine these probabilities:

   P(Attacker is Tall | Witness says Tall) = [P(Witness says Tall | Attacker is Tall) * P(Attacker is Tall)] / [P(Witness says Tall | Attacker is Tall) * P(Attacker is Tall) + P(Witness says Tall | Attacker is Short) * P(Attacker is Short)]

5. **Plugging in the numbers:**

   P(Attacker is Tall | Witness says Tall) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] 
   = 0.12 / 0.34
   â‰ˆ 0.353

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353} 

**Explanation:**

Even though the witness said the attacker was tall, the high percentage of short attackers in the population (85%) makes it more likely that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.
