Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  From statement (a), 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:**  From statement (a), 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** From statement (b), the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** From statement (b), the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**To calculate P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.29
```

**Now, we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
       = 0.4138 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
