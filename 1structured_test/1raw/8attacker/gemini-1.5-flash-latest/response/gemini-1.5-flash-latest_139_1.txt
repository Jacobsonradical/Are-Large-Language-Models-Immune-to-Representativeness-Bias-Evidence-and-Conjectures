Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** The witness has a good ability to judge height, correctly identifying 80% of the time in similar conditions. However, this is a general accuracy, not specific to this case.
* **Information b:**  The population distribution of heights is roughly equal, but attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. This is important prior information.

**2. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller (let's call this "T")
* **Evidence:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (let's call this "W")

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|T):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall given the attacker is actually tall (from information a, this is 0.8).
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall (from information b, this is 0.15).
* **P(W):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. This needs to be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T) 
          = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 
          = 0.28

**3. Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 
       = 0.429 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
