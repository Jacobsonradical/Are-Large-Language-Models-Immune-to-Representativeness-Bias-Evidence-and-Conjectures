Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the relative frequency of attackers in each height category.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually are* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b). 
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  Since the population is roughly split, this is 50%.
* **P(B):** The overall probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier and requires the law of total probability. We can calculate it as:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter). This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 50%.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.50) + (0.20 * 0.50) = 0.50

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.50) / 0.50 = 0.80

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.80} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller increases to 80%. This is higher than the initial probability (50%) due to the witness's relatively high accuracy.
