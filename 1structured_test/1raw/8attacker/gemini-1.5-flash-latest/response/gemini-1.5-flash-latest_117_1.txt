Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable (80% accuracy), but we need to account for their potential error.
* **Information b:**  Attackers under 185 cm are significantly more common than attackers 185 cm or taller. This is crucial information for our calculation.

**Calculating the Probability:**

1. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness has a 20% chance of misidentifying someone's height. 
2. **Population Proportion:**  Since the population is roughly split, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 50%. 
3. **Combining the Information:** We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the actual proportion of attackers in each height group.

**Let's use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability:**

* **Event A:**  Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:**  Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Breaking down the terms:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 50%.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Plugging the values into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}

**Conclusion:**

The updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%. This is higher than the initial prior probability of 50% due to the witness's relatively high accuracy.
