Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable, but has a 20% error rate in judging height under similar conditions.
* **Information b:**  While the population is roughly split in terms of height, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%).

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information b) = 0.15
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (from information b) = 0.85
* **P(W|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller (from information a) = 0.80
* **P(W|B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* shorter than 185 cm (from information a) = 0.20 

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)]

**Calculation:**

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
