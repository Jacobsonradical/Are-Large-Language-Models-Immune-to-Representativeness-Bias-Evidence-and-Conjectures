Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**Information provided:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|not A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that an attacker is under 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.4}
