Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us about the witness's reliability. They are good at identifying height, but they make mistakes.
* **Information b:** This tells us about the general distribution of attacker heights in the population.  

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.  In this case:

* **Event:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so):**  This is what we want to find - the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.
* **P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller):** This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller):** This is the prior probability of an attacker being tall, which is 15% based on the population distribution.
* **P(Witness says so):** This is the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall.  We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(Witness says so)**

To calculate the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Attacker is tall:** 
    * Probability of attacker being tall: 15%
    * Probability of witness being correct: 80%
    * Combined probability: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2. **Attacker is short:**
    * Probability of attacker being short: 85%
    * Probability of witness being wrong: 20%
    * Combined probability: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**P(Witness says so) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = [P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness says so)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 

**Probability = 0.41 (approximately)**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
