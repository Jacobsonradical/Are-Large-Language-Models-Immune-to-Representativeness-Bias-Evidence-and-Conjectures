Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but makes mistakes. 
* **Information b:**  While the population is evenly split, attackers are disproportionately shorter.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall *given* they are actually tall.  This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the proportion of attackers who are tall, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (regardless of their actual height). We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall *given* they are actually short. This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being short, which is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.  This is significantly higher than the prior probability of 15% but still indicates that it's more likely the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
