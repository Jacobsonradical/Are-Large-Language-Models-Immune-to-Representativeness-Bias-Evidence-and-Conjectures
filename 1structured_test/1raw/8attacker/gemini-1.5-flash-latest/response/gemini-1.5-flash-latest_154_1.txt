Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from statement "a").
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (from statement "a").
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are (from statement "b").
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter (from statement "b").

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**Plugging in our values:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.**

**{probability: 0.4}**
