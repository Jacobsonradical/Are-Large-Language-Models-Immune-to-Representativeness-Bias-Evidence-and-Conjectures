Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Information:**

* **a:** The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. 
* **b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is roughly split.

**2. Bayesian Approach:**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.

* **Let's define the events:**
    *  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy: 0.80.

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given in the population: 0.15.

* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculating the Probability:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
