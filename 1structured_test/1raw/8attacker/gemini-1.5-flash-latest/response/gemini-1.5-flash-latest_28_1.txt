Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%).
* **Information b:** This introduces a witness who is 80% accurate in identifying height.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.**  
   * The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   * The witness is correct 80% of the time.
   * This means there's an 80% chance the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.**
   * The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
   * The witness is incorrect 20% of the time.
   * This means there's a 20% chance the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

**Combining the Scenarios**

We need to factor in the attacker's height distribution from information "a".

* **Scenario 1:** 80% chance the witness is right, and 15% chance the attacker is actually that height. This gives us 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 probability.
* **Scenario 2:** 20% chance the witness is wrong, and 85% chance the attacker is actually that height. This gives us 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 probability.

**Final Calculation**

To get the overall probability, we add the probabilities of each scenario:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.29}
