Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the distribution of heights in the general population and how that distribution compares to the distribution of attacker heights.
* **Information b:**  This provides us with the witness's accuracy in identifying heights in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Said Tall) = [P(Witness Said Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Said Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Said Tall):** This is the probability we want to find - the probability the attacker was tall given the witness said they were tall.
* **P(Witness Said Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy in identifying tall people, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on information 'a'.
* **P(Witness Said Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying the person was tall, which we can calculate using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness Said Tall) = P(Witness Said Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Said Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)
    * P(Witness Said Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Said Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
