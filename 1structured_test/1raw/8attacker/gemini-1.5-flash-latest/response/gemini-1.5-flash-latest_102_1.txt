Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the general population distribution of height and the tendency of attackers to be shorter.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in judging height and the population distribution they were tested on.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) given new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information a, we know this is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both cases:

    *  Witness correctly identifying a tall person: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness incorrectly identifying a short person: P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 

    Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
