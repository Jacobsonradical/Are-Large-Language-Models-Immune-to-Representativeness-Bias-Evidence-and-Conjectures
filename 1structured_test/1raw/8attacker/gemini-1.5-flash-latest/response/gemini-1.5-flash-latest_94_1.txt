Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let **A** be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let **B** be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Gather Probabilities**

*  **P(A) = 0.15:** This is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the population statistics.
*  **P(¬A) = 0.85:**  This is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
*  **P(B|A) = 0.80:** This is the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from the witness's accuracy).
*  **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** This is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter.

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Let's plug in our values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
