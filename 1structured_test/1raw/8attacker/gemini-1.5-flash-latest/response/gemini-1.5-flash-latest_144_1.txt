Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Fact a:**  This tells us about the general population distribution of heights and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category. 
* **Fact b:**  This provides information about the witness's reliability in judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.

Let:

* A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* B = Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (0.15) according to fact 'a'.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both scenarios: 
    * The witness is correct about the attacker's height (80% chance, attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, probability of this scenario is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12).
    * The witness is wrong about the attacker's height (20% chance, attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, probability of this scenario is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
