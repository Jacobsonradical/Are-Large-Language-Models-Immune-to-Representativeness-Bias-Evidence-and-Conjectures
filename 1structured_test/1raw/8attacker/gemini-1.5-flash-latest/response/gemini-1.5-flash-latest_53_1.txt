Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category. 
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation is well-suited to using Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony.

Let's define the events:

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:**  The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  Since the population is roughly split, this is 50% or 0.5.
* **P(B):**  The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A):  The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is also 50% or 0.5.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
