Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.
* **Information b:**  While the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Let's define events:**
    *  A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **We want to find:** P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Breaking Down the Formula:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the attacker distribution, 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (regardless of their actual height).  This is a bit trickier, but we can calculate it:
    *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)  = 0.28 

**Calculating the Final Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28  = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
