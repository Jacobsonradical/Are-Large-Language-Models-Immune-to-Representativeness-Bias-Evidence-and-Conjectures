Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** This tells us about the general population and the typical attacker height distribution.  
    * 50% of the population is under 185 cm, and 50% is 185 cm or taller.
    * 85% of attackers are under 185 cm.
    * 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

* **Information b:** This tells us about the witness's reliability.
    * The witness is correct 80% of the time in identifying someone's height.
    * The witness is wrong 20% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.** 
   * If the witness is correct, the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
   * The probability of the witness being correct is 80%.

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.**
   * If the witness is incorrect, the attacker is actually under 185 cm. 
   * The probability of the witness being incorrect is 20%.

Now, we need to combine these scenarios with the attacker height distribution:

* **Scenario 1 (Witness Correct):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness is correct, is 1 (or 100%).

* **Scenario 2 (Witness Incorrect):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness is incorrect, is 0 (or 0%). This is because if the witness is wrong, the attacker must be under 185 cm.

**Final Calculation:**

To find the overall probability, we weight the probability of each scenario by its likelihood:

Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = [Probability (Scenario 1) * Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Scenario 1)] + [Probability (Scenario 2) * Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Scenario 2)]

Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 1) + (0.2 * 0) 
Probability (Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
