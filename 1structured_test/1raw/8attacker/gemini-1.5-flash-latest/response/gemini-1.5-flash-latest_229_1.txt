Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us about the general population distribution of heights and the relative likelihood of attackers being in each height category.
* **Information b:** This gives us the witness's accuracy in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information from both sources to get a more accurate estimate of the probability:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) =  
[P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall) 
```

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is what we want to find â€“ the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said they were tall.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the prior probability of an attacker being tall, which is 0.15 (from information a).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall, regardless of their actual height.  We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short) 
    * P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                         = 0.414 
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
