Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but with a crucial caveat: their accuracy is based on a balanced sample (50% short, 50% tall). This means their accuracy might be different when applied to the actual population distribution.

**Calculating the Probability**

1. **Prior Probability:**  Since the population is roughly split in half, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

2. **Likelihoods:**
   * **Likelihood of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall:** 0.8 (from information b)
   * **Likelihood of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually short:** 0.2 (from information b)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  We'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony):

   P(Tall | Witness says "tall") = [P(Witness says "tall" | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness says "tall")

   * **P(Witness says "tall" | Tall):** 0.8 (likelihood of the witness being correct)
   * **P(Tall):** 0.5 (prior probability of the attacker being tall)
   * **P(Witness says "tall")** : This is the probability of the witness saying "tall" regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
        * P(Witness says "tall") = P(Witness says "tall" | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness says "tall" | Short) * P(Short)
        * P(Witness says "tall") = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

   P(Tall | Witness says "tall") = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
