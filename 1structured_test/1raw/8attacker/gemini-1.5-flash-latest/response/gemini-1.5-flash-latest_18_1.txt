Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the population distribution of heights. We know that roughly 50% of the population is below 185 cm and 50% is 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are not representative of the general population. 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Information b:** This introduces the witness's testimony and their reliability.  We know they correctly identify height 80% of the time and make a mistake 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This is a classic example of applying Bayes' Theorem to update our belief based on new evidence.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Let's define events:**
    *  A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find:**  P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

* **Bayes' Theorem:** 
    P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **Breaking down the terms:**
    * P(B|A): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they *are* tall (from information b, this is 80% or 0.8).
    * P(A): The prior probability the attacker is tall (from information a, this is 15% or 0.15).
    * P(B): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall (we need to calculate this).

* **Calculating P(B):**
    We use the law of total probability:
    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A): The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given they are *not* tall (from information b, this is 20% or 0.2).
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is not tall (from information a, this is 85% or 0.85).

    Therefore:
    P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

* **Putting it all together:**
    P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
