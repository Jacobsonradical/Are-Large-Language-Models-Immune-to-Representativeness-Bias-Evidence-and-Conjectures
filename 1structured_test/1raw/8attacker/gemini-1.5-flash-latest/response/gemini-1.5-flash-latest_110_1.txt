Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.**

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30

**P(A|B) = 0.4**

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
