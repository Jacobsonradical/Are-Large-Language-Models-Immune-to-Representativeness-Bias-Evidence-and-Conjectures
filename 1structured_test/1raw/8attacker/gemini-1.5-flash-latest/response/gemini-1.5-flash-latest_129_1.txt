Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the assumed equal distribution of heights in the sample they were tested on.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem.  Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given in information a as 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, 0.2 (20%).
    * P(not A): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48.**
