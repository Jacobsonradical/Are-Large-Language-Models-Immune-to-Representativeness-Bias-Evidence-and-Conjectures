Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness testimony:** The witness is not perfect, but has a certain accuracy in judging height.
* **Attacker population:** The population of attackers has a different distribution of heights than the general population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the proportion of attackers in the population who are this height, 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). This requires the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
