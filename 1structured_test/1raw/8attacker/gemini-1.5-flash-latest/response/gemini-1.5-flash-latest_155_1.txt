Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is a good judge of height, but they make mistakes.
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the general attacker population:

* Let A be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller".
* Let B be the event "witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% (0.8) from information "a".
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (0.15) from information "b".
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  This requires a bit more work. We need to consider both cases:

    * **Case 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller:**  Probability = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (witness is correct)
    * **Case 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm:** Probability = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness is wrong)

    Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
