Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  Importantly, they are more likely to correctly identify someone as tall when they *are* tall, but also more likely to incorrectly identify someone as tall when they are *not* tall.
* **Information b:** This gives us the base rates of attackers being tall or short.  We know there's an imbalance in the proportion of attackers in each height category.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Where:

* P(Tall | Witness) = Probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement
* P(Witness | Tall) = Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they *are* tall (80% from information a)
* P(Tall) = Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from information b)
* P(Witness) = Overall probability of the witness making the statement (we'll calculate this below)

**Calculating P(Witness):**

To find P(Witness), we need to consider the two ways the witness could make the statement:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is tall, witness is correct:**  P(Tall) * P(Witness | Tall) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is short, witness is wrong:** P(Short) * P(Witness | Short) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

P(Witness) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
