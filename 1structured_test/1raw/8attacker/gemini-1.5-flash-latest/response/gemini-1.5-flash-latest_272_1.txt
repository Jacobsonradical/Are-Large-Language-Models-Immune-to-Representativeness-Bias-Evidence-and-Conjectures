Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the general population and the attacker profile. While the population is roughly split 50/50, attackers are disproportionately shorter.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's reliability in identifying height, which is not perfect.

**Combining the Information**

We need to consider both pieces of information to estimate the probability. 

1. **Prior Probability:**  Based on information "a", the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of attackers are in that height range).

2. **Likelihood:** Information "b" gives us the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the prior probability and the likelihood to get our estimate. 

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened (the witness's accuracy)
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A (the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* P(B) is the probability of event B (the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

* Let A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* Let B = Witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller

* P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (from information b)
* P(B) = We need to calculate this 

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller (A): The witness is correct 80% of the time.
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A): The witness is wrong 20% of the time (and will identify them incorrectly as taller).

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  
     = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.25
       = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, our estimate is that the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 or 48%.**
