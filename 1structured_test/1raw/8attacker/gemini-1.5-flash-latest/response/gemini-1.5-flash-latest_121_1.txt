Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Fact 1:** The population is roughly split 50/50 between people shorter and taller than 185 cm. This tells us the prior probability of someone being taller than 185 cm is 0.5.
* **Fact 2:**  Most attackers are shorter than 185 cm (85%), indicating a potential bias in the type of attacker.
* **Fact 3:** The witness is generally reliable (80% accuracy), but they could be wrong 20% of the time.

**Combining the Information:**

We need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: The witness is correct.** If the witness is accurate, the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The probability of this scenario is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).

2. **Scenario 2: The witness is incorrect.** If the witness is wrong, the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this scenario is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

**Calculating the Estimated Probability:**

We need to weigh the probability of each scenario by the likelihood of the attacker's height in each scenario:

* **Scenario 1:** 
    * Probability of witness being correct: 0.8
    * Probability of attacker being taller than 185 cm given witness is correct: 1 (since we're assuming the witness is correct)
    * Probability of this scenario: 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

* **Scenario 2:**
    * Probability of witness being incorrect: 0.2
    * Probability of attacker being taller than 185 cm given witness is incorrect: 0 (since the witness is incorrect)
    * Probability of this scenario: 0.2 * 0 = 0

**Final Calculation:**

The overall estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probabilities of each scenario where the attacker is taller:

0.8 + 0 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
