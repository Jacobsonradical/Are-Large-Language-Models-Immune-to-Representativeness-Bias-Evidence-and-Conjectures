Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the general distribution of heights in the population and that attackers disproportionately come from the shorter group.
* **Information b:** Provides the accuracy of the witness's height judgment under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem lends itself well to Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's statement).

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is given as 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. Since the population is roughly split, we can assume this is 50% (or 0.5).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as tall, regardless of their actual height. This requires us to consider both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1:**  Witness correctly identifies a tall person (P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4)
    * **Scenario 2:** Witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
