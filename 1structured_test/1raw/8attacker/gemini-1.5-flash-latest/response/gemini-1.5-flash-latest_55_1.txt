Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height and the distribution of heights in their test sample.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem.  Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (from information b).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is 85% (from information a).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we have all the pieces:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
