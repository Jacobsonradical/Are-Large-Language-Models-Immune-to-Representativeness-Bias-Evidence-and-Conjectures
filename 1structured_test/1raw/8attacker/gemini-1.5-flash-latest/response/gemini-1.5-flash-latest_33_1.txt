Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us about the general population distribution of heights and the likelihood of attackers being in each height category.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the witness's reliability in identifying heights.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine this information and calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's testimony.

* **Let's define events:**
    * **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    * **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

* **We need to find:** P(A|B) - the probability that the attacker is tall (event A) given the witness's testimony (event B).

* **Bayes' Theorem:** 
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Breaking down the components of Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as tall, given they *are* tall (80% from information b).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone being tall (15% from information a).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness might identify someone as tall:

1. **Witness is correct:**  The person is tall (A) and the witness identifies them correctly (B|A). This probability is P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

2. **Witness is wrong:** The person is short (not A) and the witness identifies them as tall (B|not A). This probability is P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

* **Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.4138}
