Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the distribution of attackers within those height categories.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's statement:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness):** The probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement (what we want to find).
* **P(Witness | Tall):** The probability the witness would identify someone as tall, given they are actually tall (80% accuracy from information b).
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from information a).
* **P(Witness):** The probability of the witness making their statement.  This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short) 
    * P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability:**

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                = 0.12 / 0.29
                â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
