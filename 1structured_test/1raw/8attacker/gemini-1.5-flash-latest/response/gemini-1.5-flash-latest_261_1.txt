Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|~A) = 0.20:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(~A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
