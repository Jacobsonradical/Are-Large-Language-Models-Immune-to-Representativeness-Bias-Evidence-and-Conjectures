Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are not.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from the population statistics).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
