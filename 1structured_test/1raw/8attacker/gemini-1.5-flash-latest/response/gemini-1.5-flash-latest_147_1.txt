Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is good at judging height (80% accuracy), but we don't know if they identified the attacker as taller or shorter.
* **Information b:**  Attackers under 185 cm are much more common than those 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

* **Let A** represent the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller"
* **Let B** represent the event "Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 0.8
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is given in the population statistics: 0.15
* **P(B):** Overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This requires considering both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker is tall (P(A) = 0.15), and the witness identifies them correctly (P(B|A) = 0.8)
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is short (P(A') = 0.85), and the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall (P(B|A') = 0.2)

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|A') * P(A')] 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
