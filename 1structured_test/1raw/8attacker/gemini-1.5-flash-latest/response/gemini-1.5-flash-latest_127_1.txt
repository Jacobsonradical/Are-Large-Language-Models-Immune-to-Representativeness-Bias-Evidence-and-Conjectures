Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information 'a':**  The witness is generally reliable (80% accuracy) but their judgment is not perfect.
* **Information 'b':**  While the population is split evenly, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony. 

* Let 'A' represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let 'B' represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.  This is the proportion of attackers in the population who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
