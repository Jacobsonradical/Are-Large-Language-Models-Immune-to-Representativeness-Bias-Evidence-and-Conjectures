Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 in terms of height (below 185 cm vs. 185 cm or taller). However, attackers are disproportionately shorter, with 85% being under 185 cm. 
* **Information b:**  A witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We know the witness is accurate 80% of the time and inaccurate 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony.

Let's define:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. From information a, this is approximately 0.15 (15% of attackers are tall).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall.  This is where we need to consider both cases: the attacker being tall and the attacker being short.

**Calculating P(B)**

* **P(B|A) * P(A):**  (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12 (Probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being tall)
* **P(B|not A) * P(not A):** (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17 (Probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker being short)

Now, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
