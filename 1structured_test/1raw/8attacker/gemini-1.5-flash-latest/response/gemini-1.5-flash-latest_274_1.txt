Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is a good judge of height, correctly identifying 80% of the time. However, this is based on an equal sample size of people shorter and taller than 185 cm. 
* **Information b:** The population is roughly split in terms of height, but the actual attackers are skewed, with significantly more attackers under 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):**  This is the probability we want to find - the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):**  This is the probability the witness will say the attacker is tall, given the attacker actually is tall. This is 80% (from information a).
* **P(Attacker Tall):**  This is the prior probability of an attacker being tall. This is 15% (from information b).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the overall probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(Witness Says Tall)**

P(Witness Says Tall) =  P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)

* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short):** This is the probability the witness will say the attacker is tall, given the attacker is actually short. This is 20% (from information a).
* **P(Attacker Short):** This is the prior probability of an attacker being short. This is 85% (from information b).

Plugging in the values:

P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug all the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
