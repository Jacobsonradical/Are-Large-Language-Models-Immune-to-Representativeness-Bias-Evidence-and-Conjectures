Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **a:** The witness is a good estimator of height, but they have a chance of error. 
* **b:**  While the population is roughly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness):** The probability the attacker was tall given the witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness | Tall):** The probability the witness would identify someone as tall given they actually were tall (80% accuracy). 
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% based on population of attackers).
* **P(Witness):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(Witness) = P(Witness | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness | Short) * P(Short)
    * P(Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug in the values:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(Tall | Witness) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
