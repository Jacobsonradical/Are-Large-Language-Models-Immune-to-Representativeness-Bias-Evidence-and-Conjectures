Here's how we can break down the problem to arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the relative frequency of attackers in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event (attacker's height) given new evidence (witness's testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **W:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

**Breaking Down the Components**

* **P(W|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given by the population distribution, which is 50% or 0.5.
* **P(W):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)
    * P(W|B): Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(B): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 50% or 0.5.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(W):**
   P(W) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

2. **Calculate P(A|W):**
   P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer**

{probability: 0.8}
