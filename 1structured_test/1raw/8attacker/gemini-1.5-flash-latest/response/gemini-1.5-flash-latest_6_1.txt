Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the witness's reliability in judging height. 
* **Information b:** This gives us the actual distribution of attackers based on height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

Let:

*  **A:**  The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **W:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are. From information a, this is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information b, this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
