Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the distribution of attacker heights in the general population.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8). 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15) from information a.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
