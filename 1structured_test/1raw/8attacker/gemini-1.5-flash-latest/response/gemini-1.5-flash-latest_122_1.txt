Here's how we can break down the problem to arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  We know the population is roughly split 50/50 between people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs. 15%). 
* **Fact b:** A witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) given new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **¬A:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness claims someone is tall given they actually are tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.80.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the proportion of tall attackers in the population: 0.15 (from fact a).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness claiming someone is tall.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
