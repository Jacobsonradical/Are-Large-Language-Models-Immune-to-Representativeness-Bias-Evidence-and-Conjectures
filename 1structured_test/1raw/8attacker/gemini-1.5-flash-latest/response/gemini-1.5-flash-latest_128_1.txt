Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information 'a'**:  This tells us about the witness's reliability.  They correctly identify height 80% of the time, but are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Information 'b'**:  This tells us the actual distribution of attacker heights in the population.  While the population is split evenly at 185 cm, most attackers are shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculations**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness information with the population information.

Let:

* **A** = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B** = Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A)** = Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.  This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A)** = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% from information 'b').
* **P(B)** = Overall probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both scenarios (attacker is taller or shorter):
    *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Putting it together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
