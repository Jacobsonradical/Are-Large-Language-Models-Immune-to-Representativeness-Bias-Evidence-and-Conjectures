Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height group.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** The probability we want to find â€“ the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said they were tall.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as tall given they actually are tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (0.8).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (0.15) based on information 'a'.
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** The probability the witness says someone is tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

   P(Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short)

   * P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are short. This is 20% (0.2) since the witness errs 20% of the time.
   * P(Attacker Short): The prior probability of the attacker being short. This is 85% (0.85) based on information 'a'.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(Witness Says Tall):**
   P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
