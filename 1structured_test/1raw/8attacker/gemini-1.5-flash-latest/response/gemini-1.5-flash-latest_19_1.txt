Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is roughly split evenly between people shorter and taller than 185 cm.  However, 85% of attackers are in the shorter group. This implies that attackers are *disproportionately* likely to be shorter than 185 cm.
* **Information b:** A witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  The witness has a good but not perfect ability to judge height (80% accuracy).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem lends itself to Bayesian reasoning. We want to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness testimony.  Let's use these symbols:

* **T:** Attacker is tall (185 cm or taller)
* **S:** Attacker is short (under 185 cm)
* **W:** Witness says the attacker is tall

We want to find P(T|W), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness statement. Bayes' Theorem gives us:

P(T|W) = [P(W|T) * P(T)] / P(W)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W|T):** Probability the witness says "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8 (80%).
* **P(T):** Prior probability the attacker is tall.  From information "a," this is approximately 0.15 (15%).
* **P(W):** Probability the witness says "tall."  This needs to be calculated considering both possibilities (attacker is tall or short):
    * P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|S) * P(S)
    * P(W|S) = 0.2 (witness error rate)
    * P(S) = 0.85 (prior probability of attacker being short)

**Calculations**

1. **P(W):** 
   * P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(T|W):**
   * P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Explanation:**

Despite the witness saying the attacker was tall, the probability of the attacker actually being tall is still relatively low (about 41%). This is because the prior probability of an attacker being short is much higher (85%) due to the information given in part "a".
