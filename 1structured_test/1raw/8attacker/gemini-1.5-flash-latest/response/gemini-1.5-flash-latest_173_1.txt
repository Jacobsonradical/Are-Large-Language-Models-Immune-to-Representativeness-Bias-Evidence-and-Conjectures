Here's how we can break down the problem to find the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  We know the population is roughly split 50/50 between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs 15%).
* **Fact b:** A witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, the witness is not perfect, having an 80% accuracy rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's testimony). Here's how it applies:

* **Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".**
* **Let B be the event "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 0.15, based on the information about attackers being taller.
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of the actual height). We can calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as tall, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is only about 41.4%. This is due to the fact that the witness is not perfectly accurate, and the population of attackers is more likely to include shorter people.
