Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of heights and the attacker distribution within those heights.
* **Information b:** Provides data on the witness's accuracy in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This is a classic case for applying Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the witness's identification.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that an attacker is tall. This is given as 15% (0.15) in information a.
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (regardless of their actual height). This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as tall given they are *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not A):** The probability an attacker is *not* tall, which is 85% (0.85) based on information a.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to plug into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
