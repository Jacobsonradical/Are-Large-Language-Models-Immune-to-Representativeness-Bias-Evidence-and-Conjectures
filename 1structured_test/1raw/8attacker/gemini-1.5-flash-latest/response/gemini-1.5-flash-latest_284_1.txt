Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the base rate of attackers being short or tall.  Even though the population is split 50/50, attackers are disproportionately short (85% vs. 15% tall).
* **Information b:** This gives us the witness's accuracy. They are good at identifying height (80% correct), but they also make mistakes (20% incorrect).

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

* **P(Tall | Witness says Tall):** The probability the attacker is tall given the witness says they are tall.
* **P(Witness says Tall | Tall):** The probability the witness says someone is tall given they actually are tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(Tall):**  The prior probability of an attacker being tall (15% from information a).
* **P(Witness says Tall):** The probability the witness says someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. This requires us to consider both true positives and false positives.

**Let's calculate:**

1. **P(Witness says Tall):**
    *  P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 
    *  P(Witness says Tall | Short) * P(Short) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
    *  P(Witness says Tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

2. **Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:**

    P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = [P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness says Tall)

    P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 

    P(Tall | Witness says Tall) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
