Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable, but their judgment is not perfect. They are more likely to correctly identify someone's height, but there's a chance they might get it wrong.
* **Information b:** This tells us that even though the population is split evenly, most attackers are shorter than 185 cm. This is important because it biases our overall probability.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information from the witness and the population statistics. 

* **Let's define the events:**
    *  A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find:**  P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

* **Bayes' Theorem:**  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).

* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15%) based on the population statistics.

* **P(B):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:** 

{probability: 0.414}
