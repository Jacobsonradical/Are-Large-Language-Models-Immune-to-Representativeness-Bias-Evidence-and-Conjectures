Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the witness's accuracy in judging height under similar conditions. They are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Information b:** This provides information about the attacker population. While the overall population is split 50/50 in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter (85% vs 15% taller).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of an attacker being tall. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of actual height). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
   * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
