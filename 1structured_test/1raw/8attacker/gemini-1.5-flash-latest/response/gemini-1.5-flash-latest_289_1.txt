Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is evenly split in terms of height (185 cm or shorter vs. taller).  However, attackers are disproportionately shorter.
* **Information b:**  Gives us the witness's accuracy in judging height.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to consider both pieces of information and combine them.  

1. **Prior Probability:** Before the witness testimony, based on information "a", the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of attackers are that height).

2. **Likelihood:** The witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We need to consider how likely this statement is given the attacker's actual height.
    * If the attacker was truly 185 cm or taller, the witness would be correct 80% of the time.
    * If the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness would be wrong 20% of the time and say the attacker was taller.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  To combine the prior probability and the likelihood, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

   *  A: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
   *  B: Event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

   Bayes' Theorem:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

   Where:
   * P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement. This is what we want to find.
   * P(B|A): Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually taller (this is 80% from our likelihood).
   * P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is 15%).
   * P(B): Probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

4. **Calculating P(B):**
   We need to consider both scenarios:
   * Scenario 1: Attacker is taller (probability = 15%). Witness is correct (probability = 80%). This gives a probability of 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
   * Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter (probability = 85%). Witness is wrong (probability = 20%). This gives a probability of 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

   P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

5. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
