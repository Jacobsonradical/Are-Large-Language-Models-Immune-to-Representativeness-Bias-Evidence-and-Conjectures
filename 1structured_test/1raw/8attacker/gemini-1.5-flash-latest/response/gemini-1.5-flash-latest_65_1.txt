Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable, but there's a chance they misidentified the height.
* **Information b:**  Attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Let's define the events:

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are* that tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (from information b).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
