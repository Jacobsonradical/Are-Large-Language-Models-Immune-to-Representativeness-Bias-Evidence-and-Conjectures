Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us that the population is split roughly in half regarding height (under 185 cm vs. 185 cm or taller).  It also gives us the distribution of attackers within these height categories.
* **Information b:** Tells us about the witness's accuracy in judging height under similar conditions. We need to combine this with information a to assess the reliability of the witness's statement.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information from the witness and the general population statistics to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

* **Let's define the events:**
    *  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    *  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We need to find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

* **Bayes' Theorem:**
    P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

1. **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.  This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).

2. **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is roughly 50% (from information a, as the population is split roughly in half).

3. **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). This is the overall chance of the witness saying "taller" and requires a bit more calculation:

    * **P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)**
    * **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (when they're actually shorter). This is the witness's error rate, 20% (from information b).
    * **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also roughly 50% (from information a).

**Calculating P(B):**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Putting it all together:**

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:** {probability: 0.8} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.**
