Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is roughly split.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but also highlights the possibility of error.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information from both sources. We can use Bayes' Theorem for this:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are that height. This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% from information "a".
* **P(B):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This requires a bit more work. 

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider the two possibilities:

1. **Witness is correct:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the witness identifies them correctly (80% chance).
2. **Witness is wrong:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as taller (20% chance).

Since the population is roughly split, we can assume a 50% chance of the attacker being shorter or taller.

Therefore:

* P(B) = (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.5

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.5 
P(A|B) = 0.24 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
