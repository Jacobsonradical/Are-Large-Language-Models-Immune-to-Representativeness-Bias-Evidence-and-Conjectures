Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm even though the population is split 50/50 on height.  
* **Information b:** This tells us the witness is a reliable source of information, but not perfect. They are right 80% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information from both sources to get the most accurate estimate.  Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Prior Probability:** Based on information "a", the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of attackers in that height range are taller).

2. **Likelihood:** Information "b" gives us the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller.  This likelihood is 80%.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:**  We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the prior probability and the likelihood to get the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement):

   * Posterior Probability = (Likelihood * Prior Probability) / (Likelihood * Prior Probability) + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior Probability)

   * Posterior Probability = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
   * Posterior Probability = 0.12 / 0.34 
   * Posterior Probability â‰ˆ 0.353

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the information, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.353 (or about 35.3%).
