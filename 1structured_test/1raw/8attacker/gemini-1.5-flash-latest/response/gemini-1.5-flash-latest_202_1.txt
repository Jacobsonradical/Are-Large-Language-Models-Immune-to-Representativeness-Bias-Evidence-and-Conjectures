Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the likelihood of an attacker being in each height category.
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Logic:**

We need to combine the information from the population distribution, the witness's accuracy, and the witness's statement to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

**Calculation:**

1. **Prior Probability:** Since the population is roughly split, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

2. **Likelihoods:**
    *  Likelihood of the witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually taller: 0.8 (80% accuracy)
    *  Likelihood of the witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter: 0.2 (20% error)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's statement:

   P(Attacker Taller | Witness Says Taller) = [P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller) * P(Attacker Taller)] / P(Witness Says Taller)

   To calculate P(Witness Says Taller), we need the law of total probability:

   P(Witness Says Taller) =  P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller) * P(Attacker Taller) + P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Shorter) * P(Attacker Shorter)

4. **Putting it Together:**

   * P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Taller) = 0.8
   * P(Attacker Taller) = 0.5
   * P(Witness Says Taller | Attacker Shorter) = 0.2
   * P(Attacker Shorter) = 0.5

   Therefore:

   * P(Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

   Now we can calculate the final probability:

   P(Attacker Taller | Witness Says Taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
