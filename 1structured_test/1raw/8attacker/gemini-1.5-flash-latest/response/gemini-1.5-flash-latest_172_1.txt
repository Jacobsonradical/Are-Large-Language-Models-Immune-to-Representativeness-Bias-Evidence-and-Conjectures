Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  The witness has a good track record (80% accuracy) of identifying height under similar conditions. However, this accuracy is relative to a 50/50 split in the population. 
* **Information b:** The actual attacker population is skewed.  There are far more short attackers (85%) than tall attackers (15%).

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to combine the witness's accuracy with the actual attacker population distribution.  

1. **Witness's Accuracy:** The witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, but also incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

2. **Population Distribution:**  We know 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

3. **Combining Information:**

   * **Scenario 1:**  The witness correctly identifies a tall attacker (80% accuracy * 15% attacker population = 12% chance).
   * **Scenario 2:**  The witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall (20% inaccuracy * 85% attacker population = 17% chance).

4. **Total Probability:**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is the chance of Scenario 1 occurring: 12% 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.12}
