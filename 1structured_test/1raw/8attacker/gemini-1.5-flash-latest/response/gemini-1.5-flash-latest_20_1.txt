Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the population distribution of heights is roughly 50/50. However, attackers are more likely to be shorter than average.
* **Information b:** The witness is generally good at judging height, but they make mistakes.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as tall given they *are* tall. This is 80% from information b.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall.  This is 15% from information a.
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying someone as tall (this can happen in two ways):
    * The person is tall, and the witness is correct (P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
    * The person is short, and the witness is wrong (P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
