Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm even though the population is evenly split.  
* **Information b:** The witness is generally reliable but has a significant error rate.

**Logic:**

We need to consider both the witness's testimony and the general statistical information about attackers. 

1. **Prior Probability:**  Based on information "a", the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (since 15% of attackers are that tall).

2. **Likelihood:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This has a likelihood of 80% if the attacker is truly that tall (based on the witness's accuracy).

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the prior probability and the likelihood to get the posterior probability (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony):

   *  P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)

   * We need to calculate P(Witness Says Tall), which is the probability the witness would say someone is tall regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated by considering the probability of the witness being correct (80%) and incorrect (20%) in each of the height categories:

     * P(Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.22 (This means there's a 22% chance the witness would say someone is tall regardless of their height)

4. **Calculation:**

   * P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 = 0.545

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.545} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.**
