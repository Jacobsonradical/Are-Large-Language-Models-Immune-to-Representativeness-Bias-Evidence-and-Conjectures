Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Given Information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information b).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is actually that tall (from information a).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is actually shorter (from information a).

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**4. Calculate P(B):**

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need to calculate P(B), the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
