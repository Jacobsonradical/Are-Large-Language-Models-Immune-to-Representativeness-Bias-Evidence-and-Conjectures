Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  This tells us the general population distribution of heights (roughly equal).  Importantly, it tells us the attacker population is skewed – far more attackers are shorter than 185 cm.
* **Information b:** This gives us information about the witness's reliability. The witness is good, but not perfect, at judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) given new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define our events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies someone as tall *given* they *are* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (from information a, since attackers are skewed towards being shorter).
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying someone as tall.  This is trickier, and we'll calculate it using the Law of Total Probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall *given* they are *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, 20%.
    * P(not A): The probability of the attacker *not* being tall, which is 85% (from information a).

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as tall, the initial probability of an attacker being tall was quite low.  The witness's accuracy helps increase the probability, but it remains below 50%.
