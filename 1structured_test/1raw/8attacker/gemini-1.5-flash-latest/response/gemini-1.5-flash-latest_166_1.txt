Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us about the general population and the tendency of attackers to be shorter.
* **Information b:**  Provides information about the witness's accuracy in identifying height. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are actually 185 cm or taller. From information b, this is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  From information a, this is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B| not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B| not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they are actually shorter. From information b, this is 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. From information a, this is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug all the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
