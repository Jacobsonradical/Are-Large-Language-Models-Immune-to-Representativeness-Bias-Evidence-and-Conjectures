Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 between people shorter and taller than 185cm.  However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs 15%). 
* **Information b:**  A witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This witness has an 80% accuracy rate in judging height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's testimony.

* **Let's define the events:**
    * **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    * **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

* **We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the proportion of attackers who are tall in the population, which is 0.15 (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A): Probability the witness identifies as tall given the attacker is *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate, 0.2.
    * P(not A): Probability of the attacker *not* being tall, which is 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
    * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.48.**
