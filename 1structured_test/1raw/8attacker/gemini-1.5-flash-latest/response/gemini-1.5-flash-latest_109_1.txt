Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is split evenly between those heights.
* **Information b:** Gives us a witness's accuracy in judging height, but their identification suggests the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

**Combining the Information**

We need to consider both pieces of information.  The witness's identification is important, but we also know that shorter attackers are more common. Here's a way to approach the problem:

1. **Prior Probability:**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%) since the population is evenly split.

2. **Likelihood:** This is the probability of the witness identifying someone as taller than 185 cm given their actual height.
    * If the attacker is truly taller than 185 cm, the witness will identify them correctly 80% of the time.
    * If the attacker is truly shorter than 185 cm, the witness will mistakenly identify them as taller 20% of the time.

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony:

   ```
   P(Taller | Witness) = [P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness)
   ```

   Where:
   * P(Taller | Witness): Probability of the attacker being taller given the witness's testimony.
   * P(Witness | Taller):  Probability of the witness identifying someone as taller given they are actually taller (0.8).
   * P(Taller): Prior probability of the attacker being taller (0.5).
   * P(Witness): Probability of the witness identifying someone as taller (needs to be calculated).

4. **Calculating P(Witness):**

   * P(Witness) = [P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller)] + [P(Witness | Shorter) * P(Shorter)]
   * P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5 

5. **Putting it together:**

   ```
   P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8
   ```

**Estimate**

Therefore, based on the given information, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

**{probability: 0.8}**
