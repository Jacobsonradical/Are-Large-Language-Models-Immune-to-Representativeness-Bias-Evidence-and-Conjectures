Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Let's break down the information:**

* **Event A:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. 

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(A|B):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they *are* 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(B):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height). We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)
    * P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Putting it all together:**

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
