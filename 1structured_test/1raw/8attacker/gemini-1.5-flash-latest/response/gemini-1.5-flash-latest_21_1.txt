Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** The witness is a good judge of height, but not perfect. They correctly identify height 80% of the time.
* **Information b:** While the population is split evenly between people taller and shorter than 185cm, attackers are more likely to be shorter (85% vs. 15% taller).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker being tall) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define:

*  **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the population of attackers.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall, regardless of their actual height. This is calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
