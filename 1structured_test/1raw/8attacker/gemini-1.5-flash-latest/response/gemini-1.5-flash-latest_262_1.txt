Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights and the distribution of attackers within those height categories.
* **Information b:**  Tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions.

**Steps to Calculate the Probability**

1. **Prior Probability:** Since the population is split equally between people shorter than 185 cm and taller, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

2. **Likelihoods:**
   * **Likelihood of Witness Saying "Taller" Given the Attacker is Taller (True Positive):** 80% (from information b)
   * **Likelihood of Witness Saying "Taller" Given the Attacker is Shorter (False Positive):** 20% (from information b)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We'll use Bayes' Theorem to combine the prior probability and likelihoods to calculate the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being taller given the witness's statement).

   * Let  'A' be the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
   * Let 'W' be the event of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

   * Bayes' Theorem: 
     P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

   *  We need to calculate P(W), the probability of the witness saying "taller". This can be done using the law of total probability:
     P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     P(W) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

4. **Calculate Posterior Probability:**
   P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.8}
