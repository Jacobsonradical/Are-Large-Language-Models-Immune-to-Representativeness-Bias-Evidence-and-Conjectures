Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **a:**  The witness is generally reliable in judging height (80% accuracy). However, their judgment is not perfect.
* **b:**  While the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter than 185 cm. 

**Calculations:**

1. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness correctly identifies 80% of people's heights. This means there's a 20% chance they misidentify someone's height.

2. **Attacker Population:** 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Estimating the Probability:**

We need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the actual distribution of attackers:

* **Scenario 1:** The witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is likely to happen 80% of the time. However, only 15% of attackers are actually in this category. 
* **Scenario 2:** The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is likely to happen 20% of the time. In this case, they're misidentifying someone who is actually under 185 cm (85% of attackers).

**Combining the Information:**

* **Probability of a true positive:** 0.80 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (actual proportion of taller attackers) = 0.12
* **Probability of a false positive:** 0.20 (witness error) * 0.85 (actual proportion of shorter attackers) = 0.17

**Final Estimate:**

The overall probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the probability of a true positive divided by the sum of the probabilities of true positive and false positive:

0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
