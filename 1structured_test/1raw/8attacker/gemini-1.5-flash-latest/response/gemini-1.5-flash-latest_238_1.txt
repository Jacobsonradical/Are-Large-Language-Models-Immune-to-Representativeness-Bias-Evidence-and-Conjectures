Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and the likelihood of attackers being in each height group. 
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the witness identified them as such (event B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from information b: 80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a: 15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This requires calculating the probability of a correct identification and an incorrect identification.

**Calculating P(B)**

* **Correct Identification:** P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Incorrect Identification:** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 
* **P(B):**  0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
