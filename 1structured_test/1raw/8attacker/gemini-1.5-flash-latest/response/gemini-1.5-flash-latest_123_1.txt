Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and how likely an attacker is to be in each height group.
* **Information b:**  Tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying heights under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Let:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are. From information b, this is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information a, this is 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height).  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter. From information b, this is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% (0.85) from information a.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
