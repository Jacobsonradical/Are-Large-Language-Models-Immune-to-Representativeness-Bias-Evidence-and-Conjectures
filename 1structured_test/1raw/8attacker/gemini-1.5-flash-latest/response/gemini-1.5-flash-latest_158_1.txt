Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the witness's accuracy in judging height, but not the true proportion of attackers above or below 185 cm.
* **Information b:** Provides the actual distribution of attacker heights in the population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the witness identifies the attacker as tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is the proportion of tall attackers in the population: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation:**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
