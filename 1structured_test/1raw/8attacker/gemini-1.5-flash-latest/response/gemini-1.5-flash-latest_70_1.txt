Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that we know the witness's testimony and the population distribution of attackers.  

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (0.15) based on the population distribution.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

   * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, 20% (0.2).
   * P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (0.85).

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
