Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:**  The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from "a").
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not (from "a").
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (from "b").
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that an attacker is under 185 cm (from "b").

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
       = 0.12 / 0.30
       = 0.4

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.4.**

**{probability: 0.4}**
