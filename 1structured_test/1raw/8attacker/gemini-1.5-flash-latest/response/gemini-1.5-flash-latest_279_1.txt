Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  They are 80% accurate, but this is a general accuracy, not specific to the attacker.
* **Information b:**  Tells us about the attacker population.  Even though there are roughly equal numbers of people above and below 185cm, most attackers are actually shorter than 185cm.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the witness's accuracy with the attacker population information.  We'll use Bayes' Theorem for this:

* **Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".**
* **Let B be the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller *given* they actually are 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%. So, P(B|A) = 0.8
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given in information b: 15%. So, P(A) = 0.15
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated.

**Calculating P(B):**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate: 20%. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2
* **P(not A):** The probability of an attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller. This is 85% from information b. So, P(not A) = 0.85

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
