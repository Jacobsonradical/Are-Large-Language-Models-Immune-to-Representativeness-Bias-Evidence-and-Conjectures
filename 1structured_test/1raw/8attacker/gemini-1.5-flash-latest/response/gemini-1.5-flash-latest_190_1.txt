Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the population distribution of heights and the relative frequency of attackers in each height category. 
* **Information b:** Provides the accuracy of the witness's height estimation under similar conditions.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to combine the information to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. We can use Bayes' Theorem for this:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness identified them as such (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from information b, this is 80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information a, this is 15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
