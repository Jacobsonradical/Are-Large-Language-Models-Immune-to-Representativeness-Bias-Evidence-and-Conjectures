Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** This tells us the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm, even though the population is evenly split.  
* **Information b:**  The witness is generally reliable but not perfect in identifying height.

**Combining the Information**

We need to combine the information from the population distribution, the witness's reliability, and the attacker's height to estimate the probability.

**Calculation**

1. **Population Proportion:** Since the population is evenly split, the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

2. **Witness Reliability:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.  This means there's a 20% chance they misidentified the attacker's height.

3. **Combined Probability:** We need to consider the witness's reliability in the context of the population proportion. The witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. There are two ways this could have happened:

    * **Correct Identification:** The attacker is truly 185 cm or taller (with a 0.5 probability) and the witness identified them correctly (with an 80% probability). This probability is 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4.
    * **Incorrect Identification:** The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (with a 0.5 probability) and the witness misidentified them (with a 20% probability). This probability is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

4. **Overall Probability:** To get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the relative likelihood of the two scenarios above.  Since the probability of a correct identification is higher (0.4) than the probability of a misidentification (0.1), the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is greater than 0.5. 

**Estimating the Probability**

To get a rough estimate, we can use a weighted average:

* **Weight 0.4** (probability of correct identification) for the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* **Weight 0.1** (probability of incorrect identification) for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

The estimated probability is then: (0.4 * 1) + (0.1 * 0) = 0.4 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4} 

**Important Note:** This is an estimate based on the information provided.  A more precise calculation would require more information about the witness's reliability in identifying different heights and the specific distribution of heights in the attacker population.
