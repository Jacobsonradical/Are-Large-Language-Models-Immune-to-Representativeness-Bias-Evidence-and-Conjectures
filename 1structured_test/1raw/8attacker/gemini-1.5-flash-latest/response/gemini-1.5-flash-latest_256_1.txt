Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**2. Information from the Problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Witness correctly identifies height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (Witness incorrectly identifies height when the attacker is under 185 cm)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B):

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
```

**4. Calculate P(B):**

```
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 
```

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.41} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
