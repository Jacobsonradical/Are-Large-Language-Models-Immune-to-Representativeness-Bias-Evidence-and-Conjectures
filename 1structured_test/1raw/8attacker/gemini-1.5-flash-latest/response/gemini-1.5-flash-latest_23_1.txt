Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find:** P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (given the population split).
* **P(A') = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
* **P(B|A') = 0.20:** The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
