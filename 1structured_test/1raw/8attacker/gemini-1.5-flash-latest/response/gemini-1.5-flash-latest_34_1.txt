Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information "a":** This tells us the base rate of attackers in the population.  While the population is split 50/50, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% vs 15%).
* **Information "b":** This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, but it's important to note they are more likely to be correct when the person is actually the height they claim.

**Calculating the Probability**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

**P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness Says Tall)**

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability we want to find – the probability the attacker was tall given the witness said so.
* **P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall):** This is the witness's accuracy when the attacker is actually tall, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** This is the base rate of tall attackers in the population, which is 15% (0.15).
* **P(Witness Says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying someone is tall, regardless of their actual height. This requires a bit more calculation:
    *  P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Short) * P(Attacker Short) + P(Witness Says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall) 
    *  (0.2 * 0.85) + (0.8 * 0.15) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker Tall | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
                                         = 0.12 / 0.29
                                         ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

While the witness said the attacker was tall, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is still only about 41.4%. This is because the base rate of tall attackers is much lower than short attackers, even though the witness is more likely to be correct about height when the person is actually tall.
