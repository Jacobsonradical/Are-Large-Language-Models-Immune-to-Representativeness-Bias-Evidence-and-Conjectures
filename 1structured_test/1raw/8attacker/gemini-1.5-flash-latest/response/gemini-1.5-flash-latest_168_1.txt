Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the general population distribution of height (roughly equal) and the distribution of attackers by height (85% shorter, 15% taller).
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is the overall probability of the witness saying "taller," which can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker is actually taller, and the witness is correct (80% of the time * 15% of the population = 12%).
    * The attacker is actually shorter, and the witness is wrong (20% of the time * 85% of the population = 17%).

Therefore:
* P(B) = 12% + 17% = 29%

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's identification, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
