Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the distribution of attackers within those heights (85% shorter, 15% taller).
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is well-suited for Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of event A (attacker being 185 cm or taller) given event B (witness identified attacker as taller).  This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller given that the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being taller. This is 0.15 (from information a).
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as taller. This is a bit more complex and we'll calculate it below.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider two scenarios contributing to the witness identifying the attacker as taller:

1. **Attacker is actually taller:**  Probability is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
2. **Attacker is actually shorter:** Probability is P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.**
