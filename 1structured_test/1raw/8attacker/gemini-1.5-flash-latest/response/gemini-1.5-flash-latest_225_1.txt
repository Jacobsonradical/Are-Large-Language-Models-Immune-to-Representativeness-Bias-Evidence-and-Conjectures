Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact 1 (a):**  The population is roughly split 50/50 for people shorter and taller than 185 cm. However, attackers disproportionately come from the shorter group (85% vs. 15%).
* **Fact 2 (b):** The witness has a good track record but isn't perfect. They are right 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This situation is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem is helpful to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.

* **Let's define events:**
    * A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
    * B: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
    * W: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 

* **We want to find:** P(A|W) - The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

* **Bayes' Theorem:** 
   P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

   Where:
   * P(W|A): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they *are* 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy, 80%).
   * P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the population proportion, 0.15).
   * P(W): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller (this needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(W)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|B) * P(B)

* P(W|B): Probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are *not* 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's error rate, 20%).
* P(B): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (this is the population proportion, 0.85).

Therefore:
P(W) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we have all the pieces to calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 41.4%.  This is higher than the prior probability of 15% because the witness's testimony, though not perfect, adds some weight to the possibility.
