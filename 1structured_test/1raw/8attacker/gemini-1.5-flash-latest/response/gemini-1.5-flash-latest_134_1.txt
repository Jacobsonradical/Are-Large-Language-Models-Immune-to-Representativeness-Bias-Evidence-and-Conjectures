Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights (roughly equal) and the attack distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller). 
* **Information b:** Tells us the witness's accuracy in identifying height (80% correct, 20% incorrect).

**Reasoning:**

1. **Base Rate:** We start with the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on information "a".

2. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. However, this accuracy applies to both correctly identifying someone as taller and incorrectly identifying someone as taller.

3. **Considering Incorrect Identification:**  The witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time. This means there's a 20% chance they might identify someone shorter than 185 cm as being taller.

**Calculation:**

We need to consider both the witness's correct identification and their incorrect identification in the context of the base rate.

* **Correct Identification:** 80% of the time the witness is correct, so 80% of the 15% taller attackers will be correctly identified as taller. This is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

* **Incorrect Identification:** 20% of the time the witness is incorrect.  Since the population is split 50/50 in height, 20% of the 50% of people shorter than 185 cm will be incorrectly identified as taller. This is 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.10

* **Total Probability:**  To get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we add the probability of correct identification and the probability of incorrect identification.  This gives us 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.22}
