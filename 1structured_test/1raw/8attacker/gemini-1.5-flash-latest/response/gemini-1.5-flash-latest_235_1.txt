Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is good at judging height, but they are not perfect.  Their accuracy helps us understand how likely it is that an individual *actually* meets the witness's description. 
* **Information b:**  This tells us that while the population is evenly split in terms of height, attackers are more likely to be shorter. This is crucial because it influences our prior belief about the attacker's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the attacker population statistics:

```
P(Taller | Witness) = [P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller)] / P(Witness)
```

Where:

* **P(Taller | Witness):** The probability the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the witness's statement. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness | Taller):** The probability the witness would identify someone as taller than 185 cm given they *are* actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(Taller):** The prior probability of an attacker being taller than 185 cm. This is 15% from the population data.
* **P(Witness):**  The overall probability of the witness making their statement. This can be calculated as a weighted average of the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are tall and the probability of the witness identifying someone as tall given they are short. 

**Calculating P(Witness)**

```
P(Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) * P(Shorter) 
```

* **P(Witness | Shorter):**  The probability the witness would identify someone as taller than 185 cm given they are *not* actually taller. This is the witness's error rate, 20%.
* **P(Shorter):**  The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% from the population data.

**Putting it Together**

1. **Calculate P(Witness):** 
   * P(Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:**
   * P(Taller | Witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
