Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:** Tells us about the witness's accuracy in judging height.  They are generally reliable, but there's a chance they could be wrong.
* **Information b:**  Tells us about the overall distribution of attacker heights in the population.  While the population is split evenly in terms of height, most attackers are actually shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to combine the information from both sources.  We can use Bayes' Theorem for this:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* that the witness identified them as such (this is what we want to find).
* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would identify someone as 185 cm or taller *given* that they actually are that tall (this is the witness's accuracy: 80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is 15%, from information b).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.  This can be calculated as a weighted average of the witness's accuracy and the chance of misidentifying someone:  (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
