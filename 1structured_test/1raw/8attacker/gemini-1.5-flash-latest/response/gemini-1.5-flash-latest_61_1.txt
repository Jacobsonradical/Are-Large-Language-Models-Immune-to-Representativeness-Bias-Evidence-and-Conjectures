Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the distribution of heights in the general population and the relative frequency of attackers in each height category.
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Defining Our Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating the Probabilities**

1. **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (from information a - the population is split evenly).
2. **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information b - witness accuracy).
3. **P(B|not A):** The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (from information b - witness error).
4. **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.5 (from information a).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This is done using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
