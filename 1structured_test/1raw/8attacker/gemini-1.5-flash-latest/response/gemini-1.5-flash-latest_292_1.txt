Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (20% error).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% of attackers).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being under 185 cm (85% of attackers).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.34
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.353}
