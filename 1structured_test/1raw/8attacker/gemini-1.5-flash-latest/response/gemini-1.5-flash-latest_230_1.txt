Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us the population distribution of heights and the relative frequency of attackers within those height groups.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker's height) given new evidence (witness's testimony):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller (B) given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (A). This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 50% (since the population is roughly split).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This requires a bit more calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone taller AND the probability of them incorrectly identifying someone shorter:

* **P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]** 
   * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter as taller (20%).
   * P(not A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (50%).

**Putting it Together**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8}
