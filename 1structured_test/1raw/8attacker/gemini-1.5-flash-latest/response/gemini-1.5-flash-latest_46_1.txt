Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that the population is roughly split 50/50 in terms of height (below and above 185 cm).  It also gives us the proportion of attackers within each height group.
* **Information b:** Gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height.  Crucially, it tells us that their accuracy is the same for both height groups (shorter and taller).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness's testimony. Let's define the following events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:**  Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of witness identifying someone as taller *given* they are taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller. From information a, this is 15% (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying someone as taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculation**

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
