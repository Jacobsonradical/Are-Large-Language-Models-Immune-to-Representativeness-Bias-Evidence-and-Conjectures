Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact a:**  The population is roughly split 50/50 between those under 185cm and those 185cm or taller. However, attackers are disproportionately shorter (85% under 185cm). This tells us that being short is a strong indicator of being an attacker, but doesn't directly tell us the probability of a tall person being the attacker. 
* **Fact b:**  The witness is generally good at judging height (80% accuracy). However, we need to consider how this accuracy applies to the specific situation of the attack.

**Calculating the Probability**

1. **Base Rate:**  Since the population is roughly split 50/50, the base rate (prior probability) of an attacker being 185cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

2. **Witness Accuracy:**  The witness is correct 80% of the time. This means:
    * If the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will say so.
    * If the attacker is actually under 185cm, there's a 20% chance the witness will incorrectly say they are 185cm or taller.

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem:**  We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our probability based on the witness's testimony:

   * **P(A|B):** Probability the attacker is 185cm or taller (A) given the witness said so (B). This is what we want to find.
   * **P(B|A):** Probability the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller given the attacker actually is (80%).
   * **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (50%).
   * **P(B):** Overall probability the witness says the attacker is 185cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
      * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
      * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

   * **Bayes' Theorem:**  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
      * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.8} 

**Explanation:** Based on the witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller increases to 80%.
