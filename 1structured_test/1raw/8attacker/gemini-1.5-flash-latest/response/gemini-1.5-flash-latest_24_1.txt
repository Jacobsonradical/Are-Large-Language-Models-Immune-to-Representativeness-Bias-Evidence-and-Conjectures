Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us the distribution of heights in the general population and the relative likelihood of an attacker being in each height group. 
* **Information b:** Provides the witness's accuracy in identifying height in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. 

Let:

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (from information b).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 15% (from information a).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
* **P(not A):** Probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller. This is 85% (from information a).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

Finally, we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
