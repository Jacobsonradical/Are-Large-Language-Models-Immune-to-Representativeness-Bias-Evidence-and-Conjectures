Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **¬B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(B|A), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(B|A) = [P(A|B) * P(B)] / P(A)

**3. Break down the terms:**

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that tall. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(A):** The probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of actual height). We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**4. Calculate P(A):**

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|¬B) * P(¬B)

* **P(A|¬B):** The probability the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter. This is 0.2 (20% error).
* **P(¬B):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.85 (given in the problem).

Therefore:

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**5. Calculate P(B|A):**

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
