Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **a:**  This tells us the witness's reliability. They are good at judging height, but not perfect.
* **b:** This provides information about the relative frequency of attackers in each height category.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement.

Let's define:

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:**  Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is 80% (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% (from the attacker population statistics).
* **P(B):**  Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as tall (regardless of their actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41}
