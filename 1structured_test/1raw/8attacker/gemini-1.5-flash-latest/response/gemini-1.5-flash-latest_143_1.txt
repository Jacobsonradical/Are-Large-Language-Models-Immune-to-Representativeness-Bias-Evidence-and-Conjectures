Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:** Tells us that there's a roughly equal distribution of people shorter than 185 cm and taller than 185 cm in the general population.  However, attackers are more likely to be shorter (85% vs 15%).
* **Information b:**  Provides the witness's accuracy in judging height. They are correct 80% of the time, and incorrect 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the base rate from information "a", which is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
