Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information "a"**: This tells us the base rate of attackers being under 185 cm (85%) or 185 cm or taller (15%).
* **Information "b"**: This gives us the witness's accuracy in identifying height, which is 80% correct and 20% incorrect.

**Calculating the Probability:**

We need to consider both the base rate and the witness's accuracy. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Probability of a tall attacker (185 cm or taller) based on the base rate:** 0.15 (15%)

2. **Probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker:** 0.8 (80%)

3. **Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall:** 0.2 (20%)

4. **Probability of a short attacker being incorrectly identified as tall:** 0.85 (85% base rate of short attackers) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.17

5. **To get the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement, we use Bayes' Theorem:**

   ```
   P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = [P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness says Tall) 
   ```

   Where:

   * P(Tall | Witness says Tall) is the probability the attacker is tall given the witness said so.
   * P(Witness says Tall | Tall) is the probability the witness says tall given the attacker is tall (0.8).
   * P(Tall) is the base rate of tall attackers (0.15).
   * P(Witness says Tall) is the overall probability the witness says tall, which can be calculated as:  
     *  P(Witness says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness says Tall | Short) * P(Short) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

6. **Putting it all together:**

   ```
   P(Tall | Witness says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.41 
   ```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.41 or 41%.
