Here's how to break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Information a:**  The witness is generally reliable at judging height, but there's a significant chance of error.
* **Information b:** While the population is split evenly in terms of height, attackers are statistically more likely to be shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider both the witness's reliability and the population distribution of attackers. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Probability of Witness Saying "Tall" Given a Tall Attacker:** The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness saying "tall" given a tall attacker is 0.8.

2. **Probability of Witness Saying "Tall" Given a Short Attacker:** The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness saying "tall" given a short attacker is 0.2.

3. **Prior Probability of a Tall Attacker:** The probability of an attacker being tall is 15% (given in information b).

4. **Prior Probability of a Short Attacker:** The probability of an attacker being short is 85% (given in information b).

5. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**  We can combine this information using Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of a tall attacker given the witness statement:

   ```
   P(Tall Attacker | Witness Says Tall) = [P(Witness Says Tall | Tall Attacker) * P(Tall Attacker)] / P(Witness Says Tall) 
   ```

   To find P(Witness Says Tall), we need to consider both cases:

   * P(Witness Says Tall | Tall Attacker) * P(Tall Attacker) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
   * P(Witness Says Tall | Short Attacker) * P(Short Attacker) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

   Therefore, P(Witness Says Tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

   Finally, we can calculate the probability we're looking for:

   P(Tall Attacker | Witness Says Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Even though the witness identified the attacker as tall, the probability of the attacker actually being tall is only about 41.4% due to the witness's error rate and the fact that short attackers are more prevalent in this population.
