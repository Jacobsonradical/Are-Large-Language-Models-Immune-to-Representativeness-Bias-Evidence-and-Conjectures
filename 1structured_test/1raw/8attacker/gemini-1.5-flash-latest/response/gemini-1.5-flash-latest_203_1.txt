Here's how we can break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Fact a:**  This tells us the population is roughly split 50/50 between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, attackers in this category are disproportionately shorter (85% under 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller).
* **Fact b:**  A witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We know this witness is 80% accurate in similar conditions.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness's statement). 

Let's define:

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:**  Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. From fact a, this is 0.15 (15% of attackers are tall).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness saying "tall".  We need to consider both scenarios: 
    * Witness is correct (attacker is tall): P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness is wrong (attacker is short): P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.414.
