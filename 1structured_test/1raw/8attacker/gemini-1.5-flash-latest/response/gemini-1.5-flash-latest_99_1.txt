Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Information a:**  Tells us that there's a roughly equal distribution of people shorter and taller than 185 cm in the general population. However, the attacker pool is skewed, with a significantly higher proportion of attackers being shorter than 185 cm. 
* **Information b:** Provides us with the witness's accuracy in judging height, but crucially, it's based on a sample with an equal distribution of heights, unlike the attacker pool. 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Attacker Pool:** We know the attacker pool is heavily skewed towards people shorter than 185 cm.  This means the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is low, even though it's 50% in the general population.

2. **Witness Accuracy:** The witness is good at judging height, but their accuracy is based on a balanced sample. This means their accuracy is less reliable when applied to the attacker pool, where the distribution of heights is different.

3. **Combining Information:** We need to combine the information about the attacker pool's height distribution with the witness's accuracy to get a better estimate. However, it's impossible to calculate an exact probability without further details like the actual size of the attacker pool.

**Estimate:**

Given the information provided, it's likely that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is **significantly lower than 0.5 (50%)** and probably closer to the 15% figure mentioned in information 'a'. 

**Why?**

Because the witness's accuracy is based on a balanced sample, their identification of someone as 185 cm or taller doesn't entirely overcome the strong likelihood that the attacker was actually shorter, given the information about the attacker pool.

**Conclusion:**

Without more specific data about the size of the attacker pool, it's difficult to provide a precise numerical probability. However, we can confidently estimate that the probability is significantly lower than 50%.

**Answer Format:**

{probability: **approximately 0.15 (15%)**,  but likely a bit higher than the attacker pool statistic due to the witness's observation}
