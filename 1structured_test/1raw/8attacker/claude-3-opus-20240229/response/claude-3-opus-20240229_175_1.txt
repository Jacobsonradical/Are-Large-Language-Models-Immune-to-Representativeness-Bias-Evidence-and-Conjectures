To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A|attack) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the additional information that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. We can update our prior probability P(A) using this information.

Updated P(A) = 1 - P(not A|attack) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, recalculating P(A|W) with the updated P(A):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
