To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as "T" and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as "W".

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|T) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not T) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = (P(W|T) × P(T)) / (P(W|T) × P(T) + P(W|not T) × P(not T))

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
