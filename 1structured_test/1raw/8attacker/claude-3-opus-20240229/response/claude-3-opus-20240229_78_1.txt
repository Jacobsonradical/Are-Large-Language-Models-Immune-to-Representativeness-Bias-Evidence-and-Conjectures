To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
