To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equal in size)
P(~A) = 0.5 (~ denotes the complement of an event)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(A|B) = ? (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8
