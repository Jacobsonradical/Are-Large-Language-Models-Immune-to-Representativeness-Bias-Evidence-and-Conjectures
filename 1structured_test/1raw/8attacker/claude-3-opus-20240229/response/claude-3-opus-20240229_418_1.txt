To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller:
P(A|W and attacker) = P(A|W) × P(A|attacker)
                     = 0.8 × 0.15
                     = 0.12
