To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.50 (the population is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A|attacker)) / (P(W|A) × P(A|attacker) + P(W|not A) × (1 - P(A|attacker)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
