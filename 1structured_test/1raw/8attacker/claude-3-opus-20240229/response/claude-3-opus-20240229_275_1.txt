To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally divided)
- P(~A) = 0.5 (~ denotes the complement of an event)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
