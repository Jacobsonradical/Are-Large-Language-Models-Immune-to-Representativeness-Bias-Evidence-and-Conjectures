To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
       = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the additional information that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can do this by updating our prior probability P(A) to P(A|attacker) = 0.15.

Updated calculation:
P(A|W, attacker) = P(W|A) * P(A|attacker) / [P(W|A) * P(A|attacker) + P(W|not A) * P(not A|attacker)]
                 = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
                 = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
                 = 0.12 / 0.29
                 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the additional information about attacker height distribution, is:

{probability: 0.414}
