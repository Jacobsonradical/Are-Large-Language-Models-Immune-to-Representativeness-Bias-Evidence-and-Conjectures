To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equal)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the additional information that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can do this by updating our prior probability P(A) to P(A|attacker) = 0.15.

Recalculating with the updated prior:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the additional information about attacker heights, is approximately 0.414.
