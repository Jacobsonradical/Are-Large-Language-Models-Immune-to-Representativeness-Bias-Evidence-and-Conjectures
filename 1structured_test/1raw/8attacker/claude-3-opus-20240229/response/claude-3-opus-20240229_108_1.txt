To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (roughly equal population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)
P(not A|A or not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.17)
       = 0.4 / 0.57
       â‰ˆ 0.7017

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.7017 or about 70.17%.
