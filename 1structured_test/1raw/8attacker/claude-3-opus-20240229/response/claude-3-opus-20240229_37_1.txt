To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.5 (half the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.5 (half the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Let's call this event C.

P(C) = 0.15

To incorporate this information, we can use the multiplication rule:
P(A and C) = P(A) * P(C|A)
           = 0.5 * 0.15
           = 0.075

Now, we can update our Bayes' theorem calculation using P(A and C) instead of P(A):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A and C)) / (P(B|A) * P(A and C) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.075) / (0.8 * 0.075 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.1)
       = 0.06 / 0.16
       = 0.375

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.375}
