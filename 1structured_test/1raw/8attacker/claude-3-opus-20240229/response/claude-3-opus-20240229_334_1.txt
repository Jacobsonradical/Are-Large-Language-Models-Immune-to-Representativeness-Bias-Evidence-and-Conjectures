To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
