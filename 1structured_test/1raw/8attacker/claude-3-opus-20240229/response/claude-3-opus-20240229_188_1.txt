To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as "T" (tall) and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as "W" (witness).

Given:
- P(W|T) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker)
- P(W|not T) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall)
- P(T) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = (P(W|T) * P(T)) / (P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T))

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
