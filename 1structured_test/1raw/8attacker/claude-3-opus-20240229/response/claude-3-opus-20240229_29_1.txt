To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
