To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A|W) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller when the witness identifies them as such)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
       = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
