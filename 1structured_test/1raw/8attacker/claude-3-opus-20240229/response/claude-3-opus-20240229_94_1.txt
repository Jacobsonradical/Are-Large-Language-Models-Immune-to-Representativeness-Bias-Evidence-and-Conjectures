To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)
P(not A|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the additional information about the attacker's height distribution. We can do this by multiplying the result by P(A|attacker) and normalizing:

P(A|W, attacker) = (P(A|W) * P(A|attacker)) / (P(A|W) * P(A|attacker) + P(not A|W) * P(not A|attacker))
                 = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
                 = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
                 = 0.12 / 0.29
                 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the attacker's height distribution, is approximately 0.414.
