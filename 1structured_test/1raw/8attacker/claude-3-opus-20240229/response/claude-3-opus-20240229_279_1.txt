To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal in size)
- P(~A) = 0.5 (complement of A)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(A|attack) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|~A) × P(~A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. We can do this by multiplying the prior probability P(A) by 0.15:

P(A|W, attack) = (P(W|A) × P(A) × 0.15) / (P(W|A) × P(A) × 0.15 + P(W|~A) × P(~A) × 0.85)
               = (0.8 × 0.5 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.5 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.5 × 0.85)
               = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.085)
               = 0.06 / 0.145
               ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the additional information about the attacker's height distribution, is approximately 0.414.
