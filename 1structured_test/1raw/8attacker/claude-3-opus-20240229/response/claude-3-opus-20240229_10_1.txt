To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the population of attackers)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
