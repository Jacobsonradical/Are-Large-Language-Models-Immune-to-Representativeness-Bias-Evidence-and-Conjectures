To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(not A|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the additional information that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. We can do this by multiplying the prior probability P(A) by 0.15 (the proportion of attackers 185 cm or taller).

Updated calculation:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × (0.5 × 0.15)) / (0.8 × (0.5 × 0.15) + 0.2 × (0.5 × 0.85))
       = 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.085)
       = 0.06 / 0.145
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the additional information about attacker height distribution, is approximately 0.414.
