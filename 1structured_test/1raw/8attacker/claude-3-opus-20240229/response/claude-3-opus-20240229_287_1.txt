To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|attacker) = P(A|W) × P(W|attacker) + P(A|not W) × P(not W|attacker)

We don't have the values for P(W|attacker) and P(not W|attacker), but we can estimate them based on the given information:

P(W|attacker) = P(W|A) × P(A|attacker) + P(W|not A) × P(not A|attacker)
              = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
              = 0.12 + 0.17
              = 0.29

P(not W|attacker) = 1 - P(W|attacker) = 1 - 0.29 = 0.71

Now we can calculate the overall probability:

P(A|attacker) = 0.8 × 0.29 + P(A|not W) × 0.71

We don't have the value for P(A|not W), but we can assume it to be very low since the witness didn't identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Let's assume P(A|not W) = 0.05.

P(A|attacker) = 0.8 × 0.29 + 0.05 × 0.71
              = 0.232 + 0.0355
              ≈ 0.268

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.268 or 26.8%.
