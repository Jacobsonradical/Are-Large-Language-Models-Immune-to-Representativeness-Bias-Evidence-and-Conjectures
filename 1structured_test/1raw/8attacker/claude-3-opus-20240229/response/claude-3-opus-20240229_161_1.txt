To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(not A|W) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / P(W)

Where P(W) = P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A)
= 0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5
= 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / 0.5
= 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
