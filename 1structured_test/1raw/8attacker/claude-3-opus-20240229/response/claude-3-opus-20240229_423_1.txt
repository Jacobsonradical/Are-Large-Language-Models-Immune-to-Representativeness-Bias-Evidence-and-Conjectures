To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal in size)
P(~A) = 0.5 (probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|~A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|~A) × P(~A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 or 80%.
