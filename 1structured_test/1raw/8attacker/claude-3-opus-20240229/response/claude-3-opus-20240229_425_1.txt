To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A|A or not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we multiply the probability by 0.15:

Final probability = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
