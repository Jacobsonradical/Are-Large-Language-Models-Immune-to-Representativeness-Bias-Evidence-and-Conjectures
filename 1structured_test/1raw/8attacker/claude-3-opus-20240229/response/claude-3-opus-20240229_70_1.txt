To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(not A|attack) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)
- P(A|attack) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A|attack)) / (P(W|A) × P(A|attack) + P(W|not A) × P(not A|attack))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
