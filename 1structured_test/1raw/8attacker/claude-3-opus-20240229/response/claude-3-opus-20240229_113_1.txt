To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
P(A) = 0.5 (population is roughly equal in size)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A|A or not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We need to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.17]
       = 0.4 / 0.57
       â‰ˆ 0.7017

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.7017 or about 70.2%.
