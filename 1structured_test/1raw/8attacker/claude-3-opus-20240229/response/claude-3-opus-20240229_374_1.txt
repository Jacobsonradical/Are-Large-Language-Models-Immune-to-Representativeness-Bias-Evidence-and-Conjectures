To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equally split between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(not A|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the fact that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. We can do this by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W and attacker) = P(A|W) * P(A|attacker)
                    = 0.8 * 0.15
                    = 0.12

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
