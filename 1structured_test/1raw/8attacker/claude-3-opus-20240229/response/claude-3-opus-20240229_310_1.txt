To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
