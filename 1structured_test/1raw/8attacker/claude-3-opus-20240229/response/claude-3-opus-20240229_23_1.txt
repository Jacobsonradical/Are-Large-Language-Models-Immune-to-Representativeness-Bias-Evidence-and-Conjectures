To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.5 (complement of P(A))

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 or 80%.
