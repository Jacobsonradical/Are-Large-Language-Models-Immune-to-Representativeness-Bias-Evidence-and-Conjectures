To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as "T" and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as "W".

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|T) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not T) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(T|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W) = (P(W|T) * P(T)) / (P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|not T) * P(not T))

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
