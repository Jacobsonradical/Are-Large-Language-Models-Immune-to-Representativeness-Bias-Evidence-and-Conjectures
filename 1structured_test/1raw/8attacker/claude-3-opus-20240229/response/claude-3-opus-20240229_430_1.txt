To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given information:
P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A|W) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller when identified by a witness)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / P(W)

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5
     = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5
       = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
