To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.50 (the population is roughly equal in size)
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.50

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.50) / (0.80 × 0.50 + 0.20 × 0.50)
       = 0.40 / (0.40 + 0.10)
       = 0.40 / 0.50
       = 0.80

Now, we need to account for the additional information about the attacker's height distribution. We can do this by multiplying the probability P(A|W) by the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker, P(A|attacker).

P(A|W, attacker) = P(A|W) × P(A|attacker)
                  = 0.80 × 0.15
                  = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
