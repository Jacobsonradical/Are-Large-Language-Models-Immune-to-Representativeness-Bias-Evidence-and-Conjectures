To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(W|A) = 0.80 (probability of the witness correctly identifying the height, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A)) / (P(W|A) × P(A) + P(W|not A) × P(not A))

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = (0.80 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
