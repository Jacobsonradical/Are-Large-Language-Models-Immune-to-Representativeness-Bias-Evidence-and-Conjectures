To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(A|attacker) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) × P(A|attacker)) / (P(W|A) × P(A|attacker) + P(W|not A) × (1 - P(A|attacker)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
