To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal in size)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.5 (the complement of A)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5)
       = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.8}
