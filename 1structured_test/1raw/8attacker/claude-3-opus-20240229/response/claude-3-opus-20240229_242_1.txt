To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Given:
- P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(not A|attacked) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (P(W|A) * P(A)) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A))

First, we need to update P(A) based on the information that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm:
P(A|attacked) = 1 - P(not A|attacked) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.414.
