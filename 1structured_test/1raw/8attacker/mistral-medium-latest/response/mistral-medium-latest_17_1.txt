To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's denote:

P(A|H) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
P(A|~H) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
P(H) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(A|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H|A) = [P(A|H) \* P(H)] / [P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|A) ≈ 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.17)
P(H|A) ≈ 0.18 / 0.35
P(H|A) ≈ 0.514

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.514.

The answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.514}
