To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the problem statement, we know:

1) P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
2) P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
3) P(not H) = 0.5
4) P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and mistakenly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.8

However, we also need to take into account the information that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller (information "a"). This is a prior probability based on the population of attackers, not the general population. So, we should update our initial estimate P(H) with this new information:

P'(H) = 0.15
P'(not H) = 0.85

Now, using the updated probabilities:

P'(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P'(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P'(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.413

So, the revised estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the prior information about attackers' heights is approximately 0.413.
