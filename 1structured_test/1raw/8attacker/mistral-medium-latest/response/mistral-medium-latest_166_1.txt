{probability: 0.27, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
2. Next, we need to find the probability that an attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to information b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. However, the witness is more likely to identify someone as 185 cm or taller even if they're not, due to their 20% error rate. So we have to take this into account as well.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said they were: P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness said 185+) = [P(Witness said 185+ | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+)] / P(Witness said 185+)
5. Plugging in the values, we get: P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness said 185+) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85] = 0.27 or 27%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.27.
