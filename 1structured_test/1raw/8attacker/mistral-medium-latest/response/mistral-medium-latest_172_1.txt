To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(W|H) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(W|~H) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information b.

Now we can calculate P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 1
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
