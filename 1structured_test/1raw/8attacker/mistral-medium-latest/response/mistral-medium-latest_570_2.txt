To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

From the given information:

P(A) = probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

P(B) = probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

P(¬A) = probability of an attacker not being 185 cm or taller = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

So, P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

{probability: 0.6667}
