To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(~T) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(~S) as the probability that the witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we know:

P(T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(~T) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(S|T) = 1.0 (If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always say so)
P(S|~T) = 0.2 (If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly say they are 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(~S|T) = 0.0 (The witness will never say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm if they are 185 cm or taller)
P(~S|~T) = 0.8 (If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will correctly say so 80% of the time)

First, let's find P(S):

P(S) = P(S and T) + P(S and ~T)
P(S) = P(S|T) * P(T) + P(S|~T) * P(~T)
P(S) = 1.0 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(S) = 0.15 + 0.17
P(S) = 0.32

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(T|S):

P(T|S) = P(S|T) * P(T) / P(S)
P(T|S) = 1.0 * 0.15 / 0.32
P(T|S) â‰ˆ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.469.
