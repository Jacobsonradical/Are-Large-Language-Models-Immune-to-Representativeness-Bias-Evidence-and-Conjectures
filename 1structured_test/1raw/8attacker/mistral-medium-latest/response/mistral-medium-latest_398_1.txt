{probability: 0.57, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

First, we have to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.5 due to the equal size of the populations.

Next, we have to take into account the witness's testimony, which is subject to error. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80%, the probability of the witness being correct is 0.8 when identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. Conversely, the probability of the witness being incorrect is 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5.
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.
- P(W|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- P(W|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.57

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.57.
