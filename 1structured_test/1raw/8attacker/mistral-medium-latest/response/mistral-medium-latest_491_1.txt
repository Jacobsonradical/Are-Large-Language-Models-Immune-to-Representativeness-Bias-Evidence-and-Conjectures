To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we can determine the prior probability P(A) from the information in statement a:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and P(B|¬A), the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. From statement b, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
