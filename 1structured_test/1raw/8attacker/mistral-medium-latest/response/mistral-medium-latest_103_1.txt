To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From information (a), we know that:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

From information (b), we know that:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889.

Let's format the answer as requested:
{probability: 0.8889}
