To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information a).
P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information b).
P(B|¬A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (from information b).
P(B) as the marginal probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is needed for Bayes' theorem.

First, let's find P(¬A), the prior probability of an attacker not being 185 cm or taller:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, let's find P(B). Using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.38

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.38.
