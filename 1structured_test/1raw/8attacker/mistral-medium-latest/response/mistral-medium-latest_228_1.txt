To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided. This involves the use of Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on the population.
P(B|A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
P(~B|~A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.8.
P(B) as the prior probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, irrespective of the attacker's actual height.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now that we have P(B), we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
