To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H - event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W - event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We need to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we know from information (a) that P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(W|¬H) = 0.2, where ¬H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From information (b), we can determine the prior probabilities: P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size) and P(¬H) = 0.5.

However, we also know that among attackers, 85% are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probabilities for the attackers specifically should be: P(H) = 0.15 and P(¬H) = 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.395.

The answer is: {probability: 0.395}
