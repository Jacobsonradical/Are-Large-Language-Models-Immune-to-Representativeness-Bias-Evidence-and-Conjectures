To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define some events:

* H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we can estimate the following probabilities:

* P(H): According to statement a, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, P(H) ≈ 0.5.
* P(W|H): This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From statement b, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(W|H) ≈ 0.8.
* P(W|¬H): This is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From statement b, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(W|¬H) ≈ 0.2.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Since P(H) ≈ 0.5 and P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) ≈ 0.5, we have:

P(W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
