To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Let's first define the following events:

A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(A|B). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

Now, we need to find P(B), which can be computed using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that:

P(A') = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and there are 50% of people shorter than 185 cm, so 0.2 = 0.2 \* 0.5)

Substituting these values:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, {probability: 0.8}
