To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let's define:
Event A as "The attacker is 185 cm or taller"
Event B as "The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8, the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time.
2. P(A) = 0.5, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2, the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time.
4. P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

However, we also know that:

5. P(A|Attacker) = 0.15, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Since the witness's accuracy might be influenced by the proportion of tall attackers, we should update our prior probability P(A) with this information.

Therefore, let's update P(A) with P(A|Attacker):

P(A) = P(A|Attacker) = 0.15

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.467
