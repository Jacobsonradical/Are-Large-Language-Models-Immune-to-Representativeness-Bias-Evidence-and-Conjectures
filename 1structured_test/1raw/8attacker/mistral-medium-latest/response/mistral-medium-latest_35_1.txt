To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm)
3. P(A) = 0.15 (since P(A) = 1 - P(¬A), and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't have P(B|¬A) directly. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can determine the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short attacker as tall:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 \* (probability of randomly selecting a short person from the sample)

The probability of randomly selecting a short person from the sample is 0.5 since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

So, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.647
