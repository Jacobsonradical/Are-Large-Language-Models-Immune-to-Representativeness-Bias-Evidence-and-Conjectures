To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

First, we know from information (a) that P(A) = 0.5, since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.

From information (b), we know that the witness's accuracy is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller). Likewise, since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are NOT 185 cm or taller).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in our values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889.
