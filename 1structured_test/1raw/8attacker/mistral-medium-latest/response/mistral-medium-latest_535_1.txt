To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some observed evidence (the witness's testimony) can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80% chance the witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% chance the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are not)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = ?

We can calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.5

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8)(0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we need to adjust this probability based on the information that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm. We can use Bayes' theorem again to calculate the updated probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is only 15%. Therefore:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

We can calculate the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm as follows:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) / P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm) = (0.2)(0.85) / 0.85 = 0.2

Therefore:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm) = (0.8)(0.15) / [(0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85)] = 0.333

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.333.
