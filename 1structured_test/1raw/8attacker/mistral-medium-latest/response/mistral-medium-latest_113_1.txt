To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.5 (from information a)
* P(W | H) = 0.8 (from information b)
* P(W | ¬H) = 0.2 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H | W) = P(W | H) \* P(H) / [P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | ¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H | W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(H | W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
