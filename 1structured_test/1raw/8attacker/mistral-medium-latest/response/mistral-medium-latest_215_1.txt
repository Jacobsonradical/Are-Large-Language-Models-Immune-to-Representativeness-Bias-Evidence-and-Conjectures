To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, let event A be "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B be "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Where:
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller,
P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm,
P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller,
P(B|¬A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and
P(A|B) is the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information provided:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).
2. P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
3. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time).
4. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases and 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
