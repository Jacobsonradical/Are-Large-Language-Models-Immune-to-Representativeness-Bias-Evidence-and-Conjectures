To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here are the steps:

1. First, we need to define some probabilities:
* Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H). Based on information (a), we know that the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those who are shorter than 185 cm, so we can assume that P(H) = 0.5.
* Let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height as P(C|H) if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(C|~H) if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Based on information (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, so we have P(C|H) = 0.8 and P(C|~H) = 0.2.
* Let's denote the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as P(C). Based on information (b), we know that a witness made this identification, so we have P(C) = 1.
2. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|C) = [P(C|H) \* P(H)] / P(C)

3. We know that P(C|H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.5, and P(C) = 1, so we can plug these values into the formula:

P(H|C) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / 1 = 0.4

4. However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we can adjust our prior probability P(H) based on this information. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are an attacker as P'(H). Then, we have:

P'(H) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15

5. Now we can use Bayes' theorem again to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, using our updated prior probability P'(H):

P'(H|C) = [P(C|H) \* P'(H)] / P(C)

6. We know that P(C|H) = 0.8, P'(H) = 0.15, and P(C) = 1, so we can plug these values into the formula:

P'(H|C) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 1 = 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
