To find the estimated probability, we will use Bayes' theorem:

P(H | E) = P(E | H) \* P(H) / [P(E | H) \* P(H) + P(E | not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
E: The witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.5 (equal population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
P(E | H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(E | not H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(not H) = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(H | E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H | E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H | E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H | E) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8.
