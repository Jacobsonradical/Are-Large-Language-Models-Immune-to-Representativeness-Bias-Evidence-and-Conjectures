To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). From information a, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, the attacker's distribution is different, with 85% of attackers being under 185 cm and 15% being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information b, we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From information b, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller in 10% of the cases involving attackers shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.1.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.647

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.647.
