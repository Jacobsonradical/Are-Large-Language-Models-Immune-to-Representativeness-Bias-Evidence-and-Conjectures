To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define some events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We also know that:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (since the attacker is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall 20% \* 85% = 0.17 of the time, which is close to 0.2)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
