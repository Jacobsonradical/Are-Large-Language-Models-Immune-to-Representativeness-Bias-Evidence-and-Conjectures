To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the problem statement, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.)
P(H) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.)

However, we need to adjust P(H) based on the information about the attackers. Since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(H) = 0.15

Now we need to find P(W). We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Where H' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that:

P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time:

P(W|H') = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
P(W) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(H|W) ≈ 0.5217

{probability: 0.5217}
