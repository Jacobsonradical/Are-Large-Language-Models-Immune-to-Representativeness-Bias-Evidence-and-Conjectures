To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population sizes)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
