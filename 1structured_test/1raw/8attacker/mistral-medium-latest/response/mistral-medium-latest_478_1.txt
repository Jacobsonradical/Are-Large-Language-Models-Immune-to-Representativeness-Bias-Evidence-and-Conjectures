To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method for calculating conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the given information:

1. a: P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size) and P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
2. a: P(A|H) = 0.15 (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller) and P(A|¬H) = 0.85

Since the witness's testimony doesn't affect the distribution of attackers' heights, we can use the general population proportions P(H) and P(¬H) instead of P(A|H) and P(A|¬H).

1. b: P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
2. b: P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 1
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
