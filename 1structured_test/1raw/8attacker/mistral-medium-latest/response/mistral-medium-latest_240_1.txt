To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:

a) P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).

b) P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).

Now we need to find P(B), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We can find this probability using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the given information:

c) P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size).

d) P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm according to the information in "a").

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is 0.8.
