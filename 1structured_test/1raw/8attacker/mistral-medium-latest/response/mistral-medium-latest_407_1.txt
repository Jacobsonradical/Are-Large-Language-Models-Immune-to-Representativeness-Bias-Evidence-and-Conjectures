To solve this question, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, let's find the prior probability P(H) and P(~H). As the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate:

P(H) = 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075
P(~H) = 0.85 * 0.5 = 0.425

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given the attacker's height, P(W|H) and P(W|~H). The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when a person is 185 cm or taller, and errs in 20% of the cases when a person is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W|H) = 0.8
P(W|~H) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we found:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.1538461538

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 15.38%.
