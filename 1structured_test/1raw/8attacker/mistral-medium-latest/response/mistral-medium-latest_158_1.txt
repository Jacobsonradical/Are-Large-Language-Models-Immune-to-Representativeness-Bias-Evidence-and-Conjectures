To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

First, let's define some variables:

P(H) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(S) = Probability that the witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|S), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness says it is.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|S) = P(S|H) \* P(H) / P(S)

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

P(S|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(S) = P(S|H) \* P(H) + P(S|~H) \* P(~H)

P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(S|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Plugging in the values:

P(S) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|S):

P(H|S) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
