To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Here, event A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B represents the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the given information, we can identify the following probabilities:

P(A) = Probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(¬A) = Probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)
P(B|¬A) = Probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information a)

First, we need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
