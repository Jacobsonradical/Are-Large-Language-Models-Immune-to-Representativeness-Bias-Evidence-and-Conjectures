To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where ¬A represents the complement of A (i.e., the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm), and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A).

From the given information, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
* P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time.
* P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to the population of people who are shorter than 185 cm.
* P(¬A) = 0.5, since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A).

However, we do not have enough information to determine P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Fortunately, we can use the information in statement (b) to estimate P(B|¬A). Specifically, we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and that the witness errs in 20% of cases when judging the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, we can estimate P(B|¬A) as follows:

P(B|¬A) = (percentage of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm) \* (probability of witness error when judging the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.85 \* 0.2
= 0.17

Now we can plug in these probabilities into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.17 \* 0.5)]
= 0.4706 / [0.4706 + 0.085]
= 0.4706 / 0.5556
≈ 0.847

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.847.
