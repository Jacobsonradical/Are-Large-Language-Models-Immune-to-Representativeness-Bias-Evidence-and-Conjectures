{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
2. Next, we need to find the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the population distribution. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, this probability is 0.5.
3. However, the attacker distribution is different, with only 15% being 185 cm or taller (as per information a). So, we adjust our probability to 0.15.
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony: P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says so) = [P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)] / P(Witness says so)
5. We know that P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy). We also determined that P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15.
6. To find P(Witness says so), we can use the law of total probability: P(Witness says so) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm) + P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm). Since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(Witness says so | Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.2 and P(Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.85.
7. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: P(Witness says so) = (0.2 \* 0.85) + (0.8 \* 0.15) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29.
8. Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony: P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56.
