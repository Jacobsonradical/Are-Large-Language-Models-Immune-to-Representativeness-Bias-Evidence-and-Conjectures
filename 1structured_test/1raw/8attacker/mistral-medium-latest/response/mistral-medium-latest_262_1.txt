To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some events:

A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From information (a), we know that:
P(A) = 0.5 (attackers are equally distributed between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

From information (a) and (b), we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

{probability: 0.8889}
