To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Let's use the following notation:
P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller
P(¬A) = probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
2. P(B|A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2, since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was not 185 cm or taller.
4. P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(A|B), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

However, we should consider the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information should change our prior probability P(A). Let's update the prior probability with this new information:

1. P(A) = 0.15, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
2. P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can recalculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.413

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.413. Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.413}
