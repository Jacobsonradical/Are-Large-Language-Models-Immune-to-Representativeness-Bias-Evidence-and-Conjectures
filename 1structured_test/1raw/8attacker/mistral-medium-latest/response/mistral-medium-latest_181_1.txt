To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm and identifies them as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculate the result:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
