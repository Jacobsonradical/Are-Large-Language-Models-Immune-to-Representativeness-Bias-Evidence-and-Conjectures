To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, we know from information (a) that P(H) = 0.5 (equal distribution of heights in the population). Similarly, P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness's testimony given the attacker's height. From information (b), we have:

- P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall person 80% of the time)
- P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short person as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

In the requested format: {probability: 0.8}
