To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some probabilities:

P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution of attackers (from information a). This is 0.15.

P(B): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population distribution of attackers. This is 0.85.

P(W|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (from information b). This is 0.80.

P(W|B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.20.

Now, we want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|B) \* P(B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.395.
