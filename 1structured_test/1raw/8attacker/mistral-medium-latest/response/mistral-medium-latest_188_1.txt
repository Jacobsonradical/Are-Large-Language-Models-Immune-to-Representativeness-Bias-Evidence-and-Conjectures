To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
E: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We'll use the provided information to calculate the probabilities:

1. P(H): According to point a, 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Since the attack has occurred, we'll use the attacker distribution: 0.15.
2. P(not H): The remaining attackers are shorter than 185 cm: 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.
3. P(E|H): The witness correctly identifies a person with a height of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: 0.80.
4. P(E|not H): The witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: 0.20.

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.397

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony is approximately 0.397.
