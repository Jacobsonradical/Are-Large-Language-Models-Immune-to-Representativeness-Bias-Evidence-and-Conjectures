To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and the witness is more likely to mistakenly identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller than a taller person as being shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888... ≈ 0.89

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.89.
