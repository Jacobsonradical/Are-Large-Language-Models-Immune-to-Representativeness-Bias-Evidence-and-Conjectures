To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where:

A = the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those who are shorter)

We also know that:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (the population of people who are shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size to those who are 185 cm or taller)

We can find P(B) by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

However, we also have additional information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller versus those who are shorter. We can use this information to update our prior probability for P(A).

Let's denote the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller as P(Attacker A). From the given information, we know that:

P(Attacker A) = 0.15

Therefore, we can update our prior probability for P(A) as follows:

P(A) = P(A | Not Attacker) \* P(Not Attacker) + P(A | Attacker) \* P(Attacker A)
P(A) = 0.5 \* (1 - 0.15) + 1 \* 0.15
P(A) = 0.575

We can now recalculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem with our updated prior probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.575 / 0.5
P(A|B) ≈ 0.92

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.92.
