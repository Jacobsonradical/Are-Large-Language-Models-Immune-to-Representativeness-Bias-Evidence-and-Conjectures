{probability: 0.27, explanation: "First, we find the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80% of the time). Next, we find the probability that an attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that they were identified as such by the witness. Using Bayes' theorem, we find this probability to be P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B). Here, P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size). P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. P(B) is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people who are not 185 cm or taller). Therefore, P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / 0.5 = 0.8. However, we are given additional information that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we need to adjust our prior probability P(A) from 0.5 to 0.15. Using Bayes' theorem again, we find P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / P(B) = 0.27 (approximately)."}
