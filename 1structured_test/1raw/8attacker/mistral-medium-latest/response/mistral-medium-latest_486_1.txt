To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here, our prior beliefs are based on the information in (a) and the new evidence is the witness's testimony in (b).

First, let's define some variables:

* P(H) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the information in (a). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and attackers are more likely to be under 185 cm, we can estimate P(H) to be around 0.15.
* P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(H) or 0.85.
* P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to the information in (b), this probability is 0.80.
* P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the information in (b), this probability is 0.20.
* P(E) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate this probability using the law of total probability: P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Substituting the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.
