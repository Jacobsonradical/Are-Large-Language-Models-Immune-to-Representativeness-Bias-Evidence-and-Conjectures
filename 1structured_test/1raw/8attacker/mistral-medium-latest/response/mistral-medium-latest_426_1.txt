To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (from information a)
P(H^c) = 0.5 (complementary probability)
P(W | H) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W | H^c) = 0.2 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find P(H | W):

P(H | W) = P(W | H) * P(H) / [P(W | H) * P(H) + P(W | H^c) * P(H^c)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H | W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(H | W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H | W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H | W) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is:

{probability: 0.8}

Confidence: 90%
