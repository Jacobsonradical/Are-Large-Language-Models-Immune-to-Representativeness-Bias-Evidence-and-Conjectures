To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let's define:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
2. P(A) = 0.5 (The population has an equal number of people shorter and taller than 185 cm)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
4. P(¬A) = 0.5 (The population has an equal number of people shorter and taller than 185 cm)

Note that we also have information about the distribution of attackers' heights (85% shorter, 15% taller). However, we will initially calculate the probability using the general population distribution (equal number of short and tall people) and then adjust our estimate to account for the attacker height distribution.

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we need to adjust our estimate to account for the attacker height distribution:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's recalculate P(B) with the attacker distribution:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's recalculate P(A|B) with the attacker distribution:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the adjusted probability estimate is:
{probability: 0.4138}
