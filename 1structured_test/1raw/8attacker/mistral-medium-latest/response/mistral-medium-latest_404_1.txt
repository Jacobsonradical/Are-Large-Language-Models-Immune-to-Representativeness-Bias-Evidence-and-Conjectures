To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability of H given W, denoted as P(H|W). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the given information, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both the cases where the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height and where they make an error. We can express P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H)

Since P(W and H) = P(W|H) \* P(H) and P(W and not H) = P(W|not H) \* P(not H), we have:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.
