To find the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we know from statement a:
P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.)

From statement b, we can find the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter:
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness errs in 20% of the cases.)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8

So, {probability: 0.8}
