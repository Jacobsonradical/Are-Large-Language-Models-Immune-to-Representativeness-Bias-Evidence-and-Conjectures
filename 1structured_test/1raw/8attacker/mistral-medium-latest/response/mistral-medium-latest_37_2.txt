To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the given information:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

First, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
