To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We are given P(A) = 0.5, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

We are also given P(B|A) = 0.8, as the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller.

However, we are not directly given P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can infer that the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
