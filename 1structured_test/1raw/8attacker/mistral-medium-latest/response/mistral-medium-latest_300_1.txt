To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we need to find P(A) and P(B|A). From information a, we know that 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. Since the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.429

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.429}
