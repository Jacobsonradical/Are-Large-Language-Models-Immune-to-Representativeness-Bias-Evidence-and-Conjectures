To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define some events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time), and from the problem description, we know P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that P(¬A) = 0.5, and since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, {probability: 0.8}
