{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
2. Next, we need to account for the bias in the population of attackers, where only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.
4. Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
5. In this case, event A is "Attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "Witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
6. Plugging in the given values: P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
7. Since the witness's error rate is 20%, P(B|¬A) = 0.2. And P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
8. Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.29.
9. Finally, P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.56.
10. The estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, is approximately 0.56.
