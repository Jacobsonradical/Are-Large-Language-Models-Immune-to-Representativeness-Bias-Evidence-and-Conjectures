To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the provided information:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(H|¬W) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 \* 0.2) = 0.15 / 0.21 = 0.7143 (since 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H|W) = 1 - P(H|W)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

However, we need to consider that the witness might have been influenced by the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, as stated in information "a". If that's the case, the witness might have been less likely to identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they aren't sure, which would mean that P(W|¬H) should be lower than 0.2. If we assume that P(W|¬H) is actually 0.1 (meaning the witness only errs 10% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller), then we can recalculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.1 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.05) = 0.8 / 0.85 ≈ 0.9412

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is between 0.8889 and 0.9412, depending on how much the witness was influenced by the knowledge of the attacker's statistics.

{probability: 0.915, this is the average of the two calculated probabilities}
