To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).
- P(B) as the probability of a witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 since the witness makes correct identifications 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller and 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm (from information a).
- P(B|A) as the probability of a witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information a).
- P(A|B) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B), we need to calculate the total probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

From information a, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies people shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time). Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.31

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.3871
