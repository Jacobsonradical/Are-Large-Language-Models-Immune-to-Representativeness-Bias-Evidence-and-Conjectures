To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and ~H and ~E are their respective complements.

From the information provided, we have:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (15% of the population is tall and half of them are attackers)
P(~H) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (85% of the population is short and half of them are attackers)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.157 / (0.157 + 0.085)
P(H|E) ≈ 0.157 / 0.242
P(H|E) ≈ 0.649

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.649.
