{probability: 0.47, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct when they say that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability is 0.8.
2. However, we also need to take into account the fact that the witness is more likely to identify someone as 185 cm or taller even when they are not. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, the witness will erroneously identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time for the 50% of the population that is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of the witness making an error in this case is 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1.
3. Now we need to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said they are. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness said so)

1. We know that the probability of the witness saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is equal to the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness being correct, plus the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the witness making an error:

P(Witness said so) = P(Witness is correct and attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness is incorrect and attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.085
= 0.205

1. Therefore, using the values we have calculated, we can find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.205
= 0.12 / 0.205
= 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.47.
