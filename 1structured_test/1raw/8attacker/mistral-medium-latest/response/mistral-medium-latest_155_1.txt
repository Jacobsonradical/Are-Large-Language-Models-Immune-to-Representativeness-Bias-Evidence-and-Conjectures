First, let's estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first information point (a). Since 85% of the attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, the probability is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Information a) = 0.15

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony, as per information point (b). We know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases. However, since the witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct given their testimony:

P(Witness is correct | Witness testimony) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness is correct) / P(Witness testimony)

We can rewrite this using Bayes' theorem:

P(Witness is correct | Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness testimony)

From information point (b), we know that:

P(Witness testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies the attacker's height)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from our calculation above)

Furthermore, since the witness can either be correct or incorrect when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm)

From information point (b), we know that the witness errs 20% of the time:
P(Witness testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height)
Since 85% of the attackers are under 185 cm (information point a):
P(Attacker is not 185 cm) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(Witness testimony):

P(Witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the witness is correct given their testimony:

P(Witness is correct | Witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, taking both pieces of information into account, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
