To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this probability is 0.8 (80%).

Next, let's find P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that P(A) = 0.5.

Now, let's find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A denotes the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (20%), and since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we need to adjust this probability in light of the information about the prevalence of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15%) and shorter than 185 cm (85%). We can calculate the revised probability using the updated prior probabilities:

P'(A) = 0.15
P'(¬A) = 0.85

Now, let's recalculate P'(B) and P'(A|B) using these updated probabilities:

P'(B) = P(B|A) \* P'(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P'(¬A)
        = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
        = 0.21

P'(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.21 ≈ 0.619

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the information about the prevalence of attackers, is approximately 0.619.
