To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we know:

1. P(H) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than 185 cm).
2. P(W|H) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time).

We still need to find P(W), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We know P(H) = 0.5 and P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

We also need P(W|¬H), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.667

{probability: 0.667}
