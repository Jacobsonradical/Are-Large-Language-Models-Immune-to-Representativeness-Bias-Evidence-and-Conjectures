To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B represents the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. The probabilities required for Bayes' theorem can be extracted from the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a person's height)

Now, we need to calculate P(B). According to the law of total probability, P(B) can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
