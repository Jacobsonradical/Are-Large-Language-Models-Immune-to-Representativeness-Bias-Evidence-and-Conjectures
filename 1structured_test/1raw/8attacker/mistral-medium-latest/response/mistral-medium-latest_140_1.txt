To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b). Here's how we can calculate it:

1. First, let's consider the witness's accuracy in identifying heights. The witness correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when they are actually shorter.
2. Now, let's consider the population distribution of attackers. We know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = [P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)] / P(Witness says 185+ cm)

1. We have the following probabilities:
   - P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8 (witness is correct when the attacker is 185+ cm)
   - P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15 (population distribution of attackers)
   - P(Witness says 185+ cm) = P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm)
     - P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.2 (witness errs when the attacker is <185 cm)
     - P(Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.85 (population distribution of attackers)

1. Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

1. Calculating the final probability, we get:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) â‰ˆ 0.375

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
