To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases, given a sample of people half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:
Numerator = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4
Denominator = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now divide the numerator by the denominator:
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
