To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we know the prior probability P(A) from statement a:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given the attacker's height. From statement b, we know:
P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

To find the denominator P(W), we need to consider the total probability of the witness's testimony:

P(W) = P(W and A) + P(W and ¬A)
      = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.667

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.667.
