To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.
P(B) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm in the general population.
P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(A|W) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller. This is what we want to find.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
P(W|B) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

However, we need to adjust P(A) and P(B) based on the information about the distribution of attackers. Let's denote:

P'(A) as the adjusted probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P'(B) as the adjusted probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We have:

P'(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P'(B) = 1 - P'(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P'(A)] / [P(W|A) \* P'(A) + P(W|B) \* P'(B)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|W) â‰ˆ 0.281 or 28.1%

{probability: 0.281}
