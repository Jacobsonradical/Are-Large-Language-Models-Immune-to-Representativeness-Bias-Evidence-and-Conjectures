To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
