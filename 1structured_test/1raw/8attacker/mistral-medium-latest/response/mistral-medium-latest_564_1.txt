To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we also need to consider that the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is only 15%, so we should adjust our prior probability:

P(H) = 0.15

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Where H' denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We have:

P(W|H') = 0.2 (The witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(H') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.255

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.467.
