To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define the following events:

A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A|W) = 0.85/1.85 ≈ 0.459 (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, but we need to adjust this probability based on the witness's identification)

Now we can find P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|W) ≈ 0.889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889.
