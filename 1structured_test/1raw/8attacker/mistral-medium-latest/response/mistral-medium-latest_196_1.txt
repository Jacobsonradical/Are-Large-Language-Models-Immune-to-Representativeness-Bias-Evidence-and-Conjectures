To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(Tall) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to statement b.
P(Short) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
P(Correct | Tall) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to statement a.
P(Incorrect | Short) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to statement a.
P(Identified Tall) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is given as the evidence.

We want to find P(Tall | Identified Tall), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Identified Tall) = P(Identified Tall | Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(Identified Tall | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Identified Tall | Short) \* P(Short)]

We already have P(Tall) = 0.15 and P(Short) = 0.85. We need to find P(Identified Tall | Tall) and P(Identified Tall | Short).

P(Identified Tall | Tall) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(Identified Tall | Short) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(Tall | Identified Tall):

P(Tall | Identified Tall) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(Tall | Identified Tall) â‰ˆ 0.385 or 38.5%

{probability: 0.385}
