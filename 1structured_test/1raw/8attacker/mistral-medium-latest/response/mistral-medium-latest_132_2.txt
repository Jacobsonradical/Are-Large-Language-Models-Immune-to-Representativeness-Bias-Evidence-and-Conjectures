To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.5 (due to the equal size of populations)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness identification accuracy for people 185 cm or taller)

Now we need P(W). Using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We know P(H) = 0.5 and P(W|H) = 0.8. Also, P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5. Now we need to find P(W|not H). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 0.2. Thus, P(W|not H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, this answer seems too high. It appears that there might be an issue with the question, as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony should not exceed the prior probability (0.5) in this case. Let's reconsider the problem.

Upon closer inspection, there is an inconsistency in the information provided. According to point a:

"85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller."

This contradicts the assumption that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. A more accurate prior probability for P(H) would be 0.15 based on the information about the attackers.

Using the corrected prior probability:

P(H) = 0.15

Now we can recalculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the correct P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.41.
