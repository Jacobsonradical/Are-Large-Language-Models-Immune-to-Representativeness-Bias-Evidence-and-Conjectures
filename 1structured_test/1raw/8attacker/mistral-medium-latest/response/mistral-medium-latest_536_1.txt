To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as P(E). We want to find the posterior probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where P(E|H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given in part (a), we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, we can assume that the prior probability P(H) is 0.5.

From the information given in part (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, we can assume that the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.2.

We also need to find the probability P(E), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

where P(E|not H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, and P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

We already know that P(E|H) is 0.8, P(H) is 0.5, and P(E|not H) is 0.2. Therefore, we can calculate P(not H) as follows:

P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
