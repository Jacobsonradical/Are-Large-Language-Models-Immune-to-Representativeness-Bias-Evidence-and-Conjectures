To find an estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)

In this case:

Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
Event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

Given:

P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy for people 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errors for people shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

We want to find P(A|B). First, we need to find P(B).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A)
    = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
    = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)
    = 0.4 + 0.1
    = 0.5

Now, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, we should also consider the information given in (b) about the distribution of attackers. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is only 15%, so we should update our estimate:

P'(A) = 0.15
P'(¬A) = 1 - P'(A) = 0.85

With this new prior probability:

P'(B) = P(B|A) \* P'(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P'(¬A)
    = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
    = 0.12 + 0.17
    = 0.29

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P'(A)) / P'(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138
