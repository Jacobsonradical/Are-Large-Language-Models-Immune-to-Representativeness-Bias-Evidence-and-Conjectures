To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(B|¬A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to information b.
P(B) as the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B). We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8 or 80%.
