To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Where:

* H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* P(H) and P(¬H) are the prior probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively
* P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) are the likelihoods of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

However, we also need to take into account the fact that attackers who are shorter than 185 cm are more likely to commit such crimes. From the information provided, we can determine that:

* P(A|H) = 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller)
* P(A|¬H) = 0.85

Where A is the event that the attacker committed the crime.

However, we don't have information about the prior probability of a person committing such a crime, so we cannot directly use P(A|H) and P(A|¬H) in our calculation. Instead, we can use the fact that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller to update our prior probabilities of the attacker's height.

Let's call P'(H) the updated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. We can use Bayes' theorem again to calculate P'(H):

P'(H) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
= (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
= 0.8 / 0.9
≈ 0.889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.889.
