To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
P(W|not H) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
