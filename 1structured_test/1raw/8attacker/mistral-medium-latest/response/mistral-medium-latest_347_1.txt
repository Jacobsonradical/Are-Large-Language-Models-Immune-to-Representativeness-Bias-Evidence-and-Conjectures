{probability: 0.27, explanation: "The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated by using Bayes' theorem. First, we know that the prior probability (P(A)) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller). Next, we know that the witness has a true positive rate (P(B|A)) of 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller). The false positive rate (P(B|¬A)) is 0.1 (10% chance of incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, since the witness errs in 20% of cases and half of those errors will be identifying someone as taller than 185 cm when they are not). Using Bayes' theorem (P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]), we find that P(A|B) ≈ 0.27."}
