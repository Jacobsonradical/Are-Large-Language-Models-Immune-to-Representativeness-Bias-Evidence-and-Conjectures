To find the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find P(W|A), the probability that the witness identifies an actual tall person as tall. According to the information provided, P(W|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is actually tall given that the witness identified them as tall. We can find this using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / P(W)

We know that P(W|A) = 0.8, and from the information provided, P(A) = 0.5 (equal population sizes). However, we don't yet know P(W), the probability that the witness identifies someone as tall regardless of their actual height. To find this, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness identifies a short person as tall and the possibility that they identify a tall person as tall.

The probability that the witness identifies a short person as tall is P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (from the witness's error rate). We also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so P(¬A) = 0.85. Therefore:

P(¬A ∩ W) = P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

Since there are only two possibilities (attacker is tall or short), we can find P(A ∩ W) by subtracting P(¬A ∩ W) from 1:

P(A ∩ W) = 1 - P(¬A ∩ W) = 1 - 0.17 = 0.83

However, we're interested in P(W), the total probability that the witness identifies someone as tall, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness identifying a tall person as tall and a short person as tall:

P(W) = P(A ∩ W) + P(¬A ∩ W) = 0.83 + 0.17 = 0.97

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.97 ≈ 0.4124
