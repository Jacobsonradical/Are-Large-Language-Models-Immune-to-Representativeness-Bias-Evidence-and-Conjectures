To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

However, we also need to consider the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we should adjust our prior probabilities P(A) and P(¬A) as follows:

P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.17) ≈ 0.18 / 0.35 ≈ 0.5143

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5143.
