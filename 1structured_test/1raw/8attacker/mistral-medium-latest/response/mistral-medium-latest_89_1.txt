To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

First, we know that P(H) = 0.5 from statement a.

We also know that:

- P(W|H) = 0.8, the witness correctly identifies a tall person (from statement b)
- P(W|not H) = 0.2, the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (from statement b)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = [(0.8) \* (0.5)] / [(0.8) \* (0.5) + (0.2) \* (0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
