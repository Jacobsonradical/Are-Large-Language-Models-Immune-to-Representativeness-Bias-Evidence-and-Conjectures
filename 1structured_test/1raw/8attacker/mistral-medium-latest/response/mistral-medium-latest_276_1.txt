To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Where:
P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
P(E|H) is the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.
P(E) is the probability of the witness's testimony.

From the information given, we can determine the following probabilities:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H)

We can calculate P(E and H) as follows:
P(E and H) = P(E|H) \* P(H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4

From the information given, we can also determine that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of a witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20% error rate \* 85% of attackers being shorter than 185 cm).

Therefore, we can calculate P(E and not H) as follows:
P(E and not H) = P(E|not H) \* P(not H) = 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:
P(E) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
