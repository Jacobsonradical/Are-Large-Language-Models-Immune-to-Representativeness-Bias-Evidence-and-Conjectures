To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use the following form of Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We also need to find P(W|H'), where H' denotes the complementary event of H (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We know that:

P(W|H') = 0.2 (since the witness errs in judging a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we need to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8
