To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in the field of statistics and probability. It is used to calculate the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event occurring. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the probability of event A given event B as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Let's break down each term in this equation:

* P(A): The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. From the information provided in part a, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, P(A) = 0.5.
* P(not A): The probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm. Since P(A) = 0.5, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5.
* P(B|A): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. From the information provided in part b, we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.
* P(B|not A): The probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm. From the information provided in part b, we know that the witness erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) = 0.88888888889

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.89 or 89%.
