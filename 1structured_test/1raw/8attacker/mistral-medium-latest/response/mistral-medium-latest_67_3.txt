To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on the information given in part a.

P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 according to the information provided in part b.

P(E|¬H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). This probability is 0.2, as per the information in part b.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
