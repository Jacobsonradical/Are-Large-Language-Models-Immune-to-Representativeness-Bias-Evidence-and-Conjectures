To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without the witness information)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.
