To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From Bayes' theorem: P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From information (a), we know that P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
From information (b), we know that P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time).

We also need P(W|not H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. From information (b), we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W|not H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
