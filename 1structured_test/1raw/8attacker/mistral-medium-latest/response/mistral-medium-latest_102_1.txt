To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on prior knowledge and new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote H as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to calculate P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
3. P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)
4. P(¬H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we are not given P(W) directly. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Now we have:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8
