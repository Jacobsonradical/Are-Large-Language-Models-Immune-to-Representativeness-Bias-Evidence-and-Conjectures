To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We know P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time) and P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

So P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we must also consider the information given in point (a) about the distribution of attackers' heights. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, we should update our prior probability P(A) from 0.5 to 0.15.

Using this new prior probability, we can recalculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.24}.
