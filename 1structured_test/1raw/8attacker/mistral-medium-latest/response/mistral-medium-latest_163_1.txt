To find an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and update our beliefs using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event "Attacker is 185 cm or taller" as A.

Given the data:
1. Prior probability of A (P(A)): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate P(A) as 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075.
2. False positive rate (erroneously identifying someone shorter as 185 cm or taller): The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the false positive rate is 0.2.
3. True positive rate (correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller): The witness is correct 80% of the time, so the true positive rate is 0.8.

Now let's apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|Witness) = P(Witness|A) \* P(A) / [P(Witness|A) \* P(A) + P(Witness|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We need to find P(Witness|A) and P(Witness|¬A). Since the witness has an 80% true positive rate, P(Witness|A) = 0.8. For the false positive rate, we use the 20% error rate when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(Witness|¬A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.925)] ≈ 0.277

{probability: 0.277}
