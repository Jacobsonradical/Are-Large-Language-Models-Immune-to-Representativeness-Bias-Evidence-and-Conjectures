To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(F) as the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller
- P(W|F) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(W|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(T) = P(F) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We are also given information about the distribution of attackers:

- P(A|T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|F) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need P(T|A) and P(F|A) to apply Bayes' theorem. We can calculate these probabilities using the formula:

P(T|A) = P(A|T) \* P(T) / [P(A|T) \* P(T) + P(A|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|A) = (0.15 \* 0.5) / [(0.15 \* 0.5) + (0.85 \* 0.5)]
P(T|A) â‰ˆ 0.1613

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1613.
