To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on the information in point a.

P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the information in point b.

P(E|~H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on the information in point b.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = [(0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8.
