To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B).

From the given information:

1. P(B|A) = The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. This is 80%.
2. P(A) = The prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(A) is approximately 0.5.
3. P(B) = The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases:

a) The attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A), and the witness correctly identifies them as such (event B). The probability of this is P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4.

b) The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (event not A), but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (event B). Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 20%, or 0.2. So, the probability of this case is P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can find P(B) by adding the probabilities of these two cases: P(B) = 0.4 + 0.17 = 0.57.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.57 â‰ˆ 0.6982

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.6982.
