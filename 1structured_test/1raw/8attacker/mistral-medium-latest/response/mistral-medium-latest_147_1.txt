To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find the prior probability P(H). According to information "a", the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So we can assume that:

P(H) = 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075

Now let's find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|H). From information "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore:

P(W|H) = 0.8

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(W|¬H). From information "b", we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases. So:

P(W|¬H) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in our values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.925)]

Calculate the result:

probability: 0.25, or 25% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.25}
