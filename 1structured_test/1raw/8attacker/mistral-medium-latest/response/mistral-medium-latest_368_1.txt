To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Where:
H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W is the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
¬H is the negation of H
¬W is the negation of W

From the information given, we can assign the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases involving people shorter than 185 cm, and we assume that the witness is equally likely to err in either direction)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.889

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information is not explicitly included in Bayes' theorem, but we can update our prior probability P(H) based on this information:

P'(H) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) ≈ 0.152
P'(¬H) = 1 - P'(H) ≈ 0.848

Using these updated probabilities, we can recalculate the posterior probability:

P'(H|W) = [0.8 \* 0.152] / [(0.8 \* 0.152) + (0.2 \* 0.848)] ≈ 0.122 / 0.194 ≈ 0.629

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the information about the prevalence of attackers' heights is approximately 0.629.
