To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information (b).
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 according to information (a).
- P(B|¬A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is 0.2 according to information (a).
- P(B) as the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, we need to find P(B). Since P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ ¬A), we can calculate it as follows:
P(B ∩ A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12
P(B ∩ ¬A) = P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17
P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ ¬A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
