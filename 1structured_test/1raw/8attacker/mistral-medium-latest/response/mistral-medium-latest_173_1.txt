To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:
H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are given:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(~H) = 0.5 (the complement of P(H))
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we are also given that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information suggests that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) should be updated to 0.15.

Using this updated prior probability, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the prior information about the population of attackers is approximately 0.4138.
