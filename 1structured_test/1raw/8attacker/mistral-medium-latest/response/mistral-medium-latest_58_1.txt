To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W|¬H) (the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that their height is actually shorter than 185 cm). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Given that P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5, we have:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

{probability: 0.6667}
