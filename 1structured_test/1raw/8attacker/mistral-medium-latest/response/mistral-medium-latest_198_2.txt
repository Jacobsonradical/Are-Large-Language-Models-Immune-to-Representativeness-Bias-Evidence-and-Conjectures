To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). Based on the information provided in a, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Based on the information provided in b, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Based on the information provided in b, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4286

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4286.
