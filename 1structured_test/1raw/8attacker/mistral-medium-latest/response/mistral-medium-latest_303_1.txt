To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Where:
H = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (from information a)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (from information b, since the witness errs 20% of the time)
P(¬H) = 0.5 (from information a)

We need to find P(E), which is the probability of the witness's testimony regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) \* P(H)) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
