{probability: 0.56, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:

First, we need to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony. Bayes' theorem can be used here:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the witness testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter and taller than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / (0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.56

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony is 0.56.
