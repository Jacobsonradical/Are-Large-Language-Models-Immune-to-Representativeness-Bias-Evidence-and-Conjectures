To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E: The event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

To find P(E), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when they are shorter:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that:

P(¬H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we don't know P(E|¬H) directly. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and they make errors when identifying people shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, we can conclude that:

P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8
