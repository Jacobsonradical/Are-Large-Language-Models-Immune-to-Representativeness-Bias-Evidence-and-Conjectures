To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness says so)

We have the following information:

P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (from information b, assuming equal population size)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5
P(Witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (from information a, error rate)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and Witness says so) = P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 \* 0.2 = 0.1

P(Witness says so) = P(Witness says so and Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and Witness says so) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and Witness says so) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also have information b, which states that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to adjust our probability estimate based on this information.

Let's assume that the witness's ability to judge height is not affected by whether the person is an attacker or not. In that case, we can use the following reasoning:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is an attacker) / P(Witness says so | Attacker is an attacker)

We already have P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is an attacker) = 0.15.

P(Witness says so | Attacker is an attacker) = P(Witness says so and Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is an attacker) + P(Witness says so and Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is an attacker)

P(Witness says so and Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is an attacker) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is an attacker) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

P(Witness says so and Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is an attacker) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is an attacker) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17

P(Witness says so | Attacker is an attacker) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the adjusted probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
