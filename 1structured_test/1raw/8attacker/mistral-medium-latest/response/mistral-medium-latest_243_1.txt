To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:

1. From information "a", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. So, P(A) = 0.5.
2. The likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, given their actual height:
   a. P(B|A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
   b. P(B|¬A) = 0.2, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.889

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.889.
