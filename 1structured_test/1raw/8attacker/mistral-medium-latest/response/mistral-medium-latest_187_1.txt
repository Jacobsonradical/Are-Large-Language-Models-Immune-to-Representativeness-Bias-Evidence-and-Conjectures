To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we have:

* P(H): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, P(H) = 0.5.
* P(W|H): The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Since the attacker is 185 cm or taller (given H), the witness will correctly identify their height with probability 0.8.
* P(W): This is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this probability using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H'),

where H' denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(H') = 0.5.

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W|H') = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
