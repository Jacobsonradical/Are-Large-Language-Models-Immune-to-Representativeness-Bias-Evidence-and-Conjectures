To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Where:
H = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller

Given the information:
P(E|H) = Witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(¬E|¬H) = Witness's accuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.8
P(H) = Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(¬H) = Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

First, we need to find P(E|¬H), which is the witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm:
P(E|¬H) = 1 - P(¬E|¬H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4211

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4211.
