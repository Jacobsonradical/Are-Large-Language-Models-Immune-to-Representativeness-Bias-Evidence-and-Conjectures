To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

First, let's find the false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) of the witness:

FPR = 20% (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller)
TPR = 80% (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such)

Now, let's denote P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) as P(A) and P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) as P(W). We want to find the posterior probability P(A|W), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|A) = TPR = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as such)
P(W|¬A) = FPR = 0.20 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.387

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:
{probability: 0.387}
