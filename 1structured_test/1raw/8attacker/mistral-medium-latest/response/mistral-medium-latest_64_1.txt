{probability: 0.656}

Here's my reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on information (a). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the prior probability as 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.5) = 0.2.
2. Next, let's estimate the witness's accuracy, based on information (b). The witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Given this information, the likelihood ratio for a witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 / 0.2 = 4.
3. Now, we can update our prior probability using Bayes' theorem. The posterior probability is given by: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness's testimony) = (Likelihood ratio \* Prior probability) / (Likelihood ratio \* Prior probability + 1 - Prior probability) = (4 \* 0.2) / (4 \* 0.2 + 0.8) = 0.656.

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.656.
