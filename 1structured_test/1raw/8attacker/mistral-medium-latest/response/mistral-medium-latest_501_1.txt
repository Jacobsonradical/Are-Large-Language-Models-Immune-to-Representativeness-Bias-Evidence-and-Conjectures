To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided, we have:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (roughly equal population size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

We also know that:

P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

However, we need to adjust P(A) and P(¬A) based on the information about attackers. We know that:

P'(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P'(¬A) = 1 - P'(A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

So, we need to find the likelihood ratio:

L = P(W|A) / P(W|¬A) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Now, using Bayes' theorem with the adjusted probabilities and the likelihood ratio, we can find the updated probability:

P'(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P'(A)] / [{P(W|A) \* P'(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P'(¬A)} \* L]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P'(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) \* 4]

After calculating the above expression:

P'(A|W) ≈ 0.2381

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2381.
