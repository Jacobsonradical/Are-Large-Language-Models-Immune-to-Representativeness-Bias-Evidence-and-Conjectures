To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. Then, we want to find P(A|B).

First, we can find P(A) using the information in a:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Next, we can find P(B|A) using the information in b:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(B|¬A) (the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm):
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of a person shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889 or 88.9%.
