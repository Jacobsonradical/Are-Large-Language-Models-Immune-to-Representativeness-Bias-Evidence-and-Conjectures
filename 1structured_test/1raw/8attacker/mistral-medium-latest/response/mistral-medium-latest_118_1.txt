To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H = "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
E = "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"

Given:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm)
P(not H) = 0.5

However, we also have information about the proportion of attackers that are 185 cm or taller, which should affect our estimate of P(H). Let's call this new probability P'(H).

From the information given, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:
P'(H) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem with this new probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the information about attacker heights, is approximately 0.286.
