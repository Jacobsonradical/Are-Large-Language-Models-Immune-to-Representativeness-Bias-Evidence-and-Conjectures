To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:

* H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H | W), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H | W) = P(W | H) \* P(H) / [P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | not H) \* P(not H)]

From the given information, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size
* P(W | H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller
* P(not H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size

We also know that:

* P(W | not H) = 0.2, since the witness incorrectly identified the height of a person 20% of the time when they are not 185 cm or taller, and we know from the first piece of information that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 = 0.20 \* 0.85 / (0.20 \* 0.85 + 0.80 \* 0.15)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(H | W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.88888888889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.89 or 89%.
