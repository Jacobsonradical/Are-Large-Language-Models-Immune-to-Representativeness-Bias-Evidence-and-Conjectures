To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker, is:

P(A|attacker) = 0.15

Since P(A|attacker) is different from the prior probability P(A), we need to adjust our calculation of P(B) to take this into account. Let C represent the event that the attacker is an attacker. Then:

P(B) = P(B|A and C) \* P(A|C) + P(B|not A and C) \* P(not A|C)

We know that:

P(B|A and C) = P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A|C) = 0.15
P(not A|C) = 1 - P(A|C) = 0.85

However, we do not have enough information to determine P(B|not A and C), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm and is an attacker.

Without this information, we cannot calculate the exact value of P(A|B). However, we can use the information we have to estimate a range of possible values for P(A|B).

One possible approach is to assume that the witness is equally likely to make an error in either direction. That is, if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness is equally likely to identify them as shorter or taller than 185 cm. Under this assumption, P(B|not A and C) = 0.5, and we can calculate:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.66

Using this value of P(B), we can calculate:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.66 â‰ˆ 0.18

However, this is just one possible estimate of P(B|not A and C), and other estimates may be more reasonable depending on the context. For example, if the witness is more likely to underestimate the height of tall people than to overestimate the height of short people, then P(B|not A and C) may be lower than 0.5, and the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller may be higher than 0.18.

In summary, given the available information, we cannot determine the exact probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, but we can estimate a range of possible values based on different assumptions. Under the assumption that the witness is equally likely to make an error in either direction, we estimate that the probability is approximately 0.18. However, this estimate may be revised if more information becomes available.
