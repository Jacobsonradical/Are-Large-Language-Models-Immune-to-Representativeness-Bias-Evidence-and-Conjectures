To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we also need to consider the fact that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information affects the prior probability of A and the likelihood of B.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as C. Then, we have:

P(C) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|C) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|C) \* P(C)
= (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.4 + 0.17
= 0.57

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.57
= 0.4 / 0.57
= 0.698245614

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.70 or 70%.
