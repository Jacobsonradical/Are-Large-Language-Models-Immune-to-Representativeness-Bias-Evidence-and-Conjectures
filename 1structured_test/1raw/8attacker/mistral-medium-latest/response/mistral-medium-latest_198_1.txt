{probability: 0.56, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population of attackers, which is 15% according to information "a". So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
2. Next, let's look at the witness's testimony (information "b"). The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people's heights under similar conditions. So, P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
3. However, the witness also makes mistakes 20% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. So, P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = [P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
5. Plugging in the values from steps 1-3, we get: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.56.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.56.
