{probability: 0.27, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's how I arrived at this estimate:

1. First, we take into account the witness's accuracy in identifying the heights of people 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and the witness has identified the attacker as such, there is an initial probability of 0.8 that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller based on the witness's testimony alone.
2. Next, we consider the fact that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. This gives us a prior probability of 0.5 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we also know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the likelihood of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is lower than the general population. Based on this information, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness testimony).
5. Plugging in the values we have, we get: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.15)].
6. Simplifying this expression, we get: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness testimony) = 0.27.
7. Therefore, based on the available information, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be 0.27.
