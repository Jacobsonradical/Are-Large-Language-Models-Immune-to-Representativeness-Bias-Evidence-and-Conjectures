To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define our events:

* H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

However, we don't have P(W|~H) directly. Instead, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying heights. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is equal, this error rate is distributed equally between the two groups. Therefore:

* P(W|~H) = 0.1 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 10% of the time, as there are half as many tall people in the population)

Now we can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability:

* P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
* P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.1 \* 0.5)
* P(W) = 0.4 + 0.05
* P(W) = 0.45

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

* P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
* P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.45
* P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.8889
