To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a) = 0.5
P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5
P(C|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information b) = 0.8
P(C|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

Now we want to find P(A|C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / [P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|B) \* P(B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|C) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|C) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|C) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|C) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
