To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H>=185). From the information in "a", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

P(H>=185) = 0.15

Now, let's consider the witness testimony in "b". The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We are given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. To find the probability that the witness's testimony is correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H>=185 | Witness) = [P(Witness | H>=185) * P(H>=185)] / P(Witness)

We know:
P(Witness | H>=185) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(H>=185) = 0.15 (from our previous calculation)

However, we don't know P(Witness) directly. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(Witness) = P(Witness | H>=185) * P(H>=185) + P(Witness | H<185) * P(H<185)

Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(Witness | H<185) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time). We also know that P(H<185) = 1 - P(H>=185) = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(Witness):
P(Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H>=185 | Witness):
P(H>=185 | Witness) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
