To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

First, let's find the prior probability P(A). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume P(A) = 0.5.

Next, let's find the probability of the witness's testimony P(B|A). Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8 when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We also need to find the probability of the witness's testimony P(B|¬A), where ¬A denotes that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness erred in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888... ≈ 0.89

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.89.
