To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some terms:

P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on the information in 'a'.

P(B) is the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.

P(E|A) is the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 based on the information in 'b'.

P(E|B) is the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2 based on the information in 'b'.

P(A|E) is the posterior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. This is what we want to find.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E) = P(E|A) \* P(A) / [P(E|A) \* P(A) + P(E|B) \* P(B)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|E) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
