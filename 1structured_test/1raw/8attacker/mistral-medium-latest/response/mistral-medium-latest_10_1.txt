{probability: 0.56}

Explanation: To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case:

1. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to the first piece of information.
2. P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.
3. P(B|A) is the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.
4. P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.56

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.56.
