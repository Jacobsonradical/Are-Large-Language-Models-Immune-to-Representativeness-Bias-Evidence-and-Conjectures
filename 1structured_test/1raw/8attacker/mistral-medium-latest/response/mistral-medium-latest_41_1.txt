To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to the first statement.
P(A|H) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker, which is 0.15 according to the first statement.
P(W|H) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the second statement.
P(W|¬H) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 according to the second statement.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
