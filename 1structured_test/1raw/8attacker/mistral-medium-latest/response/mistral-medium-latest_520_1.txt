To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(W). We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, denoted as P(H|W).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Where ~H denotes the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From the information given, we know that:

P(W|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

P(~H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also know that:

P(W|~H) = P(False positive) = 0.2

However, we need to find P(False negative), which is the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability of a false negative is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

We can use this to find P(W|H), the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, the witness has an equal chance of encountering a person who is 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of encountering a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.5. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 \* 0.8 = 0.4.

Now we have all the information we need to calculate P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.4 \* 0.5) / [(0.4 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(H|W) = 0.8

Therefore, given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
