To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). From the first piece of information, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, it means that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So:

P(A) = 0.15

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A) and P(B|¬A). From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm and half is 185 cm or taller, this means that:

P(B|A) = 0.80
P(B|¬A) = 0.20

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
