To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is the attacker's height (either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller), and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

First, let's define some probabilities:

* P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to the information given in part a.
* P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 according to the information given in part b.
* P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2 according to the information given in part b.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
