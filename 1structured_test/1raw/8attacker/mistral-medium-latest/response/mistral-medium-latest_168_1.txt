To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
P(B|¬A) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (shorter than 185 cm).

From the given information:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
3. P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
4. P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

However, we need to account for the fact that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. We can adjust our prior probability P(A) and P(¬A) as follows:

P(A) = 0.15 (probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in our values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.298 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.298.
