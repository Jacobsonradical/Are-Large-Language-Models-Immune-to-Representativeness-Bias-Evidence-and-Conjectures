To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information a.
P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 according to information b.
P(E|~H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.2 according to information b.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
