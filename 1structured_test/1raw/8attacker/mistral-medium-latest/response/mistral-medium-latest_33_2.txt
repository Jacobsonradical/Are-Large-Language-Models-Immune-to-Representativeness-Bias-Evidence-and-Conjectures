To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller ( Height )
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller ( Witness )

We want to find the probability P(H|W). Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [ P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H) ]

From the given information, we know:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

However, we also have information about the attackers' height distribution, specifically that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, we should update the probabilities of P(H) and P(not H):

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.385

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.385.

{probability: 0.385}
