To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Let's call this event A, and the witness's testimony event B. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we know that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is P(A) = 0.5, since the population is roughly equal in size.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, P(B|A). The witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, P(B|¬A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

However, we also have information about the distribution of attackers' heights (85% under 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller). This might affect our prior probability P(A). But without knowing the relative frequency of attacks by tall people compared to the general population, it's difficult to incorporate this information into our calculation.

Assuming that the distribution of attackers' heights does not differ significantly from the general population, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately:

{probability: 0.8889}
