To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of a hypothesis (the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:
H: the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
E: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis (before considering the evidence)
P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
P(E|¬H): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis (i.e., the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬H): the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis

We are given:
P(H) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
P(¬H) = P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the expression:
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1] = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8. However, we have an additional piece of information that 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information should update our prior probability P(H) and P(¬H).

Given this new information, let's update our prior probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15
P(¬H) = 0.85

Now, recalculate P(H|E) using the updated values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, considering all the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
