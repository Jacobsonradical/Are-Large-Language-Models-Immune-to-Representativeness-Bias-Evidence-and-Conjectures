To find the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
2. P(¬H) = 0.5 (complementary probability)
3. P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
4. P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
5. P(H|Attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
6. P(¬H|Attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

However, we should note that the probabilities P(H|Attacker) and P(¬H|Attacker) do not correspond to the actual probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Instead, they provide information about the prevalence of attackers in different height categories. To adjust for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability we are looking for, P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Now, we can plug in the given probabilities:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the expression:

P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(H|W) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
