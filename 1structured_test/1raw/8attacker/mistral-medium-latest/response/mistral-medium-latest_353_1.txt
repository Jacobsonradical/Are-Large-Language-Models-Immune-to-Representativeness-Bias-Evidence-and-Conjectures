To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying a person's height 20% of the time, and ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
