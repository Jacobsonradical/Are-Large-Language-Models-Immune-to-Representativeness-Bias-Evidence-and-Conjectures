To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From information (a), we know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

From information (b), we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
       = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')
       = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
         = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
         = 0.3846

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.3846.
