To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) * P(H) / [P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|H') * P(H')]

where H' represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we know:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(H') = 0.5

P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|H') = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
