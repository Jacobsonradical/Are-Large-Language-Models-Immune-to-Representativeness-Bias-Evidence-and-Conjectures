To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that:

P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(~A) = 0.5 (the complement of P(A))

We also know that:

P(W|~A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using the law of total probability, we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A)
P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8)(0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the information in statement b, which provides the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population of attackers. We can adjust our prior probability P(A) using this information:

P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now we can recalculate P(W) and P(A|W):

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|~A) \* P(~A)
P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) ≈ 0.265

P(A|W) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.265 ≈ 0.453

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.453.
