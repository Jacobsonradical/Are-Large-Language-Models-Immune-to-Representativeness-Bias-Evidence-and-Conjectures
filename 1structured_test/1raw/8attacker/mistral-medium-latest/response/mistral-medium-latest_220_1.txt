To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
P(E|H): The likelihood of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
P(E|¬H): The likelihood of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

However, we also know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability P(H) should be adjusted to take into account the attacker population. So, P(H) = 0.15 and P(¬H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:
P(H|E) ≈ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the attacker population, is approximately 0.395.

{probability: 0.395}
