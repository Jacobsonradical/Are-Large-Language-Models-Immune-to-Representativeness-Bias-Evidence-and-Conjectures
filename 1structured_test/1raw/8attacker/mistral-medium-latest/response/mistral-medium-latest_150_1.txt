To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence is the witness's testimony (E).

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height as P(E|H) and incorrectly identifying the height as P(E|¬H), where ¬H means not H.

From the information given, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
* P(¬H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
* P(E|¬H) = 0.2, since the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm.

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information changes the prior probabilities of H and ¬H.

Let's denote the probability of being an attacker and being 185 cm or taller as P(A ∩ H), and the probability of being an attacker and being shorter than 185 cm as P(A ∩ ¬H). Since the probability of being an attacker is the same for all people, we have:

* P(A ∩ H) = 0.15 \* P(H) = 0.15 \* 0.5 = 0.075
* P(A ∩ ¬H) = 0.85 \* P(¬H) = 0.85 \* 0.5 = 0.425

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]

P(H|E) ≈ 0.176 / (0.176 + 0.085)

P(H|E) ≈ 0.176 / 0.261

P(H|E) ≈ 0.674

However, we need to take into account the fact that the witness's testimony is not the only evidence we have. We also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, which lowers the probability of H. Using Bayes' theorem again, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both the witness's testimony and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E, A) = P(E|H, A) \* P(H|A) / [P(E|H, A) \* P(H|A) + P(E|¬H, A) \* P(¬H|A)]

Since the witness's testimony is independent of the fact that the person is an attacker, we have:

P(E|H, A) = P(E|H)

P(E|¬H, A) = P(E|¬H)

Substituting the values we have:

P(H|E, A) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]

P(H|E, A) ≈ 0.06 / (0.06 + 0.085)

P(H|E, A) ≈ 0.06 / 0.145

P(H|E, A) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both the witness's testimony and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
