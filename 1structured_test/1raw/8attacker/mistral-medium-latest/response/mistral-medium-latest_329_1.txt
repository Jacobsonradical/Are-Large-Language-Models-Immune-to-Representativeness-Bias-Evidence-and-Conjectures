To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events A and B, and is given by the formula:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A), given that the witness identified them as such (event B). We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
2. P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (as mentioned in statement b).
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. We are given that P(¬A) = 0.85 (as mentioned in statement b). However, we do not have the value of P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness erroneously identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. From statement a, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying heights. Since the population is equally divided between those shorter and those 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the witness makes errors in identifying heights equally in both groups. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.1 (half of the 20% error rate).

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.205

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.205 = 0.12 / 0.205 ≈ 0.585

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.585.
