To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A) and the likelihood P(B|A). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have P(A) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identified the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, P(B|¬A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, and 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.318

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.318.
