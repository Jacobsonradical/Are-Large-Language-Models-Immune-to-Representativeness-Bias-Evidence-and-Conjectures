To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.
3. The population of people who are 185 cm or taller and those who are shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, but 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says they are 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller)

We know that:
P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from point 1)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (half of the population times 15%, from point 3)

Before we can find the probability, we need to calculate P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller). This can be done using the law of total probability:

P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know that:
P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (from point 2)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (half of the population times 85%, from point 3)

Now we can calculate P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness says they are 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says they are 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.145 â‰ˆ 0.407

So the estimated probability is roughly 0.407.
