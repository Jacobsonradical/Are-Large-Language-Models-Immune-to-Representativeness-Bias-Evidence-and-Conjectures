To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the problem statement:

P(H) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time.)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Where H' is the complementary event of H (the attacker being shorter than 185 cm). We know that:

P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H') = 0.2 (The witness erred in 20% of the cases.)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8
