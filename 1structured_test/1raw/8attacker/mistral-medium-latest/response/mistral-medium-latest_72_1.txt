To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(A), and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as P(B).
2. From the information in a), we know that P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
3. From the information in a) and b), we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(B|A). Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.
4. Similarly, we can calculate the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(B|¬A). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.
5. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

6. Plugging in the values we calculated earlier, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
= 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
