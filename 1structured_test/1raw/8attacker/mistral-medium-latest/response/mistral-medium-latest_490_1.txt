To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we first need to consider the base rate of attackers' heights and then update our belief based on the witness's testimony.

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H≥185cm) and the probability of them being shorter as P(H<185cm). According to information "a", these probabilities are roughly equal, with a slight difference due to the 85% vs. 15% distribution of attackers. However, since the 85% and 15% figures refer to the proportion of attackers within each height group, rather than the absolute number of attackers, we can still assume that:

P(H≥185cm) ≈ 0.5
P(H<185cm) ≈ 0.5

Now, let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as P(Correct) and the probability of an error as P(Error). According to information "b", these probabilities are:

P(Correct) = 0.8
P(Error) = 0.2

Given this information, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony (P(H≥185cm|Witness)). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(H≥185cm|Witness) = P(Witness|H≥185cm) \* P(H≥185cm) / [P(Witness|H≥185cm) \* P(H≥185cm) + P(Witness|H<185cm) \* P(H<185cm)]

Since the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a tall person's height:

P(Witness|H≥185cm) = 0.8

However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a short person as tall:

P(Witness|H<185cm) = 0.2

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H≥185cm|Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H≥185cm|Witness) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H≥185cm|Witness) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(H≥185cm|Witness) ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
