To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

From the given information, we can identify the following probabilities:

P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from statement b)
P(not A) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from statement b)
P(B|A) = probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from statement a)
P(B|not A) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.20 (from statement a)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.281

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.281.
