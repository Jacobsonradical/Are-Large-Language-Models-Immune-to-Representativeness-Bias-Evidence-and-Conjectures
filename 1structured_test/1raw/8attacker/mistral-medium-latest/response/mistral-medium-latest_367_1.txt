To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H^c) \* P(H^c)]

From the given information, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|H^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

However, we also need to account for the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, let's update our prior probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15
P(H^c) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.2909

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2909.
