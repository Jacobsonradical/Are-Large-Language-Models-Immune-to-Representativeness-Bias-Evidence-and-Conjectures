To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, let's find the prior probability P(A). From information "a", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A). Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now, let's find the probability of the witness's testimony, P(B). To do this, we need to consider both the case when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the case when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.096 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.331

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.331.
