To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W). Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the given information, we have:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

To find P(W), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that:

1. P(¬H) = 0.5
2. P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also have information (b) stating that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information should be incorporated into our calculation of P(H). So, let's recalculate P(H) using this information:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can recalculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.29

Finally, we can recalculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the information about the distribution of attackers, is approximately 0.4138.
