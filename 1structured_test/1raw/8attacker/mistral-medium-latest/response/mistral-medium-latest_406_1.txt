To find the estimate, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where H is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and E is the witness's testimony.

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal distribution of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(not H) = 0.5
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.8889

So the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
