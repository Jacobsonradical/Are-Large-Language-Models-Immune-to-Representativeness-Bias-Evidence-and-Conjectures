To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: Witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
P(A): From information a, we know that 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15
P(~A): The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is P(~A) = 0.85

Next, let's find the likelihoods:
P(B|A): The witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.80
P(B|~A): The witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.20

Now, we can find P(B), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)
P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138
