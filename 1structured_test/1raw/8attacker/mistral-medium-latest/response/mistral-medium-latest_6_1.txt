To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)

However, we still need to find P(W), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Where H' denotes the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:
P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H') = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Then, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
