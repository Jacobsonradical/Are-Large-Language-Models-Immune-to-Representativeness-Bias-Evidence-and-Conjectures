To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(H185|W), where H185 means the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and W means the witness's identification.

First, let's break down the given information:

1. P(H185) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
2. P(Attack|H<185) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm.)
3. P(Attack|H185) = 0.15 (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.)
4. P(W|H185) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person's height is 185 cm or taller.)
5. P(W|H<185) = 0.2 (The witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm.)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H185|W) = P(W|H185) \* P(H185) / [P(W|H185) \* P(H185) + P(W|H<185) \* P(H<185)]

Substitute the given probabilities:

P(H185|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5 \* 0.85/0.15)]
P(H185|W) = (0.4) / [(0.4) + (0.057 \* 5.67)]
P(H185|W) ≈ 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.32]
P(H185|W) ≈ 0.4 / 0.72
P(H185|W) ≈ 0.5556
