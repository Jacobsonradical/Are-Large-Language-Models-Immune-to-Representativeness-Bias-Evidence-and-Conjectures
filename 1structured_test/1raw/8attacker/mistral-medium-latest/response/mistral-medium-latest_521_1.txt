To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* $H$ as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* $W$ as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding the probability $P(H|W)$, which means the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

$P(H|W) = \frac{P(W|H) \times P(H)}{P(W)}$

From information "a", we know that:

* $P(H) = 0.5$ (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
* $P(W|H) = 1$ (Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness always correctly identifies them, the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller is 1.)

From information "b", we know that:

* $P(W|\neg H) = 0.2$ (The witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm.)

Since $P(W) = P(W|H) \times P(H) + P(W|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)$, we have:

$P(W) = 1 \times 0.5 + 0.2 \times 0.5 = 0.6$

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

$P(H|W) = \frac{1 \times 0.5}{0.6} \approx 0.833$

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.833.

Answer: {probability: 0.833}
