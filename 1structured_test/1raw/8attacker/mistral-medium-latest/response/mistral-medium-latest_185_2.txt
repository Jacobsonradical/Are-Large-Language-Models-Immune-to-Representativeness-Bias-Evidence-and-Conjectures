To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference to combine the witness's testimony and the prior probability of an attacker's height.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided:

* P(W|H) = 0.8, the witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller
* P(H) = 0.5, the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (equal population sizes)

We need to find P(W|~H) and P(~H) to calculate P(W).

* P(W|~H) = 0.2, the witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm
* P(~H) = 0.5, the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (equal population sizes)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
       = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5
       = 0.4 + 0.1
       = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
            = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
            = 0.8

However, we should also consider the information about the distribution of attackers. We know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller should be lower than 0.5. Let's denote this revised probability as P'(H).

* P'(H) = 0.15

Using the updated prior probability, we can recalculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P'(H) + P(W|~H) \* P'(~H)
       = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       ≈ 0.29

Now we can find the revised P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P'(H) / P(W)
            = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
            ≈ 0.41

So the revised estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering both the witness's testimony and the distribution of attackers, is approximately 0.41.
