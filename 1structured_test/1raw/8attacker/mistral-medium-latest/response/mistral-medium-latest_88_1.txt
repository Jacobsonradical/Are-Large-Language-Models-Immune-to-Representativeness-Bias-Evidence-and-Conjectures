To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, E is the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and ~H is the complementary event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. However, this information does not affect the calculation of P(H) or P(~H), since it applies only to the population of attackers, not the general population.

Therefore, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.889 or 88.9%.
