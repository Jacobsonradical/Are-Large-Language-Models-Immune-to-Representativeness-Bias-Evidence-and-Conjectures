To find the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information a, P(A) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075)
- P(B) as the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from information b, P(B|A) = 0.8)
- P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (from information b, P(B|¬A) = 0.2)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness reported the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.925)] ≈ 0.243 or 24.3%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.243.
