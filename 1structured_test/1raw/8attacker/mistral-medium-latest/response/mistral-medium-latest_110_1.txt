Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, this information is not needed to calculate P(H|W) because we are already using the witness's testimony in our calculation.

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8889}
