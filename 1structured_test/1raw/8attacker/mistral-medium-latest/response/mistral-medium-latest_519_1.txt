To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided. Let's first analyze the data:

1.According to a, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability distribution for the attacker's height.

2.According to b, a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, the witness is not always accurate. They correctly identify a person's height 80% of the time and make errors 20% of the time.

To combine these pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
H = the attacker being 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We're given P(H) = 0.15 and P(E|H) = 0.80. We need to find P(E) in order to calculate P(H|E).

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, P(E|not H) = 0.20. And P(not H) = 0.85 (from a).

So, P(E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
