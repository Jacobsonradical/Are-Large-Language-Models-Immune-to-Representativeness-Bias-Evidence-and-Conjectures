To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the information provided:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and the witness would make an error in identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888...

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.89.
