To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define our hypothesis H as "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and the evidence E as "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller". We want to find the probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

We are given the following information:

* P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those who are shorter than 185 cm)
* P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* P(¬H) = 0.5 (the population of people who are shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size to those who are 185 cm or taller)

We can also find P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

However, we need to adjust our probabilities to account for the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So we have:

* P(H) = 0.15
* P(¬H) = 0.85

Now we can find P(E|¬H):

P(E|¬H) = 0.2 \* (0.5 / 0.85) = 0.1176

Finally, we can find P(E):

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.1176 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.1936

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.1936 ≈ 0.619

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.619.
