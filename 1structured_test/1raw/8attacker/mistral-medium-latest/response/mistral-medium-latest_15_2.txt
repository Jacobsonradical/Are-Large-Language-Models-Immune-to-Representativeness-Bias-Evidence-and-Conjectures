To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.5 (from statement a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person, from statement b)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall, from statement b)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

First, we find P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
        = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
        = 0.4 / 0.5
        = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
