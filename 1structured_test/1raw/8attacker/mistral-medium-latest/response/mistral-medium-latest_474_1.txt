To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B is the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, let's find P(B|A): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(A) = 0.5.

Now, let's find P(B): the probability of the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We can find this by considering two cases:

1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies their height. The probability of this case is P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4.
2. The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly identifies their height. The probability of this case is P(B|not A) \* P(not A). According to the information provided, the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(not A) = 0.5. Therefore, the probability of this case is 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.1.

Since these are the only two possible cases, we have P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8.

However, we also need to take into account the information provided in statement b: 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than 0.5, and we should adjust our estimate accordingly.

Let's assume that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is P(A) = 0.15. Then, using the same calculation as before, we can find:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|not A) = 0.2
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.28.

Therefore, using Bayes' theorem, we can find:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the prior probability of attackers being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.43.
