To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the given information, we know that:

1. P(A) = 0.5: The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
2. P(¬A) = 0.5: This is simply 1 - P(A).
3. P(B|A) = 1: If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify them as such (there are no errors in this case since the witness is correct 80% of the time and the problem states that there are no false positives).
4. P(B|¬A) = 0.2: The witness correctly identifies the height of people shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time, which means they erroneously identify them as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.5 / (0.5 + 0.1) = 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.833

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.833.
