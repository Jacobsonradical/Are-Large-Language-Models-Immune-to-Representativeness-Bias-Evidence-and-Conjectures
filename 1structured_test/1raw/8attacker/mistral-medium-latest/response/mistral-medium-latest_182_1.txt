To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker was 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence is the witness's testimony (E).

First, let's estimate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) based on the information in statement a:

Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can estimate that about 15/(15+85) = 0.15 of the population are attackers who are 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's estimate the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(E|H)) and given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (P(E|~H)) based on the information in statement b:

P(E|H) = the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(E|~H) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.2

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
= 0.48

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.48}.
