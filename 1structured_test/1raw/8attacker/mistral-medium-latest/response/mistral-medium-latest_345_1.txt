To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(E|~H) as the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to information b.
P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker not being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)

P(H|E) = 0.8 / 1

P(H|E) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
