To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm.

Given that P(A) = 0.5 (from information b) and P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a), P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from information a), we can calculate P(B) as:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
