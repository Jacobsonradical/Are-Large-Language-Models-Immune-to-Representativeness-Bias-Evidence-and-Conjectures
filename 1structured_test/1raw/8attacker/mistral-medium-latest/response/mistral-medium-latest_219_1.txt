To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information given, we know that:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(~W|H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those shorter than 185 cm)
P(~H) = 0.5

However, we also know that:

P(W|~H) ≠ 0 (the witness can still incorrectly identify short people as tall)

To find P(W|~H), we can use the fact that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and the witness errs in 20% of cases. Therefore:

P(W|~H) = 0.2 \* (0.85 / 0.5) = 0.34

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.34 \* 0.5)] ≈ 0.645

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.645.
