To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

where:
H is the hypothesis "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
E is the evidence "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller"
¬H is the negation of H, "the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm"
¬E is the negation of E, "the witness identified the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm"

From the information given, we have:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

However, we need to adjust P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) to take into account that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B be the event "the attacker is under 185 cm". Then we have:

P(E|H) = P(E|H ∩ A) \* P(A|H) + P(E|H ∩ B) \* P(B|H)
= P(E|H) \* 1 + P(E|¬H) \* 0 (since P(B|H) = 0)
= 0.8

P(E|¬H) = P(E|¬H ∩ A) \* P(A|¬H) + P(E|¬H ∩ B) \* P(B|¬H)
= P(E|H) \* 0.15 + P(E|¬H) \* 0.85
= 0.12

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.12 \* 0.5]
= 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.12]
= 0.8 / 0.92
≈ 0.87

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.87.
