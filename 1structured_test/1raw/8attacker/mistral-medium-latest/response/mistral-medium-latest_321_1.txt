To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

Where:
H = the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E = the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(H|E) = ? (what we want to find)

However, we still need P(E) to apply Bayes' theorem. We can find P(E) by:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H)
P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

Since P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5 and the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(E|not H) = 0.2. Therefore:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

But we also have the information about the attackers: 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So we should update our prior probability P(H) with this new information:

P(H) = 0.15

So, using Bayes' theorem again with the updated prior probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24

{probability: 0.24}
