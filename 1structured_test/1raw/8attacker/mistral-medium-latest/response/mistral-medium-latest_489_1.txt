To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Now let's find each term:

1. P(W|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
2. P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, this probability is around 0.5.
3. P(W|¬H): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. This is given as 20%.
4. P(¬H): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is also around 0.5.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

However, we also have information about the attacker population not being equal to the general population. Specifically, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to update P(H) and P(¬H) using this information:

1. P(H) = 0.15
2. P(¬H) = 0.85

Now, we can recalculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
