To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* (1 - P(A))
= 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5
= 0.5

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
= 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8}
