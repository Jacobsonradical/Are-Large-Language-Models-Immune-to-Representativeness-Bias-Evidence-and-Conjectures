To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. Here are the steps to calculate the probability:

1. Define the events:
	* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
	* Let B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
2. Calculate the prior probabilities:
	* From the information provided, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is P(A) = 0.5.
	* We also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is P(A|Attacker) = 0.15.
3. Calculate the likelihood:
	* The witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(B|A) = 0.8.
	* Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(B|¬A) = 0.2.
4. Apply Bayes' theorem:
	* The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
	* Substituting the values we calculated earlier, we get: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.286 or 28.6%.
