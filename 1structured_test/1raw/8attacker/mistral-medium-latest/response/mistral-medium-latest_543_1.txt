To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')]

Where H' denotes the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(H') = 0.5
* P(W|H') = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, but they still identify them as 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.88888888889

However, we also need to consider the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information should be incorporated into our estimate of P(H).

Let's denote:

* A: the event that the attacker is an attacker

We want to find P(H|A, W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such and that they are an attacker.

Using Bayes' theorem again:

P(H|A, W) = P(W|H, A) \* P(H|A) / [P(W|H, A) \* P(H|A) + P(W|H', A) \* P(H'|A)]

We already know P(W|H) and P(W|H') from the previous calculation, and we can assume that the witness's ability to judge height is not affected by whether or not the person is an attacker, so:

* P(W|H, A) = P(W|H) = 0.8
* P(W|H', A) = P(W|H') = 0.2

We also know that:

* P(H|A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(H'|A) = 0.85

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|A, W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.41379310345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414, or 41.4%.
