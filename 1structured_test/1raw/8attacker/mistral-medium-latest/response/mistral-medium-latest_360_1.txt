To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's determine the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) based on the population distribution given in point b:
P(H) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's use Bayes' theorem to update this prior probability with the witness's testimony, given in point a. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:
- P(H|W) is the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony
- P(W|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 80% or 0.8)
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm (which is 85% or 0.85)
- P(W|~H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 20% or 0.2)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.357}
