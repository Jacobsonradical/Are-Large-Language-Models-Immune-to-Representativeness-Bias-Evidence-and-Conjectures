To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Here:

- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person)
- P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a short person)
- P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.85 / 1 = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't have P(B|¬A) directly. We can find it using the given information that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm:

- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)

Now we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
