To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is given by Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't know P(W) directly. We can find it using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We know that:
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

So, P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the information in statement (b) about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. If we let A represent the event that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, then:

P(A) = 0.15

Since H and A represent the same event in this context, we should update our estimate of P(H) using this information. The probability P(W|H) should also be updated to reflect the witness's accuracy when identifying attackers specifically. However, the given information doesn't provide enough data to calculate P(W|A), so we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem with the updated probabilities.

Nevertheless, we can still estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by considering the witness's accuracy and the prevalence of attackers who are 185 cm or taller:

probability: 0.15 \* 0.8 = 0.12

This estimate takes into account both the witness's testimony and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, it assumes that the witness's accuracy is the same for identifying attackers specifically as it is for identifying people in general, which might not be the case.

Please note that this is an approximation and not a precise calculation, as we don't have enough information to determine P(W|A) directly.
