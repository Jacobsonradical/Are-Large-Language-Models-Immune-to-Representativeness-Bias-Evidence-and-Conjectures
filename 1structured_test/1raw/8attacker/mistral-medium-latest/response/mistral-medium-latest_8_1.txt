{probability: 0.252, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's call the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, A, and the event of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, B.
2. We want to find the probability of A given B, P(A|B).
3. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
4. From information "a", P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
5. From information "b", P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
6. We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.
7. P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
8. From information "a", P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
9. P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size)
10. P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5
11. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.252

 Note: This estimate does not take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm (information "b"). If we consider this information, we might need to adjust our prior probability P(A) and recalculate the posterior probability P(A|B). However, without knowing the relationship between the general population and the population of attackers, it's difficult to make this adjustment accurately.
