To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the events are "attacker is 185 cm or taller" (denoted as H) and "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller" (denoted as W). We want to find the probability P(H|W), given the information provided.

First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(H). From the information in a), there are equal numbers of people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller in the population. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(H) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W|H). From the information in b), the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time. So, P(W|H) = 0.8.

Now we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, P(W|¬H). Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, this means that they incorrectly identify a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. So, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values we found:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(H|W) = 0.08 / [0.08 + 0.17]

P(H|W) = 0.08 / 0.25

P(H|W) = 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.32.

{probability: 0.32}
