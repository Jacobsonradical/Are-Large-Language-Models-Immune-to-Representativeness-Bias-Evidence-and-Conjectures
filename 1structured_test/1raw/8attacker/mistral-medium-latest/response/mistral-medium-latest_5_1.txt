To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (W).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Let's analyze the given information:

1. P(H): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume P(H) = 0.5.
2. P(¬H): The probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since P(H) = 0.5, we have P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.
3. P(W|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8.
4. P(W|¬H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H|W) = [(0.8 \* 0.5)] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8889

{probability: 0.8889}
