To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as H and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W. Then, we want to find P(H|W).

By Bayes' theorem,

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the given information,

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬W|H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 0.5
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying the height as 185 cm or taller for people shorter than 185 cm, and this happens 20% of the time)

However, we need to adjust P(W|¬H) to account for the fact that only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller and 85% are shorter. Since the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller for people shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time, we can find the probability of the witness identifying a short attacker as 185 cm or taller by multiplying this error rate by the proportion of short attackers:

P(W|¬H) = 0.2 \* (85/100) = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.17 \* 0.5)] ≈ 0.787

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.787.
