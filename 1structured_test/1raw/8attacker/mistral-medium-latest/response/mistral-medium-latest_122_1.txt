To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the events are:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
2. P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (since the population of people 185 cm or taller and those shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

However, we don't have the value of P(B) directly. To find it, we can calculate P(B|¬A) and P(¬A), and then use the fact that P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A):

1. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)
2. P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
    = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)
    = 0.06 + 0.085
    = 0.145

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.145
       ≈ 0.407

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.407.
