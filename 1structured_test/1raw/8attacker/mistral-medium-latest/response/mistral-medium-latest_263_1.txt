To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:
H = the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
E = the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height of people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified the height of people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we should adjust our prior probabilities as follows:

P(H|A) = 0.15, where A represents the event that the person is an attacker
P(not H|A) = 0.85

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H|E,A) = P(E|H,A) \* P(H|A) / [P(E|H,A) \* P(H|A) + P(E|not H,A) \* P(not H|A)]
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
