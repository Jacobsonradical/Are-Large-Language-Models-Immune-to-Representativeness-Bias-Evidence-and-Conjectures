To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the conditional probability P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies people 185 cm or taller as being so)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.5 / [0.5 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.5 / 0.6
P(A|B) = 0.5 \* (1/0.6)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8333

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8333.
