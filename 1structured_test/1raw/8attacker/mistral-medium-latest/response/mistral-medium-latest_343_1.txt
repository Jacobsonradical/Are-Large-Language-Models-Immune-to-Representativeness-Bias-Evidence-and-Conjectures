To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the given information, we can determine the following probabilities:

P(H) = probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~H) = probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)

P(W|H) = probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall attacker = 0.80 (from information a)
P(W|~H) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall = 0.20 (from information a)

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.398

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.398.
