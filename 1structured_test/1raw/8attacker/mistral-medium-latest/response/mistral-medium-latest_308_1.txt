To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy rate)

Now we need to find P(W|H') and P(H'), where H' denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(H') = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(W|H') = 0.2 (witness's error rate)

Next, we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')
   = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)
   = 0.4 + 0.1
   = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
       = 0.4 / 0.5
       = 0.8

However, this calculation does not take into account the information about the proportion of attackers being shorter or taller than 185 cm (which is given by 85% and 15%, respectively). To incorporate this information, we should update our prior probabilities P(H) and P(H').

Let's denote:
A: the event that the attacker is indeed an attacker

Now, we have:

P(H|A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(H'|A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Since we are interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are an attacker and the witness identified them as such, we should use these updated probabilities in our calculation of P(H|W):

P(H|A) = 0.15
P(H') = 1 - P(H|A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now let's recalculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H|A) + P(W|H') \* P(H'|A)
   = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the updated P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both the witness's accuracy and the proportion of attackers being shorter or taller than 185 cm, is approximately 0.4138.
