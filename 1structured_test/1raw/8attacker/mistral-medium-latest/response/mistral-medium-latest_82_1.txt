To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From information (a), we know that:
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

From information (b), we know that:
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
