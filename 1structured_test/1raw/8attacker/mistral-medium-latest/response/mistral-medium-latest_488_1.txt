To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where H is the hypothesis (the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller), E is the evidence (the witness's testimony), P(H|E) is the posterior probability (what we want to find), P(E|H) is the likelihood (the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis), P(H) is the prior probability, and P(E) is the marginal likelihood (the probability of observing the evidence regardless of the hypothesis).

From piece "a", we know that:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

From piece "b", we know that:
P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

We also need to find P(E|~H) (the probability of the witness identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm):

P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

The marginal likelihood P(E) can be calculated as:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

Since P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5, we have:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can calculate the desired probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, this probability does not take into account the information from piece "a" about the distribution of attackers' heights. To incorporate this information, we need to adjust the prior probability P(H) using the attacker-specific height distribution:

P'(H) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate the adjusted posterior probability:

P'(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P'(H) / [P(E|H) \* P'(H) + P(E|~H) \* P'(~H)]

Since P'(~H) = 1 - P'(H) = 0.85, we have:

P'(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3855

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3855.
