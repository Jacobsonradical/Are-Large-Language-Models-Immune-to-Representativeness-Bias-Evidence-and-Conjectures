To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find some other probabilities:

1. P(H): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From information b, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.
2. P(E|H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From information a, the witness correctly identifies the height of someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. P(E|¬H): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller. From information a, the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(E|¬H) = 0.2.
4. P(¬H): The prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From information b, we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so P(¬H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

After calculating, we get:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.395

{probability: 0.395}
