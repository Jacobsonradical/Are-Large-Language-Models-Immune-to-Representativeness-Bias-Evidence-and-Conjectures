To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find some other probabilities:

1. P(H): According to information (a), the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Since attackers are a subset of this population, we can assume P(H) = 0.5.
2. P(W|H): According to information (b), when the person is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies their height 80% of the time. So, P(W|H) = 0.8.
3. P(W|¬H): According to information (b), when the person is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies their height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. So, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in our values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
