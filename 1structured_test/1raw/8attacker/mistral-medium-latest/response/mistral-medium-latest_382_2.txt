To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from statement a, P(A) = 0.15)
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are (from statement b, P(B|A) = 0.8)
P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not (from statement b, P(B|¬A) = 0.2)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

First, we find P(¬A), which is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138
