To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:

1. P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
   Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(A) = 0.5

2. P(¬A) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
   P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

3. P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
   The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8

4. P(B|¬A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
   The witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
