To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the problem, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (from information a)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (from information b)

We want to find P(A|W). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|W) = 0.8

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
