To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (our goal is to find this value)
- P(B) as the probability of a witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as 185 cm or taller

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm is roughly equal in size)
P(A) = 0.5 (same as above)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

However, we also need to take into account that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we should adjust P(A) and P(¬A):

P(A) = 0.15
P(¬A) = 0.85

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.2889.
