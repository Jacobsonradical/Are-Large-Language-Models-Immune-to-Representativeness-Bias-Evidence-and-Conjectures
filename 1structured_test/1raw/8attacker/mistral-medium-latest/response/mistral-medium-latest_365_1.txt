To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
