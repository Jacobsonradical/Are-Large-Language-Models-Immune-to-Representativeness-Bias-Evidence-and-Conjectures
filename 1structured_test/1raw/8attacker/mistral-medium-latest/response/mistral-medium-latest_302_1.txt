To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define some events:

1. Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, written as P(A|B). First, let's find the probabilities of some other events:

1. P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given by the prior information: P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal).
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller: P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
3. P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal).
4. P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
