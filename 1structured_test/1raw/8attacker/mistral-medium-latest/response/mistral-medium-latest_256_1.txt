To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the given information, we know:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 1 (since the witness always identifies people who are 185 cm or taller correctly)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.5 / [0.5 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.5 / 0.6
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8333

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8333.
