To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we need to find P(A) and P(B|A). From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Next, we need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.8889}
