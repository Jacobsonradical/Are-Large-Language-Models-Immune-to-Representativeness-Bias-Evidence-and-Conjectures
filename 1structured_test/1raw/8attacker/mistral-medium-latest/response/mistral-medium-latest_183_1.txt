To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a person's height)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in our values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
