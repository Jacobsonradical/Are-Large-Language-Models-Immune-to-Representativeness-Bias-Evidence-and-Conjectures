To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information, we know:

- P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
