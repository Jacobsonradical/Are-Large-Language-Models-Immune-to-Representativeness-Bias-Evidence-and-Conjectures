To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to find the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) given evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's define the following events:

* H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: The witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness testified that it was.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also need to find P(W), which is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We are given that P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm) and P(not H) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.4

However, we also have the additional information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of H being true (i.e., the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) should be adjusted to reflect this fact.

Let's call this new probability P'(H). We are given that P'(H) = 0.15.

We also need to adjust the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Let's call this probability P'(W|not H).

Since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, they incorrectly identify the height as being 185 cm or taller for people who are actually shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. However, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the witness will have fewer opportunities to make this error. In fact, the probability of this error is:

P'(W|not H) = (number of errors when the person is shorter than 185 cm) / (number of people who are shorter than 185 cm and commit attacks)

= (0.2 \* 0.5 \* N) / (0.85 \* N)

where N is the total number of people in the population.

Simplifying, we get:

P'(W|not H) = 0.2 / 1.7 = 0.1176

Now we can use Bayes' theorem again to find P'(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness testified that it was and taking into account the new information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller:

P'(H|W) = P'(W|H) \* P'(H) / [P'(W|H) \* P'(H) + P'(W|not H) \* P'(not H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P'(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1176 \* 0.85)]

= 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.0998)

= 0.09 / 0.1898

= 0.474

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony and the new information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.474.
