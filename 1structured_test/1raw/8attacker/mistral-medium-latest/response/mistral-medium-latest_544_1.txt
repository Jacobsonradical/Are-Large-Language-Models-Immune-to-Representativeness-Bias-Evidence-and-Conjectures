To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(~H) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given in point a, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can set:

P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85

Let's denote E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find the posterior probability P(H|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information given in point b, we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, we can set:

P(E|H) = 0.8
P(E|~H) = 0.2

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.429

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.429.
