To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

From the problem statement, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
* P(~H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

We can find P(E) by using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5
= 0.5

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
= 0.8

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
