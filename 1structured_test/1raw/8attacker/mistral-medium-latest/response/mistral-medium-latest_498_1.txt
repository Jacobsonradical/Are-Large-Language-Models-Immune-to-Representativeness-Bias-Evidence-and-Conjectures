To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information "a".
P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information "b".
P(E|¬H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to information "b".

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is:

{probability: 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8/1 = 0.8}
