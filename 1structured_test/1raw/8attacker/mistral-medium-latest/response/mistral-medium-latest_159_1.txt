To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information given in both points "a" and "b". 

First, let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From point "a", we know that P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).

From point "b", we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time) and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now, we want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
