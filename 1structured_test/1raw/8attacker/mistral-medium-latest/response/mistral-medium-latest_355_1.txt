To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

P(~H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(W|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 1.6

However, the result is greater than 1, which is not valid for a probability. This inconsistency might be due to the information provided or an error in calculation. Considering the information about the witness's accuracy and the distribution of people's heights, the probability should be between 0 and 1.

Given the information provided, it's not possible to accurately determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. However, if we ignore the inconsistency, the calculated value (1.6) is not a valid probability.
