To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the prevalence of attackers in each height group. Here's how we can calculate it:

1. First, let's find the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker and 185 cm or taller tall (true positive rate). Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying tall people, this probability is 0.8.
2. Next, let's find the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are an attacker and shorter than 185 cm (false positive rate). This probability is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2.
3. Now, we need to consider the prevalence of attackers in each height group. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can represent this as P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 and P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15.
4. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such (P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm)). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm)

5. The probability of the witness saying a person is 185 cm or taller can be calculated as:

P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) \* P(Attacker < 185 cm)

6. Plugging in the values from steps 1-3, we get:

P(Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

7. Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness says ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.435

Final answer: {probability: 0.435}
