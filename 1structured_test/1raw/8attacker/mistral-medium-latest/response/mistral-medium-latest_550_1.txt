To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness said 185+ cm) = (P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)) / P(Witness said 185+ cm)

From the information given, we know that:

P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.5 (the general population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to people under 185 cm)

However, we also know that:

P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.5 (again, the general population is roughly equal in size)

We can use these probabilities to calculate P(Witness said 185+ cm) by considering both possible heights of the attacker:

P(Witness said 185+ cm) = P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is under 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is under 185 cm)
P(Witness said 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness said 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, this estimate assumes that the witness's ability to judge height is unbiased and that the distribution of attacker heights in the general population is the same as the distribution of heights among people who commit crimes. The information in (b) suggests that this may not be the case, as 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 50% of the general population is under 185 cm.

To account for this, we can adjust our prior probability for the attacker's height based on the information in (b). Specifically, we can use the fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller to update our prior probability:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15

We can then recalculate P(Witness said 185+ cm) using this updated prior probability:

P(Witness said 185+ cm) = P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness said 185+ cm | Attacker is under 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is under 185 cm)
P(Witness said 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem again to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the updated prior probability:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness said 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
