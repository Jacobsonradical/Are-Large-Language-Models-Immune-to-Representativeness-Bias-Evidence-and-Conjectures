To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as P(E). We want to find the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence, P(H|E).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

We are given that P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. We are also given that P(E|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

To find P(E), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the case where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, so the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, we have:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.17 \* 0.5
= 0.585

Finally, we can find P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.585
â‰ˆ 0.684

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.684.
