To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, let's find the prior probability P(H). According to information a, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Since the overall attacker rate is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact probability P(H). However, assuming that the attacker is a random person from the population, we can infer that P(H) is less than 0.5 but higher than 0.15. So, let's estimate P(H) to be around 0.3.

Next, let's find P(W|H) and P(W|¬H). According to information b, the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. So, P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in our estimated values:

P(H|W) = [(0.8) \* (0.3)] / [(0.8) \* (0.3) + (0.2) \* (0.7)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.75

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.75.
