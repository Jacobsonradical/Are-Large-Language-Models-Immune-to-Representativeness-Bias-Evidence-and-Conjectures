To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem.

First, let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the conditional probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

From the given information:

P(A) = probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (from a)
P(not A) = probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.5

P(B|A) = probability of witness identifying an attacker of height 185 cm or taller as such = 0.8 (from b)
P(B|not A) = probability of witness incorrectly identifying an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (from b)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / [(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.2 * 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
