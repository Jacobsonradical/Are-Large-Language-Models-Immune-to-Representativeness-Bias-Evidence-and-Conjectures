To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.

P(W|H) as the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.

P(W|~H) as the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information b.

P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.5 according to information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to calculate P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(H|W) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.8}.
