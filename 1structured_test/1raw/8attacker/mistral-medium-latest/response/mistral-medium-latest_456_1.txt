To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.5 (from statement a)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (from statement b, when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies their height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (from statement b, when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly identifies their height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying the equation:

P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

Calculating the probability:

P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(H|W) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
