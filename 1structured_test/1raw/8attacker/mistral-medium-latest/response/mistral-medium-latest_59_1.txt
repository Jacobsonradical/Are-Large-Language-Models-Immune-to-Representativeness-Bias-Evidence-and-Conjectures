To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is equal to the probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of observing the evidence.

In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) can be estimated from the information in statement b, which tells us that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. The probability of observing the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) can be estimated from the information in statement a, which tells us that the witness correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. However, we also need to know the probability of observing the evidence given the alternative hypothesis (P(E|not H)), which can be estimated from the information in statement a as well. Since the witness errs in 20% of cases, and since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that the witness incorrectly identifies people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 10% of the time (since the witness makes errors in 20% of cases, and since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify half of those cases).

Using this information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)]

This simplifies to:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.085)

Which is approximately equal to:

P(H|E) = 0.59

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.59.

Answer: {probability: 0.59}
