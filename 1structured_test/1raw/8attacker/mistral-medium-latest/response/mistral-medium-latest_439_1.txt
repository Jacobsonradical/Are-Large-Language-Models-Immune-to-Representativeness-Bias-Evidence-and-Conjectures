To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(H) = 0.5 (from information b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, but since the general population is equally divided, this means that among attackers, the probability is twice as high)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information a, the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

First, we need to find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.
