To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define some events:
A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

However, we should also consider the prior information about the attackers being more likely to be shorter than 185 cm (85% vs. 15%). This information suggests that the witness's testimony might be biased by the fact that most attackers are shorter, so the witness might be more likely to erroneously identify a shorter attacker as taller than they are.

Taking this into account, we can adjust our estimate of P(B|not A):

P'(B|not A) = 0.2 + 0.7 \* 0.15 (additional error due to the prior information)
P'(B|not A) = 0.2 + 0.105
P'(B|not A) ≈ 0.305

Now recalculate P(A|B) using the updated value of P'(B|not A):

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.305 \* 0.5]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1525)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.7273

Taking both the witness's accuracy and the prior information about attackers' heights into account, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.7273.
