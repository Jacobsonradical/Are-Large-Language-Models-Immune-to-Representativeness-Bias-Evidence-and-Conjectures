To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

- P(T): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(S): the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(T|S), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness says so.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(T|S) = [P(S|T) \* P(T)] / P(S)

From the given information:

- P(S|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(T) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We still need to calculate P(S), the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since P(S) = P(S and T) + P(S and not T), we can calculate it as follows:

- P(S and T) = P(S|T) \* P(T) = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4
- P(S and not T) = P(S|not T) \* P(not T) = 0.2 \* 0.5 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(S):

P(S) = P(S and T) + P(S and not T) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(T|S):

P(T|S) = [P(S|T) \* P(T)] / P(S) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness says so, is 0.8.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.8}
