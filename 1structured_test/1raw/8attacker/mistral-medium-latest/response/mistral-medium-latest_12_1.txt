{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of their being correct is 0.80.
2. Next, we need to find the probability of the witness being incorrect when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of their being incorrect is 0.20.
3. However, when the witness is incorrect, they are actually identifying a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness being incorrect and still identifying an attacker as being 185 cm or taller is 0.20 x 0.85 = 0.17.
4. Now, we need to find the overall probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This can be done by adding the probability of the witness being correct (0.80) and the probability of the witness being incorrect and still identifying an attacker as being 185 cm or taller (0.17). So, the overall probability is 0.80 + 0.17 = 0.97.
5. However, since we want to find the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the fact that only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.97 x 0.15 = 0.56.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.56.
