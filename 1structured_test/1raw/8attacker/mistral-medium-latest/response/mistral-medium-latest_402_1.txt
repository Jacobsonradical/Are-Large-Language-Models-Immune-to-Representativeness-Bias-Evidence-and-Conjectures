To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights.

1. First, let's find the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller: P(Correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
2. Next, let's find the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller: P(Incorrect | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2
3. Since we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the prior probabilities: P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (P(Correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / (P(Correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Incorrect | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm))
5. Plugging in the values:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.4286

{probability: 0.4286}
