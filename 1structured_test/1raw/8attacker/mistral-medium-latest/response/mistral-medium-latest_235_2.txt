To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let's denote:

* H as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E as the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Then, Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:

* P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (what we want to find)
* P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the accuracy of the witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
* P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the overall accuracy of the witness)

Using the information provided, we can estimate these probabilities as follows:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, but only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
* P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H) (using the law of total probability)
* P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and the witness would err when identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)
* P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.888888888889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.89.
