To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
3. P(¬A) = 0.5 (Complementary probability)
4. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

First, we need to calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we were asked to provide our estimate as a number between 0 and 1. Therefore:

{probability: 0.8}
