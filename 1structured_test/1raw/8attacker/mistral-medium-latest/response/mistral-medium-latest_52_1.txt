To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information given:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
3. P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
4. P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

However, there is a second piece of information that might affect our estimate:

5. Only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller

This information suggests that the prior probability of the attacker being tall should be lower than our initial assumption (0.5). But since we don't have an updated population distribution, we can't adjust our calculation accordingly.

Using only the information provided by the witness, the estimated probability is 0.8889. However, if we could incorporate the information about the attacker population, our estimate might be lower.

{probability: 0.8889}

Please note that this estimate is based on the witness's testimony alone and does not take into account the additional information about the attacker population. If you want a more accurate estimate, you would need more information about the population distribution or a way to incorporate the attacker population information into your calculation.
