To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following information:

* P(B|A) = 0.8, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
* P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075, which is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is calculated as the probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the general population (0.5) multiplied by the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller in the general population (0.15).

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A denotes the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following information:

* P(B|¬A) = 0.2, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are not 185 cm or taller.
* P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425, which is the probability that an attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is calculated as the probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the general population (0.5) multiplied by the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm given that they are shorter than 185 cm in the general population (0.85).

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.075 + 0.2 \* 0.425 = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.075 / 0.145 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.414.
