{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's estimate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on information (a): 15% or 0.15.
2. Next, let's consider the witness's testimony (information (b)). The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
3. To find the posterior probability (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness's testimony) = (P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness's testimony)

4. We know P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from step 1).
5. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
6. To find P(Witness's testimony), we need to calculate the probability of the witness's testimony occurring, whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller or not. We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(Witness's testimony) = P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

7. We already know P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. Since the attacker is either 185 cm or taller or not, P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85.
8. When the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, the witness errs 20% of the time, so P(Witness's testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.
9. Plugging these values into the equation from step 6, we get:

P(Witness's testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

10. Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem (from step 3):

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness's testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.56.
