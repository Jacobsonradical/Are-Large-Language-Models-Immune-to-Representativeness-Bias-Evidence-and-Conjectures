To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as E. We want to find the probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

From the information given, we can estimate the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(E|H) = 0.96 (since the witness correctly identifies the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and there is a 0.85 \* 0.8 chance that an attacker who is 185 cm or taller will be correctly identified, and a 0.15 \* 0.2 chance that an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm will be incorrectly identified as being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider the possible ways that the witness could have testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the probabilities of those events. There are two possibilities: (1) the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies their height, or (2) the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness incorrectly identifies their height. The probabilities of these events are:

P(E and H) = P(E|H) \* P(H) = 0.96 \* 0.5 = 0.48
P(E and not H) = P(E|not H) \* P(not H) = 0.2 \* 0.15 \* 0.5 = 0.015

Therefore, P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H) = 0.48 + 0.015 = 0.5

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.96 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.96

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.96.
