To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 0.5

P(W|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W) as follows:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
= 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
= 0.8 / 1
= 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
