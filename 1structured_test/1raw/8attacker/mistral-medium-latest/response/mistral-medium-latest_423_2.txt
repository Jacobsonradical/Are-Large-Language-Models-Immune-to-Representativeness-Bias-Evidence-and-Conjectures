To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, say A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.5) = 0.2 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we don't have P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller irrespective of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in judging the height 20% of the time, and since half the sample is shorter than 185 cm, the witness will incorrectly identify someone shorter as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.857 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.2) + (0.2 \* 0.857) = 0.3114

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.2) / 0.3114 = 0.5106

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is 0.5106.
