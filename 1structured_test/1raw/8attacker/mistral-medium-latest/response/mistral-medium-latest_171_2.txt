To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:

* H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
* P(not H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis not being true
* P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis not being true

From the information given, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(not H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
* P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred 20% of the time and the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.5, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) = 0.8889

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information changes the prior probability of the hypothesis:

* P(H) = 0.15
* P(not H) = 0.85

Using this updated prior probability, we can calculate the posterior probability again:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|E) = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4138.
