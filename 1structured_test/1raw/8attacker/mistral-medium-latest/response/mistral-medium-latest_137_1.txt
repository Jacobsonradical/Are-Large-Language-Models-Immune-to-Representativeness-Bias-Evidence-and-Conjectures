To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need to find P(~H) and P(W), which aren't provided directly. Since P(H) = 0.5, we can say P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

Now we need P(W). Since the witness makes errors 20% of the time, they will incorrectly identify short people as tall 20% of the time. So P(W|~H) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

However, this calculation does not take into account the information about the distribution of attackers (85% under 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller). To incorporate this information, we need to update our initial probability P(H). Let's denote P'(H) as the updated probability.

P'(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Now we can recalculate P(H|W) using the updated probability:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P'(H) / P(W)

Since P(W) is not affected by the change in P(H), it remains the same: P(W) = 0.5.

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.12 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.24

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the distribution of attackers, is 0.24.

{probability: 0.24}
