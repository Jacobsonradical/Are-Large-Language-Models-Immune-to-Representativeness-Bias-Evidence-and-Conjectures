{probability: 0.47, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. From statement "a", we know that 85% of the attackers are under 185 cm tall, while 15% are 185 cm or taller. In other words, the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
2. From statement "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time. However, since the witness is more likely to see people who are actually shorter than 185 cm as being shorter (85% of attackers are under 185 cm), we need to adjust the witness's accuracy based on the prior probability.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such: P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness says 185+) = P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+) / P(Witness says 185+)
4. We are given that P(Attacker is 185+) = 0.15, and P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).
5. However, we do not know P(Witness says 185+), which is the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. To calculate this, we need to consider both the cases where the witness correctly identifies a tall person and where they incorrectly identify a short person as being tall.
6. The probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller is: P(Witness says 185+) = P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+) + P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is <185+) \* P(Attacker is <185+) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24
7. Now we can calculate the posterior probability: P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness says 185+) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.47
8. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is 0.47.
