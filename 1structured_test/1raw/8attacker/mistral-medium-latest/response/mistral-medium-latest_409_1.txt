To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller. From the given information, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A), which is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's true height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), so we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A). Since P(A) = 0.15, then P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85. From the given information, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.096 / 0.29 = 0.331

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.331.
