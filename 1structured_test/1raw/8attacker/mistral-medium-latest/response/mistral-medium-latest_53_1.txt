To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.

P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 according to information b.

P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information a.

P(E|~H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
