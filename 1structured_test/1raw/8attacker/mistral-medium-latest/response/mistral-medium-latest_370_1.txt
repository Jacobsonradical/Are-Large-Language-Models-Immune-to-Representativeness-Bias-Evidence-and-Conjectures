To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = probability of the witness identifying a tall person correctly = 0.80 (from information a)
P(W|not H) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall = 0.20 (from information a)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.385

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.385.
