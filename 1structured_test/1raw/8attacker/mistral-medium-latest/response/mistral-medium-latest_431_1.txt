To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(E|~H) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to information b.
P(E) as the prior probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we need to calculate.

First, let's calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and ~H) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)
Since P(H) = 0.5, P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5. Plugging in the values, we get:
P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)
Plugging in the values, we get:
P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we need to adjust this probability to take into account the fact that attackers who are 185 cm or taller are less common than attackers who are shorter than 185 cm despite the equal population sizes. According to information a, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we need to multiply the posterior probability by this factor:

Adjusted P(H|E) = P(H|E) \* P(H|Attacker) = 0.8 \* 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12.
