To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis H (without considering the evidence)
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis H
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E

We are given the following information:

- P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

We can calculate the probability of the evidence P(E) using the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Since P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5, we have:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also need to consider the given information about the proportion of attackers who are under 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. Specifically, we are told that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of the hypothesis H (i.e., P(H)) is actually 0.15, not 0.5.

Therefore, we need to recalculate the posterior probability P(H|E) using the corrected prior probability:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence and the corrected prior probability, is:

{probability: 0.24}
