To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided:

1. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
2. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(A) = 0.5 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
3. P(¬A) = 0.5 (probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
4. However, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we should adjust the probabilities of P(A) and P(¬A) based on this new information: P(A) = 0.15, and P(¬A) = 0.85
5. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people's height, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.2903

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2903.
