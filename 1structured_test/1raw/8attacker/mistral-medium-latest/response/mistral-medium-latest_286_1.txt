To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(~A) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from information a)
P(B|~A) = probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (from information a)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.318
