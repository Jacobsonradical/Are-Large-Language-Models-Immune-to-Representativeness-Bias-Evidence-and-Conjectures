To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

- H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

First, let's find P(H). From information (a), we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. So, P(H) = 0.5.

Next, let's find P(W|H). This is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information (b), the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8.

Now we need to find P(W). This is the overall probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's true height. Using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We already have P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.5. From information (b), the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W|¬H) = 0.2. Since P(H) = 0.5, we have P(¬H) = 0.5.

So, P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5.

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
