To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will consider both pieces of information provided.

Let's denote:
P(H185) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (before considering witness testimony)
P(W|H185) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W|~H185) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From information "a", we know that:
P(H185) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

From information "b", we know that:
P(W|H185) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(W|~H185) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony:

P(H185|W) = [P(W|H185) \* P(H185)] / [P(W|H185) \* P(H185) + P(W|~H185) \* P(~H185)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H185|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H185|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H185|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

{probability: 0.8}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.
