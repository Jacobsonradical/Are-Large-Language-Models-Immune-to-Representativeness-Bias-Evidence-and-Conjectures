{probability: 0.672, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:

First, let's find the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the information available in "a". Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the prior probability as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 \* 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.1825 ≈ 0.821

Now, let's find the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller (true positive rate) and the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm (false positive rate). According to "b", these probabilities are:

True positive rate (TPR) = 0.8
False positive rate (FPR) = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (TPR \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / ((TPR \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) + (FPR \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.8 \* 0.821) / ((0.8 \* 0.821) + (0.2 \* 0.179)) ≈ 0.672

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.672.
