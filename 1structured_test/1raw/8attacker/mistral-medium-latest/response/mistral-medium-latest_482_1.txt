First, let's calculate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(A)) based on information "a". Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate:

P(A) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075

Next, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (P(A|B)). We need to find P(B|A) and P(B|¬A), which represent the probabilities of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and not 185 cm or taller, respectively.

From information "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(B|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.925)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.25

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.25.
