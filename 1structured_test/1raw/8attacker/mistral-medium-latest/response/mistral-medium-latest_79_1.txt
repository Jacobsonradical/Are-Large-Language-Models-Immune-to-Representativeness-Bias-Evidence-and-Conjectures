{probability: 0.57, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we estimate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first piece of information (a): Since 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability is 0.15.
2. Next, we want to find the posterior probability, which takes into account the new information (b) about the witness's testimony.
3. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability is equal to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood ratio, divided by the sum of the product of the prior probability and the likelihood ratio for all possible outcomes.
4. In this case, the possible outcomes are that the attacker is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller. The likelihood ratio is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, divided by the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
5. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, the likelihood ratio is (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.20 * 0.85 + 0.80 * 0.15) = 0.6.
6. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.6) / ((0.15 * 0.6) + (0.85 * 0.4)) = 0.57.
7. It's worth noting that this estimate is subject to uncertainty and should not be taken as a definitive conclusion. For example, the witness's ability to judge height may vary depending on factors such as lighting conditions, distance, and angle of view. Additionally, the prior probability estimate based on the first piece of information may not be accurate.
