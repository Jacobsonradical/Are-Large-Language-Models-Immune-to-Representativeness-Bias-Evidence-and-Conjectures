{probability: 0.47, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning behind this estimate:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.
2. Next, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on information a. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, this prior probability is 0.15.
3. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

The formula for Bayes' theorem is:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) and P(¬A) are the prior probabilities of A and not A, respectively

In our case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"
- P(A) = 0.15 (from step 2)
- P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from step 1)
- P(B|¬A) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm; this probability is 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.47

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.47.
