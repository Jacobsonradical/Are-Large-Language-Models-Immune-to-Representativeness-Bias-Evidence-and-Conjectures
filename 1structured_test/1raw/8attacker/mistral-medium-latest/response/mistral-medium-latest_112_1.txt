To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of updating probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability of A given B, denoted as P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probability of A, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller without considering the witness's testimony. According to information (a), the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability of A is P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(B|A). According to information (b), the witness correctly identifies the height of people 80% of the time. So, the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(B|¬A). According to information (b), the witness errs in 20% of the cases. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, the witness will incorrectly identify a person as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. So, the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found earlier:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4706

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4706.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.4706}
