To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

First, let's denote the probabilities:

P(A) = probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that their height is indeed 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that their height is shorter than 185 cm
P(¬A) = probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the provided information, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

Numerator = 0.4
Denominator = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

The estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
