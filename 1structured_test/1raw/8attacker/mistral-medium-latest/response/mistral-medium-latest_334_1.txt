To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H^c) \* P(H^c)]

From the given information:

P(H) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size)
P(H^c) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(W|H) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a tall person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(W|H^c) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as 185 cm or taller = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

However, we must consider the information about the distribution of attackers (85% shorter and 15% taller). So, let's update the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)):

P(H) = 0.15

Now recalculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
