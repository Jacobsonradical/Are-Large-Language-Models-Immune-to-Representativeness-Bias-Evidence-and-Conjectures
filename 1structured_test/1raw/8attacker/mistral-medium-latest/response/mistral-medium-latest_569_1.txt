To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let's define the events as follows:
Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.5 (from information b, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (complementary probability to P(A))
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness erred in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't know the prior probability P(B), which is the overall probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values:
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now that we have P(B), we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we need to consider the information in (b) about the distribution of attackers. Specifically, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to adjust our probability estimate accordingly. Let's call this adjusted probability P'(A|B):

P'(A|B) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85 \* 0.2) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.15 / 0.32 ≈ 0.46875

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering both pieces of information, is approximately 0.46875 or 46.875%.
