To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(H|attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(~H|attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can calculate it using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

First, let's calculate the denominator:
[P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)] = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we must adjust this probability to account for the fact that attackers who are 185 cm or taller are less common than shorter attackers. We can do this by multiplying P(H|W) by the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(H|attacker):

Adjusted P(H|W) = P(H|W) \* P(H|attacker) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.12}
