To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided, we know:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(W), we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is incorrect. We can write:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We know that:

* P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and 20% of 1 is 0.2)

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8)(0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
