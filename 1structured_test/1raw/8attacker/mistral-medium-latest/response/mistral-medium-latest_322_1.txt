To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(¬B|A) = 0.2
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those who are shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 0.5

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

However, this calculation only takes into account the witness's testimony and the population distribution. To incorporate the information about the attacker distribution (85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller), we need to update the prior probability P(A).

Since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(A) = 0.15
P(¬A) = 0.85

Now we can calculate the revised probability P(A|B) using the updated prior:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.294
