To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B.

First, we know from information (a) that P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

Next, we need to find P(B|A) and P(B|A^c), which are the probabilities of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, respectively. From information (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|A^c) = 0.2.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A^c) \* P(A^c)]

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889.

Answer: {probability: 0.889}
