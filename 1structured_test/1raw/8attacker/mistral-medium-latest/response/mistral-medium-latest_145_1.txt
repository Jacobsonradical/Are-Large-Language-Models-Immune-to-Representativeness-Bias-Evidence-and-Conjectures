To find the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.)
2. P(B|A) = 1.0 (If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the witness will always identify the attacker correctly as being 185 cm or taller.)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. When the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, the witness still identifies them as such 20% of the time.)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given values:

P(A|B) = (1.0 \* 0.5) / [(1.0 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 1.0 / [1.0 + 0.2] = 0.8333 or 83.33%

However, since we want the probability as a number between 0 and 1, we will express it as a decimal:

{probability: 0.8333}
