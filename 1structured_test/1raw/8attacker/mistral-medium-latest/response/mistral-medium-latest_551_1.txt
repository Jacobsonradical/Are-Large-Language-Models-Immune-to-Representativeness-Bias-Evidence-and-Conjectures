To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. 

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
