To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a) and (b). We can use Bayes' theorem for this estimation.

First, let's define some events:
H: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
A: Attacker is actually an attacker (either shorter or taller)

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From information (a), P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
From information (b), P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)

We still need to find P(W|H') and P(H'), where H' is the complementary event (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm). From information (a), P(W|H') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time). From information (b), P(H') = 0.5 (the population distribution).

Now, we can find P(W):
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H') = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also need to take into account the information about the attackers (85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller). So, we should adjust our prior probability P(H) and P(H') according to this new information.

Let's rename P(H) as P'(H) = 0.15 (the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) and P(H') as P'(H') = 0.85 (the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can recalculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P'(H) + P(W|H') \* P'(H') = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.31

Finally, we can recalculate P(H|W):
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P'(H) / P(W) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.31 ≈ 0.387

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.387.
