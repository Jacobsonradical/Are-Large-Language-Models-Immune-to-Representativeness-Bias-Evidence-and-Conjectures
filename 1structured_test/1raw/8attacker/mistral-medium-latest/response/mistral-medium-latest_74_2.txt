To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (the witness's testimony) is equal to the product of the likelihood of the evidence given the event and the prior probability of the event, divided by the likelihood of the evidence.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know the following:

* The prior probability of A, P(A), is 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
* The likelihood of W given A, P(W|A), is 0.8, since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
* The likelihood of W given not A, P(W|not A), is 0.2, since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm.
* The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(A|attacker), is 0.15, and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, P(not A|attacker), is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of A given W as follows:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|not A) \* P(not A)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

P(A|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

P(A|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]

P(A|W) = 0.8 / 0.9

P(A|W) = 0.8889

However, we also need to take into account the fact that attackers who are 185 cm or taller are less common than attackers who are shorter. Therefore, we need to adjust our estimate using the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(A|attacker), which is 0.15.

To do this, we can use the following formula:

P(A|W, attacker) = P(A|W) \* P(A|attacker) / [P(A|W) \* P(A|attacker) + P(not A|W) \* P(not A|attacker)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A|W, attacker) = (0.8889 \* 0.15) / [(0.8889 \* 0.15) + (0.1111 \* 0.85)]

P(A|W, attacker) = 0.1333 / [0.1333 + 0.0938]

P(A|W, attacker) = 0.1333 / 0.2271

P(A|W, attacker) = 0.5866

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the fact that the attacker is part of the population of attackers, is 0.5866.
