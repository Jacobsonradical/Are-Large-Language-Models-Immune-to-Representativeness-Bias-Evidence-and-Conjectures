To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

Firstly, from information "a", we know that 85% of such attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability of 0.15 for an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Secondly, from information "b", we have a witness who identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. However, this witness is not perfectly accurate and makes errors 20% of the time. Since half of the people in the sample used to assess the witness's ability are 185 cm or taller, the witness will incorrectly identify someone shorter as tall 10% of the time (0.2 * 0.5).

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability with the new evidence from the witness. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In our case:
A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B represents the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From information "a", P(A) = 0.15.
From information "b", P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).

We also need to find P(B), the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of their true height. We can calculate this as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
       = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
       = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.1 \* 0.85)
       ≈ 0.225

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
        ≈ [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.225
        ≈ 0.533

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.533.
