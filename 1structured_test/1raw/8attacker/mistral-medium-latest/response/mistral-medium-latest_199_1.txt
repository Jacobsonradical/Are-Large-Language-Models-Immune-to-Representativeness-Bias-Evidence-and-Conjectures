To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a method to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here's the formula for Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

In this case, H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E represents the evidence provided by the witness.

We have the following probabilities:

1. P(H) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: From information "a", we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.
2. P(not H) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.
3. P(E|H) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller: From information "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.80.
4. P(E|not H) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm: From information "b", we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(E|not H) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]
P(H|E) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3571.
