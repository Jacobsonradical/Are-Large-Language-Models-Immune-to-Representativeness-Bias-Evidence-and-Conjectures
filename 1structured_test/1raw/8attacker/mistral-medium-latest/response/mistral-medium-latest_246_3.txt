To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). According to the information provided, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, P(A) = 0.5.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A). Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker's height. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the probability P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we found earlier:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) \* (0.5)] / [(0.8) \* (0.5) + (0.2) \* (0.5)]

Simplifying:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

However, we need to consider the bias in the attacker population given in information a. Attackers who are under 185 cm are more likely to commit such crimes (85%) than those who are 185 cm or taller (15%). To account for this bias, we can adjust our prior probability P(A) as follows:

Let's denote the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller as p, and the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm as 1-p. According to the information provided, the probability that an attacker is under 185 cm, given that they committed such a crime, is 85%, or 0.85. Therefore, we have:

P(Attacker is under 185 cm | Attacker committed the crime) = P(Attacker is under 185 cm) / P(Attacker committed the crime)

0.85 = (1-p) / [p + (1-p)]

Solving for p, we get:

p = 0.15 / 1.85 ≈ 0.081

Therefore, our adjusted prior probability P(A) = 0.081.

Using this adjusted prior probability, we can recalculate the probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8) \* (0.081)] / [(0.8) \* (0.081) + (0.2) \* (0.919)]

Simplifying:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.065 / (0.065 + 0.184) ≈ 0.258

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.258, accounting for the bias in the attacker population.
