To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating probabilities based on new information. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (let's call this event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B). We'll denote this probability as P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's plug in the given information:

1. From point a: P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
2. From point a: P(¬A) = 0.5
3. From point b: P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
4. From point b: P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases, this is the probability of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
