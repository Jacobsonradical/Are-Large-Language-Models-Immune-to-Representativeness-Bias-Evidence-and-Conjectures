To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a) and (b). Here's how we can calculate it:

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H≥185). From information (a), we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so:

P(H<185) = 0.85
P(H≥185) = 1 - P(H<185) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, let's consider the witness's testimony. We'll denote the event that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller as W. From information (b), we know the witness's accuracy:

P(W|H≥185) = 0.80 (witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|H<185) = 0.20 (witness incorrectly identifies someone who is under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, which is denoted as P(H≥185|W). We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(H≥185|W) = [P(W|H≥185) \* P(H≥185)] / [P(W|H≥185) \* P(H≥185) + P(W|H<185) \* P(H<185)]

We already have the values for P(W|H≥185), P(W|H<185), P(H≥185), and P(H<185). Plugging these values into the formula:

P(H≥185|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.36.
