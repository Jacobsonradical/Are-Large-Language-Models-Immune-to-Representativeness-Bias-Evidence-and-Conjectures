To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal to those shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't know P(W|¬H) (the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not 185 cm or taller) and P(¬H) (the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller). We can find P(¬H) because we know P(H) = 0.5, so P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying someone's height, and we know that half of the people are shorter than 185 cm, we can infer that the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller 20% \* 0.5 = 0.1 or 10% of the time. Therefore, P(W|¬H) = 0.1.

Now we need to find P(W). We can use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.1 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.05 = 0.45

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.45 = 0.44 / 0.45 ≈ 0.9778

{probability: 0.9778}
