To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the prevalence of attackers in different height categories. This is a classic problem of Bayesian inference.

Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B|A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(B|¬A) as the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

From the information provided:

- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3855 or 38.55%.
