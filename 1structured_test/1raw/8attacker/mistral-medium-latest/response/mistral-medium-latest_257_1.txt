To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's denote:

* P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and
* P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given in the problem, we know that:

* P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (since the complement of the probability of being 185 cm or taller is the probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
* P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

We also know from the information given in the problem that:

* 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, this information is not relevant to our calculation of P(A|B) since it does not take into account the witness's ability to accurately identify heights.

Using the values above, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
