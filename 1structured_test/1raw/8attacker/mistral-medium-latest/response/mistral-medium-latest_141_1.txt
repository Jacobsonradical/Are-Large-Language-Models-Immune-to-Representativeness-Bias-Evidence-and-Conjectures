To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find the prior probabilities and likelihoods based on the given information:

1. P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information a).
2. P(¬A): The probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (from information a).
3. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are, is 0.80 (from information b).
4. P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, is 0.20 (from information b).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values from above:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4286.
