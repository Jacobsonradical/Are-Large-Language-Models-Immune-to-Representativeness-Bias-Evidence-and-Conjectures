First, let's consider the information provided in statement a. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that each group makes up about 50% of the population. Given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the information provided in statement b. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and the witness's ability to judge height was assessed under similar conditions. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Given this information, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. The likelihood of the witness making an error and identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) = [P(witness testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness testimony | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness testimony | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness testimony) â‰ˆ 0.409

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.409.
