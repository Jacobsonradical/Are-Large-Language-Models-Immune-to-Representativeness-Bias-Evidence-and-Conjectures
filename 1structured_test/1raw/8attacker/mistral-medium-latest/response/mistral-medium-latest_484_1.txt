To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. Our goal is to find the probability P(A|B).

First, we know that P(A) = 0.5 from the information in statement a. This is because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

Next, we can find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given by P(B|A) = 0.8, based on the witness's ability to correctly identify height 80% of the time.

We also need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given by P(B|not A) = 0.2, based on the witness's ability to err in 20% of the cases.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.888888...

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.89.
