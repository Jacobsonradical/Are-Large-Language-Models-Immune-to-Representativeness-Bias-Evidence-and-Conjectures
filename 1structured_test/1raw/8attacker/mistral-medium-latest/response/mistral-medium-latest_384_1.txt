To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) / [P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) \* P(Shorter)]

We are given:
P(Witness | Taller) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(Witness | Shorter) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(Taller) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15 (the population of attackers 185 cm or taller is 15%)
P(Shorter) = 1 - P(Taller) = 0.85

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.413793103

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
