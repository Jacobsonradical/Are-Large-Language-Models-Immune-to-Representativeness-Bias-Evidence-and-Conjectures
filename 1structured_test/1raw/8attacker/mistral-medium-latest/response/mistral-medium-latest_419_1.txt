To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller." We want to find the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred, denoted as P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(B). From the given information:

1. P(A): The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (population size is roughly equal).
2. P(B|A): The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness is correct 80% of the time).
3. P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:

P(A|B) = [0.4] / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(A|B) = [0.4] / [0.5]

P(A|B) = 0.8

So, given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
