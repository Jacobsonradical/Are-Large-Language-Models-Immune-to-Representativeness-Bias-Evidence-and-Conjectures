To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
E: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We have the following information:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal distribution of heights in the population)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (witness erroneously identifies height 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / (P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H))

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))
P(H|E) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1)
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
