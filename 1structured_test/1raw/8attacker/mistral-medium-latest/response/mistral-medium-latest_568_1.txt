To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers. Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's denote the events:
   A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
   B: Witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

2. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

4. From the information provided, we know that:
   P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
   P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies short people 80% of the time)
   P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 15% of those are attackers)
   P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of those are attackers)

5. However, we still need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies short people 80% of the time, they incorrectly identify short people as 185 cm or taller in the remaining 20% of the cases:
   P(B|¬A) = 0.2

6. Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)] ≈ 0.288
