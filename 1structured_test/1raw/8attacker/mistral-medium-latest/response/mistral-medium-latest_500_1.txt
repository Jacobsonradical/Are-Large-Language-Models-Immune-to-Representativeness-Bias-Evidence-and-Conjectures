To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided. This involves combining the base rates of attackers' heights with the witness's accuracy in identifying heights.

First, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller (information a). This gives us a prior probability for the attacker's height.

Next, we consider the witness's testimony (information b). The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when identifying heights. However, we must also account for the chance that the witness is wrong, which happens 20% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our prior probability with the witness's testimony:

P(H|T) = [P(T|H) \* P(H)] / [P(T|H) \* P(H) + P(T|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:
- H represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- T represents the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- ~H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- ~T represents the witness not testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this isn't provided, but it's implied that the witness would correctly identify a shorter person 80% of the time)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|T) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating this expression gives us an estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

probability: 0.36, or 36%
