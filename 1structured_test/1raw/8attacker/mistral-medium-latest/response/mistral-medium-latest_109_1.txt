To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without any additional information), which is 0.5 based on information "a".
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information "b".
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on information "b".
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (regardless of their actual height).

First, we need to find P(B). Using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
