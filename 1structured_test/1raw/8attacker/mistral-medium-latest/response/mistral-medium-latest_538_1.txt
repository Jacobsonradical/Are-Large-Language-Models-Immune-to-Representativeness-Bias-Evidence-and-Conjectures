To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as E. We want to find the probability P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

We are given that P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

We are also given that P(E|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

To find P(E), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

We are given that P(E|not H) = 0.2, since the witness incorrectly identified the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. We also know that P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

Substituting these values into the formula for P(E), we get:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
