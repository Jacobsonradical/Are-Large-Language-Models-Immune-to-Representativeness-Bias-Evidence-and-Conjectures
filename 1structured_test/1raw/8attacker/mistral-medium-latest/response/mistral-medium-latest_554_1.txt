To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps to find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (evidence B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write the probability as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where:

* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on the information in (a).
* P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5 based on the information in (a).
* P(B|A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the information in (a).
* P(B|¬A) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on the information in (a).

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) = 0.8889 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.889.
