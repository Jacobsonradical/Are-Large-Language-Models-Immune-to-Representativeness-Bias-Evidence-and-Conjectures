To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.

P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information a.

P(W|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we find:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.281 or 28.1%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.281.
