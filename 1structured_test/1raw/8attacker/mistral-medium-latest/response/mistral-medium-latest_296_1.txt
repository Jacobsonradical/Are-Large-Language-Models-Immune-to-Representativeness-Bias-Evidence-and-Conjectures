To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis times the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence is the witness's testimony (E).

Let's denote the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm as P(not H). From the information given in (b), we know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(not H) = 0.85.

Let's denote the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are indeed 185 cm or taller as P(E|H), and the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if they are shorter than 185 cm as P(E|not H). From the information given in (a), we know that P(E|H) = 0.8 and P(E|not H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Substituting the values we have calculated, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
