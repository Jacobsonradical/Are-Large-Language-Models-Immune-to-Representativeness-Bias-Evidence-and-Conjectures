To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

where:

- H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- E is the evidence provided by the witness
- ¬H is the negation of H, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- ¬E is the negation of E, i.e., the witness did not identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we can determine the following probabilities:

- P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
- P(¬H) = 0.5, for the same reason.
- P(E|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time.
- P(E|¬H) = 0.2, since the witness erred in identifying height 20% of the time and the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
= [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
= 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
= 0.8 / 0.9
≈ 0.8889

However, this probability does not take into account the information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. To incorporate this information, we need to revise our estimate of P(H):

- P(H) = 0.15, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Now we can recalculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
= [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4138.
