To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller)

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also know that:
P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

But we need to find P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) and P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We can calculate P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) using the law of total probability:

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) + P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.2 \* 0.5) + (0.8 \* 0.5) = 0.6

Now that we have all the necessary probabilities, we can calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller):

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.833

However, this calculation does not take into account the information in point (b) that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. To incorporate this information, we need to update our prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Using this updated prior probability, we can calculate the revised posterior probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.6 ≈ 0.2

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the information about the population of attackers, is approximately 0.2.
