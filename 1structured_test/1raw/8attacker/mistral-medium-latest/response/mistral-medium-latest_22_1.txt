To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

First, let's find P(H). From the information given in "a", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore:

P(H) = 0.5

Next, let's find P(W|H). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information given in "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore:

P(W|H) = 0.8

Now, we need to find P(W). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can find this probability using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Where ~H denotes the complement of H, i.e., the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From the information given in "b", we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when judging height. Therefore:

P(W|~H) = 0.2

Since P(H) = 0.5 and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5, we have:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is 0.8.
