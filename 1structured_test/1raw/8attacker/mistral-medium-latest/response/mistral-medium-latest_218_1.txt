To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

First, we need to find P(A), which is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.80.

We also need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|¬A) = 0.20.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values we found:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(A|B) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.096 / 0.266

P(A|B) ≈ 0.3609

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3609.

{probability: 0.3609}
