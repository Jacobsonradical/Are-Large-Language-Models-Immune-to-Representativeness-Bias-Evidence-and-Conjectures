To find the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.5 (from a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from b)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from b)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (from a)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
