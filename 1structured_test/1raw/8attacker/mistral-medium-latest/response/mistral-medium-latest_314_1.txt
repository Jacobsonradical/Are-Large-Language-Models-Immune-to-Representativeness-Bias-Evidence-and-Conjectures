To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From piece of information (a), we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(W|H) = 1 (since if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

From piece of information (b), we know that:

* P(W|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that:

* P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

Plugging in the values, we get:

* P(W) = 1 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 1 \* 0.5 / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.833

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.833.
