To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the provided information:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)
4. P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
