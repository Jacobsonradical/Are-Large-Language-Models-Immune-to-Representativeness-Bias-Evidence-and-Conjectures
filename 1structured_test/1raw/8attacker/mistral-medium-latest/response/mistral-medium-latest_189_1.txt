To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without any witness information)
P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know:
P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 \* 0.5)] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = [0.4] / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:
