To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- E: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information provided:

- P(H): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, P(H) = 0.5
- P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
- P(E|H): The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller is 0.8
- P(E|¬H): The witness errs in 20% of the cases, so the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller is 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1] = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
