To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = [P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness said so)

We are given:

P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from a)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.5 (from b)

However, we still need P(Witness said so), which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(Witness said so) = P(Witness said so | Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm) + P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given that P(Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.5 (from b) and P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from a). We also know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases where the person is shorter than 185 cm (from a), so:

P(Witness said so | Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(Witness said so):

P(Witness said so) = 0.2 \* 0.5 + 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability is 0.8.
