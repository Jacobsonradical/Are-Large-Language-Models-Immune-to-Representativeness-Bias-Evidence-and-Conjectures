To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of attackers.

First, let's determine the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability of a correct identification is 0.8.

Next, let's consider the population distribution of attackers. According to the information, 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To find the posterior probability (i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony), we can use Bayes' theorem:

posterior = (likelihood \* prior) / evidence

The likelihood is the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time). The prior is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15. The evidence is the probability of the witness's testimony, which can be calculated as follows:

evidence = (likelihood \* prior) + ((1 - likelihood) \* (1 - prior))

Plugging in the values, we get:

evidence = (0.8 \* 0.15) + ((1 - 0.8) \* (1 - 0.15))
evidence = 0.12 + 0.12
evidence = 0.24

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

posterior = (likelihood \* prior) / evidence
posterior = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24
posterior = 0.4583

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4583 or 45.83%.
