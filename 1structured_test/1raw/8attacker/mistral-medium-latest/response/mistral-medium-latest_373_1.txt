To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A|B) = 0.85/1.85 ≈ 0.459 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and we need to adjust for the fact that the witness is more likely to identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
= (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5 \* 1.85)]
≈ 0.684

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.684.
