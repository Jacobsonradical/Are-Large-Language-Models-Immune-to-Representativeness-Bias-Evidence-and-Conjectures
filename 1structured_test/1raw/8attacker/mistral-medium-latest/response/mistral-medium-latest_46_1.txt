To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.

P(B|A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.

P(B|¬A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information b.

P(¬A) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.5 according to information a.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9

P(A|B) ≈ 0.889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.889.
