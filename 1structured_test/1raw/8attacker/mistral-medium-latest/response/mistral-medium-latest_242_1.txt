To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

First, let's find the prior probability of event A, P(A). From information (a), we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) ≈ 0.15 / 1 ≈ 0.15.

Next, let's find the conditional probability of event B given event A, P(B|A). From information (b), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the conditional probability of event B given the complement of event A, P(B|¬A). From information (b), we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of event A given event B, P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in our values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
