To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as H and the witness testimony as W.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H). From the information given, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Also, 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(W|H). The witness correctly identified a person's height 80% of the time. So:

P(W|H) = 0.80

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, denoted as P(W|¬H). The witness erred in height judgment 20% of the time, so they would incorrectly identify a short person as tall with a probability of 0.20.

P(W|¬H) = 0.20

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Since P(¬H) = 1 - P(H), we have:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4255

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.4255.
