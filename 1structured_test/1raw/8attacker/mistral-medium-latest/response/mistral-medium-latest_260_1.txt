To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we'll denote as H), and the evidence is the witness's testimony (which we'll denote as E).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of the hypothesis, P(H), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller before considering any evidence. From the first piece of information, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, we also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of the hypothesis is P(H) = 0.15.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is P(E|H) = 0.8.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis, P(H|E), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where ~H denotes the negation of the hypothesis (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We already calculated P(H) and P(E|H), so we need to calculate P(E|~H) and P(~H).

The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm, P(E|~H), is 0.2, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases. The prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, P(~H), is 0.85, since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.4286}.
