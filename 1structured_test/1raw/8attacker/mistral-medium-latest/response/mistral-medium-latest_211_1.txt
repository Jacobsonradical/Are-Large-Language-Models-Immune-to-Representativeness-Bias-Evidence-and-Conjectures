To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:

* H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller
* P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
* P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller
* P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we can see that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(not H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and there are twice as many people shorter than 185 cm than those 185 cm or taller in the general population)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) = 0.8888...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.89.
