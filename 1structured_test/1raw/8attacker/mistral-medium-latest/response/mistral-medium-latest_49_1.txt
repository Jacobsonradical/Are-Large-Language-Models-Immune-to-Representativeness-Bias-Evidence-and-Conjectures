To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, we are given:
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
