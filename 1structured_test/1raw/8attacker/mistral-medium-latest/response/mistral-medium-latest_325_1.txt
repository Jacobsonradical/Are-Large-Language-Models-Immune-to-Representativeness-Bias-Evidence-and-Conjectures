To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the information given, we can determine the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

However, we also need to take into account the information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probabilities of H and not H should be adjusted to reflect this fact. Let's call these revised prior probabilities P'(H) and P'(not H).

P'(H) = 0.15
P'(not H) = 1 - P'(H) = 0.85

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P'(H) / [P(E|H) \* P'(H) + P(E|not H) \* P'(not H)]
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
= 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (rounded to two decimal places).
