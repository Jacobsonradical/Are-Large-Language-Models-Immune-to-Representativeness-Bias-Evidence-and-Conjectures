To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the information provided by the witness and the attacker distribution in the population. We can use Bayes' theorem for this estimation.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / P(W)

From the information provided:

P(A) = 0.5, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

P(W|A) = 0.8, as the witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time when they were 185 cm or taller.

P(W|A') = 0.2, as the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm. Since we want to find P(W), we need to consider the witness's identification in both cases:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')

Since the population is roughly equal in size, P(A') = 0.5. Therefore,

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 â‰ˆ 0.667

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.667.
