To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H | W). Bayes' theorem states:

P(H | W) = P(W | H) \* P(H) / [P(W | H) \* P(H) + P(W | not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information given, we can determine the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W | H) = 1.0 (since the witness always correctly identifies heights of people 185 cm or taller)
P(W | not H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(H | W):

P(H | W) = (1.0 \* 0.5) / [(1.0 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.833

{probability: 0.833}
