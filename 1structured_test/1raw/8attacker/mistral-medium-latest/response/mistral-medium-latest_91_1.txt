To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on information 'a'.
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information 'b'.
P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on information 'b'.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))
P(A|B) = 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.1) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is 0.8.
