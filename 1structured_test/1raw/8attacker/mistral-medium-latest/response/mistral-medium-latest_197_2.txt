To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). Based on the information given, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(B|A). Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies their height 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not. The witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since 100% - 15% = 85% of the attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the witness makes an error in 20% \* 85% = 0.17 of the cases where the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. So, P(B|¬A) = 0.17.

Finally, we need to find the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height, which is P(B). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have:

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 = 0.37

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.37 ≈ 0.3243

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is approximately 0.3243.
