To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to find the prior probability (P(H)), the likelihood (P(E|H)), and the marginal probability (P(E)).

P(H) represents the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided:
a) The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.
b) 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker distribution is different than the general population distribution, we'll use the given attacker distribution:
P(H) = 0.15

P(E|H) represents the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
P(E|H) = 0.80

P(E) represents the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We need to find this value to apply Bayes' theorem:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

We know P(H) and P(E|H). We need to find P(E|~H) and P(~H).

P(~H) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller, the remaining attackers are shorter:
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(E|~H) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The witness errs in 20% of the cases:
P(E|~H) = 0.20

Now, we can calculate P(E):
P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find the posterior probability P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) ≈ 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.23 ≈ 0.52

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52.
