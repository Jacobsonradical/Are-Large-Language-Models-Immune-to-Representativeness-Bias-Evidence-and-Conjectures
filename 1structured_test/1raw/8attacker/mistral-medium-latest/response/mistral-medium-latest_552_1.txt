To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a method for calculating conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to know the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to calculate P(A|B), which is the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following information:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not A) = 0.5

We are also given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than the population proportion. We need to take this into account when calculating P(B).

Let's denote the event that the attacker is under 185 cm as C. Then:

P(B|C) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(C) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|C) \* P(C)

Substituting the values we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
    = 0.4 + 0.17
    = 0.57

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
       = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.57
       â‰ˆ 0.6982

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.6982.
