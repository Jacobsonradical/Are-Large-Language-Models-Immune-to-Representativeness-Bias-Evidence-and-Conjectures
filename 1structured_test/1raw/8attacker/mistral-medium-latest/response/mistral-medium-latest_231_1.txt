To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are:

1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A)
2. The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (event B)

We want to find the probability of event A given that event B has occurred, i.e., P(A|B). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can occur in two cases:

1. The attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies them as such (P(B|A) \* P(A)).
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)).

From the given information:

- P(¬A) = 0.5 (population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
