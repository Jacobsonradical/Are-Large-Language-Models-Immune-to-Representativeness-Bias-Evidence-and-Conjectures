To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a) and (b). Here's the reasoning:

1. From (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller, and incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
2. From (b), we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, while only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. This means that the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm)

We know P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 and P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8. To find P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm), we can use the law of total probability:

P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) × P(Height < 185 cm) + P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm)

We know P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.85, P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8, and P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2. Plugging these values in, we get:

P(Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = (0.2 × 0.85) + (0.8 × 0.15) = 0.32

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness says Height ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.32 ≈ 0.375

{probability: 0.375}
