To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15%)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (80% if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 20% otherwise)
P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

We are given P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, and P(B|not A) = 0.2. We can calculate P(not A) as 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.3375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.3375.
