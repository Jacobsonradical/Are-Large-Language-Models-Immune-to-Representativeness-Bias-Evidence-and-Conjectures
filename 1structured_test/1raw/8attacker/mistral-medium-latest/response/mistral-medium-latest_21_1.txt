{probability: 0.56}

Explanation:

First, we need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony and the prior information about the distribution of attackers' heights.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Where:
H = "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
W = "witness testified that the attacker is 185 cm or taller"

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.5 (due to equal population size)
P(¬H) = 0.5 (since H and ¬H are complementary events)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.56

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.
