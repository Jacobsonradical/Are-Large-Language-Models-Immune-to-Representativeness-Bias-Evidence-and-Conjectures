To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(Attacker >= 185 cm)), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker >= 185 cm | Witness says >= 185 cm) = [P(Witness says >= 185 cm | Attacker >= 185 cm) \* P(Attacker >= 185 cm)] / P(Witness says >= 185 cm)

From the given information, we have:

P(Witness says >= 185 cm | Attacker >= 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)

P(Attacker >= 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness says >= 185 cm) = P(Witness says >= 185 cm | Attacker >= 185 cm) \* P(Attacker >= 185 cm) + P(Witness says >= 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) \* P(Attacker < 185 cm)

P(Witness says >= 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(Witness says >= 185 cm):

P(Witness says >= 185 cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255

Now, we can calculate P(Attacker >= 185 cm | Witness says >= 185 cm):

P(Attacker >= 185 cm | Witness says >= 185 cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.467.
