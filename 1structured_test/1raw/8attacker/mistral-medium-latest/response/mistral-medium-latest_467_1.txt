To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller". We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.5 (from information a: the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 1.0 (the witness always correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from information b: the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (from information a: the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

Now we will find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = 1.0 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [1.0 \* 0.5] / 0.6 ≈ 0.833

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.833.
