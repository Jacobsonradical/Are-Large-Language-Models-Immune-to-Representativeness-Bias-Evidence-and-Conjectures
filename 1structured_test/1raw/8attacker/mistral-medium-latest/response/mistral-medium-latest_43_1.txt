To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know:

* P(H): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(H) = 0.5
* P(W|H): The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller. So, P(W|H) = 0.8

Now, we need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can find this using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Where H' is the complementary event of H (the attacker being shorter than 185 cm). We know that:

* P(H') = 0.5
* P(W|H'): The witness errs in identifying a person's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm. However, since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, this means they made an error. So, P(W|H') = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8 or 80%.
