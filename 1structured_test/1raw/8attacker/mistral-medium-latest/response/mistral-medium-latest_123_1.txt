To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

where:

* P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the evidence (E) provided by the witness.
* P(E|H) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
* P(E) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

* P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

To find P(E), we need to calculate P(E|not H), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From the information given, we have:

* P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying a short person as tall 20% of the time)

Using this information, we can calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, the information given in (b) suggests that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller should be lower than 0.5, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we need to adjust our prior probability to reflect this information.

Let's call the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller P(H)', and the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm P(not H)'. From the information given, we have:

* P(H)' = 0.15
* P(not H)' = 0.85

Using this information, we can calculate the updated value of P(E) as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H)' \* P(H)' + P(E|not H)' \* P(not H)'

We already know that P(E|H)' = 0.8 and P(E|not H)' = 0.2. Therefore:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.32

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the evidence:

P(H|E)' = [P(E|H)' \* P(H)'] / P(E)

P(H|E)' = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.32 = 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
