To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we know that P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

Next, we are given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8 when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / ((0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5))

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8.
