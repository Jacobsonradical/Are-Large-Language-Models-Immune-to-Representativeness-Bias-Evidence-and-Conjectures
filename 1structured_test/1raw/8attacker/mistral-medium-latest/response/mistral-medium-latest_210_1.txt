To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (evidence B).

We are given the following information:

1. P(A) = probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).
2. P(B|A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
3. P(B|¬A) = probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (evidence B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.

The answer format requested is: {probability: 0.8889}
