To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we have:

P(H) = 0.5 (Equally distributed population)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (Witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(∼H) = 0.5
P(W|∼H) = 0.2 (Witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we need to find P(W). Using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|∼H) \* P(∼H)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5
= 0.4 + 0.1
= 0.5

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
= 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
