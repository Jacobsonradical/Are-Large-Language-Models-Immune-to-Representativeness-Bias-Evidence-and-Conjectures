To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E denote the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|E).

First, note that from the information given, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
