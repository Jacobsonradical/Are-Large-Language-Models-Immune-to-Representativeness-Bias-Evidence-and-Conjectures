{probability: 0.252, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller (P(Correct|Taller)). This is given as 80%.
2. Next, we need to find the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (P(Incorrect|Shorter)). This is given as 20%.
3. We're told that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(Taller)) is 0.5.
4. However, we're also told that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the actual probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is P'(Taller) = 0.15, and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is P'(Shorter) = 0.85.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:
P(Taller|Correct) = [P(Correct|Taller) \* P'(Taller)] / [P(Correct|Taller) \* P'(Taller) + P(Incorrect|Shorter) \* P'(Shorter)]
6. Plugging in the values, we get:
P(Taller|Correct) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.252

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 0.252.
