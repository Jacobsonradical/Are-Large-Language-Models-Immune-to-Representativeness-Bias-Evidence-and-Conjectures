To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided, we have:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
* P(~H) = 0.5 (half of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we also have information about the proportion of attackers that are tall:

* P(H|Attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

Since we are interested in the probability given that the attack has occurred, we should update our prior probability P(H) using this information. To do this, we can use the principle of total probability:

P(H) = P(H|Attacker) \* P(Attacker) + P(H|~Attacker) \* P(~Attacker)

Assuming that being tall or short does not affect the probability of being an attacker, we have:

* P(Attacker) = P(~Attacker) = 0.5

Therefore:

P(H) = 0.15 \* 0.5 + P(H|~Attacker) \* 0.5

Since we want to update our prior probability P(H) using the information about attackers, we can solve for P(H|~Attacker) and plug it back into the equation:

P(H|~Attacker) = (P(H) - 0.15 \* 0.5) / 0.5
= (0.5 - 0.075) / 0.5
= 0.425

Plugging this back into the equation, we get:

P(H) = 0.15 \* 0.5 + 0.425 \* 0.5
= 0.2625

Now we can plug all these probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.2625) / [(0.8 \* 0.2625) + (0.2 \* 0.7375)]
= 0.3806 / [0.3806 + 0.1475]
= 0.3806 / 0.5281
= 0.7205

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.7205 or 72.05%.
