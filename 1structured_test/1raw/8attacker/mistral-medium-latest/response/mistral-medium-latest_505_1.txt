To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find the probability P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [ P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) ]

Where:
P(B|A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(¬B|¬A) is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
P(¬A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(¬B|¬A) = 0.8
P(A) = P(¬A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.7059

However, we should also consider the information about the distribution of attackers. Since 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller, we should update our prior probability of P(A):

P(A) = 0.15
P(¬A) = 0.85

Now, let's recalculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3182

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification and the distribution of attackers, is approximately 0.3182.
