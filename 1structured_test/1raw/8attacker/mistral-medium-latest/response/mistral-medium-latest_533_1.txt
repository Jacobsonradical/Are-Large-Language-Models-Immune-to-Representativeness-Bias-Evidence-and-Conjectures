To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on information a.
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information b.
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on information b.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
