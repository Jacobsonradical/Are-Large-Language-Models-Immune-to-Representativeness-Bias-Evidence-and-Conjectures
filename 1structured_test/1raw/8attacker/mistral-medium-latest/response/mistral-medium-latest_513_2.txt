To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without any witness information), and
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)

P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller)

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8333

However, we need to take into account the fact that 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller (information "a"). Let's denote:

P'(A) as the actual probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and
P'(¬A) as the actual probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:

P'(¬A) = 0.85
P'(A) = 0.15

Now we can recalculate the probability using the updated information:

P'(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P'(A) / [P(B|A) \* P'(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P'(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P'(A|B) = (1 \* 0.15) / [(1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.385

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.385.
