Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given in (a), we know that:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

From the information given in (a) and (b), we can calculate P(B|¬A) as follows:
P(B|¬A) = P(B|¬A and Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm | ¬A) + P(B|¬A and Attacker is ≥185 cm) \* P(Attacker is ≥185 cm | ¬A)

Since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, we know that:
P(Attacker is <185 cm | ¬A) = 1 (since ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Attacker is ≥185 cm | ¬A) = 0

So, P(B|¬A) = P(B|¬A and Attacker is <185 cm) \* 1

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we have:
P(B|¬A and Attacker is <185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

This simplifies to:
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.8 / 0.9, which is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%}
