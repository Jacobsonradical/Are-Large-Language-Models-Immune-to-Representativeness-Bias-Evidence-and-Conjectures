To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (event B).

From the information given, we know the following:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. We know that:

* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.85 / 1 = 0.85

So we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.09 / 0.29 = 0.31

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller is 0.31.
