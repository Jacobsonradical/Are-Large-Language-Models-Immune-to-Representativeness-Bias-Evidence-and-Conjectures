To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information:

P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculate the above expression:

P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(A|B) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}
