To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probability. In this case, the probability we want to find is P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height (H) is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement (W).

Here's how we can calculate it:

1. P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal, the prior probability is 0.5.
2. P(W|H): Likelihood of the witness's statement given the attacker's height. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(W|H) = 0.8.
3. P(H|W): The probability we want to find.
4. P(W): Probability of the witness's statement. We need to find this probability considering both possibilities for the attacker's height.
   - P(W and H): Probability of the witness's statement and the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the product of their individual probabilities: P(W and H) = P(W|H) \* P(H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4.
   - P(W and not H): Probability of the witness's statement and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. This is the product of the witness making an error (0.2) and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85): P(W and not H) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.
   - P(W): Probability of the witness's statement. This is the sum of the probabilities of the witness's statement and the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness's statement and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and not H) = 0.4 + 0.17 = 0.57.

Now we can calculate P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W and H) / P(W) = 0.4 / 0.57 â‰ˆ 0.698

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.698.
