To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(S) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(~S) = Probability that the witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information given:

P(T) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(S|T) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(S|~T) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(~T) = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(T|S), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(T|S) = P(S|T) \* P(T) / [P(S|T) \* P(T) + P(S|~T) \* P(~T)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|S) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889 or 88.9%.
