To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us find the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (the witness's testimony).

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

We have the following probabilities:

1. P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal, P(A) = 0.5.
2. P(B|A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's accuracy rate, P(B|A) = 0.8.
3. P(B|¬A): The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.
4. P(¬A): The prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is roughly equal, P(¬A) = 0.5.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the expression:

P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1] = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
