To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (from information b, the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 0.5 (complementary probability)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information a, the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is not 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(Attacker in H) = 0.15 (from information b, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker in ¬H) = 0.85 (from information b, 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

First, let's find the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We need to find P(W). Since W can happen either when the attacker is in H and the witness correctly identifies the height, or when the attacker is in ¬H and the witness incorrectly identifies the height, we can write:

P(W) = P(W and H) + P(W and ¬H)

Since the events H and ¬H are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, we can rewrite P(W and H) and P(W and ¬H) as follows:

P(W and H) = P(W|H) \* P(H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.06
P(W and ¬H) = P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.085

So, P(W) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Now, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5 \* 0.15) / 0.145 ≈ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
