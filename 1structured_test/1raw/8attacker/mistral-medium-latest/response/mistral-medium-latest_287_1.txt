To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's define some events and probabilities:

* H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
* ~H: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* W: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* ~W: The witness identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(~H) = 0.5
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(~W|H) = 0.2
* P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* P(~W|~H) = 0.8

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889 or 88.9%.
