To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(Tall). According to information (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(Tall) = 0.15.

Next, let's denote the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height as P(Correct|Tall) if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(Incorrect|Short) if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to information (a), the witness has an 80% accuracy rate for identifying tall individuals and a 20% error rate, so P(Correct|Tall) = 0.8 and P(Incorrect|Short) = 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Tall|Correct) = [P(Correct|Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(Correct|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Correct|Short) \* P(Short)]

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(Short) = 1 - P(Tall) = 0.85.

Also, since the witness is equally likely to encounter a short or tall person, P(Correct|Short) = 1 - P(Incorrect|Short) = 0.8.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Tall|Correct) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.8 \* 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.16

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.16.
