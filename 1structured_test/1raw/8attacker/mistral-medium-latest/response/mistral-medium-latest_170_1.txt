To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the information provided:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (half of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W|H') and P(H'), where H' represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W|H') = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(H') = 0.5 (half of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 0.5 = 1.6

However, this result exceeds 1, which is not possible for a probability. This suggests that the information provided might be inconsistent, especially the statement that "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller."

If we assume that the general population distribution (50% shorter and 50% 185 cm or taller) also applies to attackers, we can recalculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and assuming equal distribution among attackers, is 0.8.

{probability: 0.8}

However, please note that the given information in the problem might be inconsistent, and the calculated probability should be interpreted with caution.
