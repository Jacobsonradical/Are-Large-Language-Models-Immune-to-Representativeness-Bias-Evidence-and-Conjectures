To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's identification of the attacker as being 185 cm or taller as B.

First, let's find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller before considering any evidence. From information (b), we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information (a), we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.80.

We also need to find the likelihood P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From information (a), we know that the witness errs in identifying the height of a person 20% of the time when they are not 185 cm or taller, so P(B|¬A) = 0.20.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.33

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.33.

The answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.33}
