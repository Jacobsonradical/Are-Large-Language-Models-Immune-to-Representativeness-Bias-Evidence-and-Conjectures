To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to take into account both pieces of information (a) and (b).

First, let's consider the base rates provided in (a): 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability of 0.15 for an attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Next, let's consider the witness testimony in (b). The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Height ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Height ≥ 185 cm) / P(Witness testimony)

We know that P(Witness testimony | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time), and we have already established P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15. To find P(Witness testimony), we need to consider both possible heights and their associated probabilities:

P(Witness testimony) = P(Witness testimony | Height < 185 cm) \* P(Height < 185 cm) + P(Witness testimony | Height ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Height ≥ 185 cm)

Since P(Height < 185 cm) = 1 - P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.85, and the witness errs in identifying tall people 20% of the time when they are actually short (P(Witness testimony | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2), we can calculate P(Witness testimony):

P(Witness testimony) = 0.2 \* 0.85 + 0.8 \* 0.15 ≈ 0.255

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness testimony) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.255 ≈ 0.467

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.467.
