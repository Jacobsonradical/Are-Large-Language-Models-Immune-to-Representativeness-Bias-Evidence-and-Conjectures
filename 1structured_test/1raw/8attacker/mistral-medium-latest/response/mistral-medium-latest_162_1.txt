To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information:

a) Prior probability: P(A) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.5 (as per the first statement)
P(B) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5

b) Witness accuracy: P(W|A) = probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(W|B) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|B) \* P(B)]

In this case:
P(A|W) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2)
P(A|W) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|W) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.
