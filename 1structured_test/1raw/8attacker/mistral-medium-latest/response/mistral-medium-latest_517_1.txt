{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We start with a prior belief that the attacker is equally likely to be shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller, based on information "a" (50% chance for each).
2. The witness then provides testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, the witness is not always accurate.
3. To incorporate the witness's testimony, we use Bayes' theorem. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and P(B) be the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
4. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B).
6. From information "b", we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller).
7. We also know that P(A) = 0.5 (from the prior belief in step 1).
8. To find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies any attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is actually shorter or taller than 185 cm. P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A).
9. P(not A) = 0.5 (the prior belief that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
10. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying an attacker's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm).
11. So, P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5.
12. Now we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.56.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.56.
