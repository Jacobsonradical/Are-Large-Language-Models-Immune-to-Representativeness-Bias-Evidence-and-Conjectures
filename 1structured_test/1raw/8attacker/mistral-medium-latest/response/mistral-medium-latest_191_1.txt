To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')]

Here, H' denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (roughly equal population size for those shorter than and 185 cm or taller)
P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

However, the witness's error rate when judging people shorter than 185 cm is not provided directly. We can find it using the given information about the distribution of attackers. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and the witness errs in 20% of the cases, we have:

P(W|H') = 0.2 \* (85/100) = 0.17 (witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.17 \* 0.5)] â‰ˆ 0.8235

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8235.

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.8235}
