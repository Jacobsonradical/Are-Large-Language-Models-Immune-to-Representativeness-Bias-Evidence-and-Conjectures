To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following information:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness errs in identifying height 20% of the time)
* P(A') = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

Since P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A'), we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.145 = 0.06 / 0.145 â‰ˆ 0.414

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer is {probability: 0.414}.
