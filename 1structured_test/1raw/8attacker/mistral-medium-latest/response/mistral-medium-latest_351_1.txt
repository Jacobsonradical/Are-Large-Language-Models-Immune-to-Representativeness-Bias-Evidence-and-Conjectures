To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(A) and the probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker's height as P(C|A) or P(C|¬A) depending on whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller or not.

From information (a), we know that:
P(C|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(C|¬A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

From information (b), we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / [P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|C) ≈ 0.3636

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3636.
