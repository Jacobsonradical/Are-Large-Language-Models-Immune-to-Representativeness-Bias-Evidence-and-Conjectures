To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (let's call this event A) given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (let's call this event B).

Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find the prior probabilities:

P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the information in a. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075.

P(¬A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm based on the information in a. Since only 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425.

Now, let's find the likelihoods:

P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information in b, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to the information in b, the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Next, let's find the probability of the evidence:

P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values we calculated earlier:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.12

Finally, we can find the probability we are looking for using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.12 ≈ 0.467

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information is approximately 0.467.
