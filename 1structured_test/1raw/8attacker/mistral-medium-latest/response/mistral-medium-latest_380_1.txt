To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b). Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the witness's accuracy (information a). The witness can correctly identify a person's height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller and has a 20% error rate.
2. Next, let's consider the population distribution and the attacker distribution (information b). The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller. However, among attackers, 85% are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. We can use Bayes' theorem to combine this information and estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:
P(H) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(~H) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W|H) = probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are
P(W|~H) = probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (15% of the population are attackers who are 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (85% of the population are attackers who are shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.153 / (0.153 + 0.085)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.153 / 0.238
P(H|W) ≈ 0.643

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.643.

The answer format you provided is: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Therefore, the final answer is: {probability: 0.643}
