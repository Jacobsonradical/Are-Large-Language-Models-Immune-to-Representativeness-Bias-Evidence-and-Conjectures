To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the given information:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

However, we need P(B|not A), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate the probability:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3855

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.3855}
