To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Taller | Witness) = P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) / [ P(Witness | Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness | Shorter) \* P(Shorter) ]

Where:
- P(Taller | Witness) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
- P(Witness | Taller) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 according to information "a".
- P(Taller) is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to information "b", this is 0.15.
- P(Witness | Shorter) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2 according to information "a".
- P(Shorter) is the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to information "b", this is 0.85.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(Taller | Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.20 / (0.20 + 0.17) = 0.20 / 0.37 = 0.54

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.54.
