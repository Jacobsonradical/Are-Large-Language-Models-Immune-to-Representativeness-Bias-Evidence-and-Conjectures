To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From information (a):
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Now, we need to find P(B|A) and P(B|¬A). From information (b):
P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness always identifies correctly when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.833

However, we should also consider the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm (information a). So, even though the witness has high accuracy, it is still less likely for the attacker to be 185 cm or taller given this information.

Let's recalculate P(A) and P(¬A) considering the attacker population:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can recalculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.15) / [(1 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.395

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.395.
