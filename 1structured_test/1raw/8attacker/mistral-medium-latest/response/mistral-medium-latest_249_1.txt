To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. We know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2

We also know that:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

So we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.8.
