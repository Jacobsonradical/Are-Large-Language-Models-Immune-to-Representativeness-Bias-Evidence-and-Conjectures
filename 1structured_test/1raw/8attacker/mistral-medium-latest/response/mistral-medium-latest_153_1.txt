To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B).

Given information:
P(A) = probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from statement b)
P(A') = probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = probability of the witness identifying a tall person correctly = 0.80 (from statement a)
P(B|A') = probability of the witness identifying a short person as tall = 0.20 (from statement a)

We need to calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A') = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
