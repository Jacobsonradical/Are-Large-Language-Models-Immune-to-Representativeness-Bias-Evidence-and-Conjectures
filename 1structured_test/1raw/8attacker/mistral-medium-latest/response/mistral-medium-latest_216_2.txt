{probability: 0.28, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We have two pieces of information: Witness accuracy and attacker statistics.
2. First, let's find the probability of the witness being correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since they are correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.
3. Next, let's find the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the actual height distribution of attackers. According to the information, 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness said they are. Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
5. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
6. Using the information from steps 2 and 3, we get: P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (attacker statistics).
7. To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(B|¬A) = 0.2 and P(¬A) = 0.85.
8. Plugging these values into the equation, we get: P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
9. Finally, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.28.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement and the attacker statistics is approximately 0.28.
