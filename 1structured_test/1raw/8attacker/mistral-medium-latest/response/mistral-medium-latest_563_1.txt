To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events A and B. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height of an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
* P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (since half the population is 185 cm or taller and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time). Also, P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.06 + 0.085 = 0.145

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.145 ≈ 0.4069

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (rounded to two decimal places).
