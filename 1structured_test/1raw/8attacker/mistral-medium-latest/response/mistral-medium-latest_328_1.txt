To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

From Bayes' theorem: P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
P(H) = 0.5 (from a)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (from b)

We can calculate P(W) using the law of total probability: P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We are missing P(W|not H). From the information given in b, we know that the witness errs 20% of the time. Since the witness is equally likely to encounter someone shorter or taller than 185 cm, this error rate should apply to the cases when the witness encounters someone shorter than 185 cm. Therefore:

P(W|not H) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So, {probability: 0.8}
