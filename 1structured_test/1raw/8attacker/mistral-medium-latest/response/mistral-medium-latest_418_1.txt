To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also need P(W|¬H) and P(¬H). From the information provided:

P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(¬H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

However, we also have the information that among attackers, only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information should be taken into account when estimating the prior probability P(H). So, let's update P(H) and recalculate:

P(H) = 0.15
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.31

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.31 ≈ 0.3676

So the updated estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the information about the proportion of attackers, is approximately:

{probability: 0.3676}
