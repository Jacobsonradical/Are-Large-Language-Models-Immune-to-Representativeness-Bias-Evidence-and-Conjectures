To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

From the given information, we know:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

We also need to find P(W|¬H) and P(¬H). From the given information:

* P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
* P(¬H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, the given information also mentions that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information should be taken into account when calculating the prior probability P(H). So, let's recalculate P(H) and P(¬H) as follows:

* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can recalculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

And finally, we can find the updated P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
