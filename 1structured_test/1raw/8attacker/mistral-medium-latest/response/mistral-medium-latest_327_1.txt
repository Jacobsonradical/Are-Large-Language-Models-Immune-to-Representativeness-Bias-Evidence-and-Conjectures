To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided:

1. P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (as mentioned in piece of information a).
2. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (as mentioned in piece of information b, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
3. P(B): To find this probability, we need P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A), where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2. And since P(¬A) = 0.85 (from the information in a), we have: P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is around 0.4138.
