To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which we are given as 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size). Let's denote P(E|H) as the likelihood of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we are given as 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time). Finally, let's denote P(H|E) as the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

We are also given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. However, since the witness is more likely to make an error when judging the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm, we need to adjust these probabilities based on the witness's accuracy rate. Specifically, the likelihood of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases, and 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so the probability of both events occurring is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17).

Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

= 0.12 / 0.29

= 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
