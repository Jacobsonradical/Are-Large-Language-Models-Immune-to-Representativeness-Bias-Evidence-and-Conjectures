To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population is roughly equal in size for people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (since the complement of P(A) is the probability of being shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need to consider the information about the distribution of attackers' heights. Specifically, we are given that:

P(Attacker|A) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker|¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

In order to apply Bayes' theorem, we need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.89.
