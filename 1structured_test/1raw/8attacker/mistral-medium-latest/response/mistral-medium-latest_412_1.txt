To find the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information a: P(H) = 0.5 or 50%)
P(~H) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (from information a: P(~H) = 0.5 or 50%)

Let's denote:

P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller (from information b: P(E|H) = 0.8 or 80%)
P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (from information b: P(E|~H) = 0.2 or 20%)

We want to find the probability P(H|E) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
