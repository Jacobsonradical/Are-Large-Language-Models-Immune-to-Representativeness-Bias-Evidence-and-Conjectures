To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(~H) = 0.5
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

First, let's find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)

Plugging in the given values:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, let's find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

Plugging in the given values:

P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5

So, P(H|W) = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
