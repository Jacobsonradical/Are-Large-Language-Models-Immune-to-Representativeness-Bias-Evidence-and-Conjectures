To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony. Let's denote this probability as P(Tall | Witness).

First, let's break down the information provided:

1. P(Tall) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
2. P(Attack | Tall) = 0.15 (15% attackers are 185 cm or taller.)
3. P(Attack | Not Tall) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm.)
4. P(Witness | Tall) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller.)
5. P(Witness | Not Tall) = 0.2 (The witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller.)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Witness) = [P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(Witness | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness | Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Tall | Witness) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(Tall | Witness) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
