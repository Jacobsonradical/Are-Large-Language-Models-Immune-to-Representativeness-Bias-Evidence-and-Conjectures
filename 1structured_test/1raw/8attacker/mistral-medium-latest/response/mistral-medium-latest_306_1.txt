To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.

{probability: 0.8889}
