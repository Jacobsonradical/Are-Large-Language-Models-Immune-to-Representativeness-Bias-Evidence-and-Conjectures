To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events A and B. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller before considering the witness's testimony. According to the information provided in "a", this probability is 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).

Next, we need to find the conditional probability P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided in "b", this probability is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time).

We also need to find the conditional probability P(B|¬A), which is the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided in "b", this probability is 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
