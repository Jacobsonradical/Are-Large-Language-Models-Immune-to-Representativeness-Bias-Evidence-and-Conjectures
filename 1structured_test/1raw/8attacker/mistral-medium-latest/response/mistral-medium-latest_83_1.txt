To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We want to find the posterior probability P(H|W), where H is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and W is the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H). From information a, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, P(H) = 0.5.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(W|H). From information b, we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Since we are conditional on the attacker being 185 cm or taller, this means that the witness will identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(W|H) = 0.8.

We also need to find the likelihood P(W|¬H), where ¬H is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information b, we know that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying a person's height. Since we are conditional on the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, this means that the witness will mistakenly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Substituting the values we found earlier:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the values:

P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
