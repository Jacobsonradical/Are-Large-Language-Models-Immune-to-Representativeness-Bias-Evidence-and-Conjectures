To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of calculating conditional probability.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the given information, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* P(W|H') = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Note that H' denotes the complement of H)

We also need to find P(W), which is the probability of the witness's testimony. Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

Since P(H) = 0.5 and P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.5, we have:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can find P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
= 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5
= 0.8

However, we also need to consider the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information should affect our prior probability P(H) and therefore our estimate of P(H|W).

To incorporate this information, we can adjust our prior probability P(H) using the information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller:

P(H) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15

Now, we can find the updated probability of the witness's testimony:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.28

Finally, we can find the updated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.28
= 0.4286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4286}
