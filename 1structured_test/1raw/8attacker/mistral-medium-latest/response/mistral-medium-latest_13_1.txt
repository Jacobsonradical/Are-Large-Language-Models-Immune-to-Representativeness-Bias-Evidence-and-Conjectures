To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (from a)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(W|H) = 0.8 (from b)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (from b)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
