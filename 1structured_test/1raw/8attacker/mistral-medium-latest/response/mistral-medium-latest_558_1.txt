To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(F) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller
- P(W|F) as the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm

According to the information provided:

- P(T) = 0.5 (equal population size)
- P(F) = 0.5
- P(W|T) = 0.8 (80% correct identification for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|F) = 0.2 (20% incorrect identification for people shorter than 185 cm)

However, we also have information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller and those who are shorter. Let's denote:

- P'(T) as the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P'(F) as the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Then:

- P'(T) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P'(F) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(T|W) = [P'(T) \* P(W|T)] / [P'(T) \* P(W|T) + P'(F) \* P(W|F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2)]

Calculating the result:

P(T|W) â‰ˆ 0.281 or 28.1%

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.281.
