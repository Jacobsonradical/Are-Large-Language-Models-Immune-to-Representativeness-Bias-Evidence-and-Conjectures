To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified them as such (evidence B).

Let's denote the probability of event A as P(A), the probability of event B given event A as P(B|A), and the probability of event B as P(B). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). The witness correctly identified the height of people who were 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15.

Now we need to find P(B). We can do this by using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability of them identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Also, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
