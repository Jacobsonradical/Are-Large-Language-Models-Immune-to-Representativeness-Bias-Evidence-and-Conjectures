To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H=T). From the first piece of information, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, we can assume that P(H=T) = 0.5.

Let's denote the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller as P(W=T|H=T), and the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm as P(W=T|H=F). From the second piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, we can assume that P(W=T|H=T) = 0.8 and P(W=T|H=F) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(H=T|W=T) = [P(W=T|H=T) \* P(H=T)] / [P(W=T|H=T) \* P(H=T) + P(W=T|H=F) \* P(H=F)]

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(H=T|W=T) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H=T|W=T) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H=T|W=T) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H=T|W=T) â‰ˆ 0.89

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.89.

{probability: 0.89}
