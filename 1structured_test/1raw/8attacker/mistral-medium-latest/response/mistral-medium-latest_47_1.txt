To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population.
P(B) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm in the general population.
P(W|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller.
P(W|B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we have:
P(W|A) = 0.8, P(W|B) = 0.2, P(A) = 0.5 and P(B) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5.

However, we also know that among attackers, 85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to update our prior probabilities using this information:

P(Attacker\_A) = 0.15 and P(Attacker\_B) = 0.85.

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Attacker\_A|W) = [P(W|Attacker\_A) \* P(Attacker\_A)] / [P(W|Attacker\_A) \* P(Attacker\_A) + P(W|Attacker\_B) \* P(Attacker\_B)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Attacker\_A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.433

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.433.
