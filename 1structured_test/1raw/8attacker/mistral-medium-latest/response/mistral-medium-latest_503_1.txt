To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H and the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as W.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H). According to the information in (a), the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, so P(H) = 0.5.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood P(W|H). According to the information in (b), the witness correctly identified the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witness's testimony P(W). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

We already know that P(W|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.5. We also know that P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5. We need to find P(W|not H), which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. According to the information in (b), the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W|not H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the above equation, we get:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

Substituting the values we calculated above, we get:

P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
