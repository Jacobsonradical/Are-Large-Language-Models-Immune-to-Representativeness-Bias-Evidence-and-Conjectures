To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is defined as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

In this case:

Event A: The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Event B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We need to find P(A|B). We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

However, we are also given the information that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is different from the general population, and we should take this into account. So, we will modify our probabilities as follows:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.38

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.38.

Answer: {probability: 0.38}
