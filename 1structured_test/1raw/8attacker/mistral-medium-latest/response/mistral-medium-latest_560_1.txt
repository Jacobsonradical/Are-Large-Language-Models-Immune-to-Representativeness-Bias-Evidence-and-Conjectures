To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (a priori probability)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness makes a correct identification when the person is 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness makes an incorrect identification when the person is not 185 cm or taller

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.889.
