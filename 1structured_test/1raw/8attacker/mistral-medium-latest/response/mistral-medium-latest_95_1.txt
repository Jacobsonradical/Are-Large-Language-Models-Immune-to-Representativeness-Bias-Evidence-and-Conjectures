To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time) and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time).

We are also told that P(A) = 0.5 (equal population size of short and tall people) and P(¬A) = 0.5.

However, the information in (b) provides a different distribution for attackers: P(A) = 0.15 and P(¬A) = 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)) ≈ 0.375

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.375.
