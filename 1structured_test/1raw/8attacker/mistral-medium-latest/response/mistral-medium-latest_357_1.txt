To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.5 (due to equal population size)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now, we want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|W) = 0.8

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.
