To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:
H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

From the given information, we have:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Additionally, we are told that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. However, this information is not relevant to the calculation of P(H|E), since it only pertains to the population of attackers and not the general population.

Therefore, we can plug in the values to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) = 0.88888888889 or approximately 0.89

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.89 or 89%.
