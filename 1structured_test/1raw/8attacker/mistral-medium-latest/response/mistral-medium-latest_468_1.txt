To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population size)
P(~H) = 0.5
P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (witness errs 20% of the time on shorter people)
P(H|Attacker) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(~H|Attacker) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't have the probabilities P(Attacker|H) and P(Attacker|~H), which are necessary to apply Bayes' theorem directly. Since the witness's accuracy is not influenced by whether the person is an attacker or not, we can make an assumption that these probabilities are equal:

P(Attacker|H) = P(Attacker|~H) = k

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since P(Attacker|H) = P(Attacker|~H) = k, we have:

P(W|H) \* P(H|Attacker) = 0.8 \* 0.15 \* k
P(W|~H) \* P(~H|Attacker) = 0.2 \* 0.85 \* k

Therefore,

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15 \* k) / [(0.8 \* 0.15 \* k) + (0.2 \* 0.85 \* k)]

Solving for P(H|W):

P(H|W) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
