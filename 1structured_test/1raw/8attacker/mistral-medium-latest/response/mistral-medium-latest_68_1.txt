To find the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

First, let's find the prior probability P(H) and the likelihood P(W|H). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we have:

P(H) = 0.5

Since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.15 (the witness identifies the attacker's height correctly as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's find P(W|¬H), the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, we have:

P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(H) \* P(W|H) / [P(H) \* P(W|H) + P(¬H) \* P(W|¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.5 \* 0.15) / [(0.5 \* 0.15) + (0.5 \* 0.2)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.429

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.429.
