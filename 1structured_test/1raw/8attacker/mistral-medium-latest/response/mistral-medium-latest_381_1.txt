To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller."

We are given the following probabilities:

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 (80%).
2. P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population. This probability is 0.5, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
3. P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.2 (20%).
4. P(¬A): The probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm in the general population. This probability is 0.5, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

However, we also need to consider the information about the distribution of attackers' heights (85% under 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller). So, let's update P(A) and P(¬A) with this information:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that an attacker is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% chance that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the desired probability, P(A|B), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
