To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
E is the evidence provided by the witness

From the information given, we have:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need to adjust P(E|H) and P(E|not H) to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Let's call this new information F.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we can calculate P(E|H and F) and P(E|not H and F):

P(E|H and F) = P(E|H) \* P(F|H) / P(F) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.3929
P(E|not H and F) = P(E|not H) \* P(F|not H) / P(F) = 0.2 \* 0.85 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.3077

Now we can calculate P(H|E and F) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E and F) = P(E|H and F) \* P(H|F) / [P(E|H and F) \* P(H|F) + P(E|not H and F) \* P(not H|F)]

Since P(H|F) and P(not H|F) are the same as P(H) and P(not H), we have:

P(H|E and F) = (0.3929 \* 0.5) / [(0.3929 \* 0.5) + (0.3077 \* 0.5)] = 0.5588

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5588 or 55.88%.
