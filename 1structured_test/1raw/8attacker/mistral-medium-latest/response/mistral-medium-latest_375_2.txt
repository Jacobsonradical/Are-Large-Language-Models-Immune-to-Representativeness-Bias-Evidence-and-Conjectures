To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
3. P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

However, we need to find P(W|not H), the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Since the witness errs in 20% of cases, and we know that the number of people shorter than 185 cm is equal to those who are 185 cm or taller:

4. P(W|not H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8889

However, we must also consider the information about the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (15%) and shorter than 185 cm (85%). This information changes our prior probabilities P(H) and P(not H):

5. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
6. P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now, we can recalculate P(H|W) with the new prior probabilities:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|W) ≈ 0.4138
