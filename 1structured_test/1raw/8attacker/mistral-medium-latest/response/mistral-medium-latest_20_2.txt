To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: Event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From information "a":

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(~H) = 0.5

From information "a" and "b":

P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)

P(W|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we need to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
