To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, we know that P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

Next, we need to find P(W|H) and P(W|¬H), which represent the probabilities of the witness's testimony given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

From the information provided, P(W|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller.

Similarly, P(W|¬H) = 0.2, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888...

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.89.
