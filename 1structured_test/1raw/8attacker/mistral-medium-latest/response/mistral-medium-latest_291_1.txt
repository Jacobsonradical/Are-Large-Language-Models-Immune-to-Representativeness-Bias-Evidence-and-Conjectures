To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony. Then, we want to find P(A|B).

First, let's find the prior probability P(A) using the information in statement a. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 * 0.5 = 0.075

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A) using the information in statement b. Given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.80

Now, let's find the probability of the witness testimony P(B) by applying the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We need to find P(B|¬A), which is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Using the information in statement b, we have:

P(B|¬A) = 0.20

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.075) + (0.20 \* 0.925) ≈ 0.155

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.075) / 0.155 ≈ 0.387

{probability: 0.387}
