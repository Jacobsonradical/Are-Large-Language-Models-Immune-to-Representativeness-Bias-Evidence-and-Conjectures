To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

From the problem statement, we know:

* P(H): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(H) = 0.5
* P(E|H): The witness correctly identified the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(E|H) = 0.8
* P(E|~H): The witness incorrectly identified the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(E|~H) = 0.2

Since we are only considering two possibilities (i.e., the attacker's height is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller), we can use the following relationship:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we should also take into account the information in statement (a) that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This information should modify our prior probability of P(H) being 0.5, which was based on the assumption that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

Therefore, we should update our prior probability as follows:

* P(H): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15

Using this updated prior probability, we can recalculate P(H|E) as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony and the information in statement (a) is 0.24.
