{probability: 0.54}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.
2. Next, we need to consider the information about the distribution of attackers' heights. The victim said that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and only 15% are 185 cm or taller. This means that if the witness is correct, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 15/(15+0.85\*85) = 0.15/(0.15+0.7225) = 0.15/0.8725 ≈ 0.172.
3. However, we also have to account for the fact that the witness might be wrong. If the witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller (which happens 20% of the time), the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller is still only 15%. So the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness is wrong is 0.15.
4. Now we can calculate the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being 185 cm or taller, plus the probability of the witness being wrong and the attacker still being 185 cm or taller: 0.8\*0.172 + 0.2\*0.15 ≈ 0.54.

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.54.
