{probability: 0.56, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Based on the first piece of information (a), we know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
2. The second piece of information (b) tells us that a witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. The witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying a person's height correctly under conditions similar to that night and errs in 20% of the cases.
3. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = [P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)] / [P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is <185 cm) \* P(Attacker is <185 cm)]

4. Plugging in the values from the problem, we get:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56, given the witness's testimony.
