{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Based on information "a", the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%) and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).
2. Given the witness testimony in information "b", we need to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
3. To find the posterior probability, we use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)].
4. Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller. Event B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. P(A) = 0.15 (from step 1)
6. P(B|A) = 0.80 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
7. P(not A) = 0.85 (from step 1)
8. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
9. Applying Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
10. P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.56

Therefore, based on the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.
