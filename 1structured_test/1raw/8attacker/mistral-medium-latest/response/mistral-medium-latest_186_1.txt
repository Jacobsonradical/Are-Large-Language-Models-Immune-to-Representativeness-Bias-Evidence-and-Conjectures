To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method for updating probabilities based on new evidence. Let's denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as "T" and the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as "W".

First, we need to find the prior probability of T, which is the probability of T before considering the witness's testimony. From the information provided in "a", we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can estimate the prior probability of T as:

P(T) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.15) = 0.15 / 0.30 = 0.5

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is denoted as P(W|T). From the information provided in "b", we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can estimate P(W|T) as:

P(W|T) = 0.8

We also need to find the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is denoted as P(W|~T). From the information provided in "b", we know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, we can estimate P(W|~T) as:

P(W|~T) = 0.2

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability of T given W, which is denoted as P(T|W):

P(T|W) = P(W|T) \* P(T) / [P(W|T) \* P(T) + P(W|~T) \* P(~T)]

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

P(T|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8889

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.89 or 89%.
