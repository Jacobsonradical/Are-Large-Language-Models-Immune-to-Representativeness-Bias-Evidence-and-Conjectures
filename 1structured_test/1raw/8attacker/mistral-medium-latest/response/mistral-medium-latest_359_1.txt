To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

From the information given, we can estimate the following probabilities:

* P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can estimate P(H) = 0.5.
* P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we can estimate P(E|H) = 0.8.
* P(E|¬H): the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis. Since the witness erred in 20% of the cases, we can estimate P(E|¬H) = 0.2.
* P(E): the probability of the evidence. Using the law of total probability, we can write: P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
