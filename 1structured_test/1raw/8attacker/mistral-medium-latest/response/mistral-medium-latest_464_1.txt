To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* H: the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / P(W)

We have the following information:

* From point a: P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
* From point a: P(W|H) = 1 (since attackers who are 185 cm or taller will always be identified as such by the witness, as they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
* From point b: P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm)
* From point b: P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 1 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (1 \* 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.833

However, we also need to consider the information from point a that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This prior probability should be combined with the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* A: the event that the attacker is an attacker (as opposed to a non-attacker)
* P'(H) = 0.15 and P'(¬H) = 0.85 (these are the prior probabilities for an attacker)
* P'(W|H) and P'(W|¬H) are the same as P(W|H) and P(W|¬H) respectively, since the witness's ability to judge height is not affected by whether the person is an attacker or not

We want to find the probability P'(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, taking into account the prior probabilities for an attacker.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we can write:

P'(H|W) = [P'(W|H) \* P'(H)] / P'(W)

We have:

* P'(W) = P'(W|H) \* P'(H) + P'(W|¬H) \* P'(¬H) = 1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.23

So:

P'(H|W) = (1 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.652

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the prior probabilities for an attacker, is approximately 0.652.
