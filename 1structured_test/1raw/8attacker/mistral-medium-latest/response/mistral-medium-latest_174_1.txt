To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, this would suggest that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5. However, we also know that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information suggests that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is actually lower than 0.5.

To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W denote the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Then Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

where ¬H denotes the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(¬W|H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to find P(W|¬H), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, and we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that the witness errs equally often for people who are shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:

P(W|¬H) = 0.1 \* 0.2 = 0.02

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.02 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) ≈ 0.173

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the known distribution of attacker heights, is approximately 0.173.
