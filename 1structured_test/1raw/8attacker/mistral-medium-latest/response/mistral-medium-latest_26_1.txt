To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a rule that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of H given W as:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided, we can estimate the following probabilities:

* P(H): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can estimate P(H) to be 0.5.
* P(~H): The probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.
* P(W|H): The probability of the witness correctly identifying an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
* P(W|~H): The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20%.

However, we also need to take into account the information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Thus, we should update our prior probabilities P(H) and P(~H) as follows:

* P(H) = 0.15
* P(~H) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.4286

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.429 or 42.9%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.429}
