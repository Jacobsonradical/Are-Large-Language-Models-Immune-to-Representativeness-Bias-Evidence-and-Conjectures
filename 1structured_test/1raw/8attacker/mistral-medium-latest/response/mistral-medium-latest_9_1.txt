{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. From information "a", we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm tall, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. From information "b", we know that the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem.
4. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
6. Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)], where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
7. We know P(A) = 0.15, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a tall person), and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall).
8. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.56.
9. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.56.
