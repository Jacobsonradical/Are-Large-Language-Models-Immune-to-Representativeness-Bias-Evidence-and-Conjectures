To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, we know from (a) that:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

Also from (a), we know that:
P(B|A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers under 185 cm and 15% attackers 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.15

However, we need to adjust these probabilities based on the witness's accuracy from (b):

P(B|A) \* 0.8 = 0.68 (witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
P(B|¬A) / 0.2 = 0.075 (witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.68 \* 0.5) / [(0.68 \* 0.5) + (0.075 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.897

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.897.
