To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information: the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of attackers.

First, let's calculate the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.

Next, let's consider the population distribution of attackers. We are told that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = [P(Witness says 185+ cm | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm)] / P(Witness says 185+ cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

This simplifies to:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness says 185+ cm) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
