To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

We know the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.5 (from information b, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information a, the witness is 80% accurate in identifying tall people)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (from information a, the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying short people)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]

P(H|W) = 0.4 / 0.5

P(H|W) = 0.8
