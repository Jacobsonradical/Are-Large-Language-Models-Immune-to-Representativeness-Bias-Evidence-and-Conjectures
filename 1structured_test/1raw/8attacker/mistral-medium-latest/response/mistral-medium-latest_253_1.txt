To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in identifying a person's height 20% of the time and incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8 or 80%.
