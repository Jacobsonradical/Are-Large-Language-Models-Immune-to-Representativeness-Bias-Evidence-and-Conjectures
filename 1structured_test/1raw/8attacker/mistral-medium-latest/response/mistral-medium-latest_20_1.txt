{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80%.
2. Next, we need to take into account the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability is 0.15.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such):
   - P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
   - Where A is the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", B is the event "the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller", P(¬A) is the probability of not A (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and P(B|¬A) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm.
4. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(B|¬A) = 0.2.
5. Plugging in the values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
   - P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.56

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.
