To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(H) and P(~H) based on information b. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can say:

P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Next, we need the likelihoods P(W|H) and P(W|~H) based on information a. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller, and erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm:

P(W|H) = 0.80
P(W|~H) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.338

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.338.
