To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attackers' heights. Here's the reasoning:

1. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
2. The witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller.
3. Among attackers, 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness says 185+) = (P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+)) / P(Witness says 185+)

Let's break down the components:

- P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80%).
- P(Attacker is 185+): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(Witness says 185+): The probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(Witness says 185+) = P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is <185) \* P(Attacker is <185) + P(Witness says 185+ | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+)
  = (0.2 \* 0.85) + (0.8 \* 0.15) = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness says 185+) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
