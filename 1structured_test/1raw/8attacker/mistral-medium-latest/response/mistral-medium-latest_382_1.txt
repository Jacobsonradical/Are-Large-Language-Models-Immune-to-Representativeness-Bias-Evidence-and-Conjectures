{probability: 0.56, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's how I arrived at this estimate:

1. First, let's consider the base rates of attackers being shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm and taller, as described in statement a. Since the population is roughly equal in size, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm while 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can represent this as a prior probability:
   - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
   - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
2. Next, let's incorporate the witness's testimony and accuracy rates from statement b. We need to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:
   - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says 185 cm or taller) = [P(Witness says 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness says 185 cm or taller)
4. We know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs in 20% of the cases, so:
   - P(Witness says 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
   - P(Witness says 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness error rate when the person is shorter)
5. We also know that:
   - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
6. To find P(Witness says 185 cm or taller), we can use the law of total probability:
   - P(Witness says 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness says 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - P(Witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.24
7. Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
   - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.56.
