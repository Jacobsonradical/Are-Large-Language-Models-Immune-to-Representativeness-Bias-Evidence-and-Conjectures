To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(E) as the probability of the witness's testimony.
P(H|E) as the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony.

From the information provided, we know:

1. P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
2. P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person's height is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(E|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness erred 20% of the time when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.4 / 0.5
P(H|E) = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

The answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.8}
