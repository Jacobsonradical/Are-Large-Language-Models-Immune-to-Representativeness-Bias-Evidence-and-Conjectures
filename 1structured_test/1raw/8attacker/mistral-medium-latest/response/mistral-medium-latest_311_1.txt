To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Define the events:
   A = the attacker is 185 cm or taller
   B = the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
2. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
3. Calculate the likelihoods:
   P(B|A) = 1.0 (since the witness always correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller)
   P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm)
4. Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
             = 1.0 \* 0.5 / [1.0 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
             = 0.8333

However, we also have the information that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we should update the prior probability P(A) using this information:

5. Update the prior probability:
   P(A) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
6. Recalculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
             = 1.0 \* 0.15 / [1.0 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
             = 0.3902

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information is approximately 0.3902.
