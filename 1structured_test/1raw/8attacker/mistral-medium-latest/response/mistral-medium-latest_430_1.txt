To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), which is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information given, we know that:

* P(W|H) = 0.8, which is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
* P(H) = 0.5, which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).

However, we don't know P(W) directly. We can find P(W) by using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H') \* P(H')

where H' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:

* P(W|H') = 0.2, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.
* P(H') = 0.5, which is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can find P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8 or 80%.
