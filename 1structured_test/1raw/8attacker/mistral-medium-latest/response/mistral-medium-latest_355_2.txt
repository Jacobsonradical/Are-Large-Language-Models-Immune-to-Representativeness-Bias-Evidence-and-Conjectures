To find the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find the prior probabilities P(A) and P(¬A), where ¬A denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Thus:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A) and P(B|¬A). P(B|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's accuracy rate, this is 80%.
P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the witness's error rate, this is 20%.

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability of the witness's testimony. Since we know P(B|A), P(B|¬A), P(A), and P(¬A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find the estimated probability P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.478261
