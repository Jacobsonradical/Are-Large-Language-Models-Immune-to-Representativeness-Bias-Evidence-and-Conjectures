To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (let's call this event H), and the new evidence is that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller (let's call this event E).

The probability we want to calculate is P(H|E), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

Let's calculate each term on the right-hand side:

1. P(H): This is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to information (a), this probability is 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
2. P(E|H): This is the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. According to information (b), the witness correctly identifies the height of people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.8.
3. P(E): This is the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. To calculate this, we'll use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), we know that P(¬H) = 0.5. From information (b), we know that the witness incorrectly identifies the height of people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Therefore, P(E|¬H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now that we have all the terms, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) \* P(H)) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.8.
