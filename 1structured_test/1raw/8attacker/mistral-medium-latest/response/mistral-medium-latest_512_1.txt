To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the information provided in a, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(not A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

From the information provided in b, we know that:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 1
P(A|B) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that a witness identified them as such is 0.8.
