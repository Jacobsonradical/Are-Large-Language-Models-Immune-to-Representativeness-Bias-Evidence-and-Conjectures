To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is equal to the product of the prior probability of that event and the likelihood of the observed data given that event, divided by the sum of the products of the prior probabilities of all possible events and their corresponding likelihoods.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are as P(W|H). We are given that P(W|H) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. We are also given that P(H) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

We can use the information in statement b to determine the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(A|H). We are given that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A|H) = 0.15.

Now we need to determine the likelihood of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not actually 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(W|¬H). We are given that the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, so P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H) \* P(A|H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) \* P(A|H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) \* P(A|¬H)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|W) = [0.8 \* 0.5 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.5 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.5 \* 0.85]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(H|W) ≈ 0.214

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.214.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.214}
