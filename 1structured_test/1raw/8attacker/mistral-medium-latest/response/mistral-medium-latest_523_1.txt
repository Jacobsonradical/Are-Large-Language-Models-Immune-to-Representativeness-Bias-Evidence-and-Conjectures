To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's find the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:

P(H) = 0.5 (from information a)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(W|H) = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (from information b)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.77

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.77.
