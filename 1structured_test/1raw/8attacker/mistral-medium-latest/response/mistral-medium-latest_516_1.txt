To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)

P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we need to find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.6

Finally, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

{probability: 0.6667}
