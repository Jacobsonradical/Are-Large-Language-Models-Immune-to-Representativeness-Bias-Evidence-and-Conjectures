To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some probabilities:

P(H) = Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(~H) = Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is also 0.5.

P(E|H) = Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(E|~H) = Probability the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information b.

Now, we want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.5] / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.88888888889 â‰ˆ 0.89
