{probability: 0.27, explanation: "Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification can be calculated as follows: P(attacker is 185+ cm | witness says 185+ cm) = [P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(attacker is 185+ cm)] / [P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(attacker is 185+ cm) + P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is <185 cm) \* P(attacker is <185 cm)] = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.27"}
