To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as H and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W. We want to find P(H|W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W). We are given the following information:

1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
3. P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
4. P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

First, let's find P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.6

Now, we can find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.6 ≈ 0.6667

However, we also have information about the distribution of attackers (point b). Let's take this into account by updating P(H) to reflect that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter:

1. P(H) = 0.15
2. P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
3. P(W|H) remains the same: 0.8
4. P(W|¬H) remains the same: 0.2

Now, let's recalculate P(W) and P(H|W) with the updated information:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.29

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.4138}
