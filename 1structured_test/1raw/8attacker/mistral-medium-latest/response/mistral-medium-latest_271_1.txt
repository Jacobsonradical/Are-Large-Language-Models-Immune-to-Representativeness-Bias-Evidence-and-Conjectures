To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's define some probabilities:

1. P(A|H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8.
2. P(A|¬H) is the probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.2.
3. P(H) is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).
4. P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
5. P(Attacker|H) is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15.
6. P(Attacker|¬H) is the probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.85.

Now, we want to find P(H|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|A) = [P(A|H) \* P(H)] / [P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|A) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

Numerator = 0.8 \* 0.5 = 0.4
Denominator = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, P(H|A) = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

However, we also have the information about the distribution of attackers (P(Attacker|H) and P(Attacker|¬H)). To incorporate this into our estimate, we can use a weighted average:

P(H|A, Attacker) = [P(Attacker|H) \* P(H|A)] / [P(Attacker|H) \* P(H|A) + P(Attacker|¬H) \* P(¬H|A)]

We don't have P(¬H|A) directly, but we can use the fact that P(¬H|A) = 1 - P(H|A). So, P(¬H|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, plugging in the values:

P(H|A, Attacker) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2)]

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

Numerator = 0.15 \* 0.8 = 0.12
Denominator = (0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(H|A, Attacker) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both pieces of information is approximately 0.4138.
