{probability: 0.252, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning behind this estimate:

1. First, let's determine the probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, the probability is 0.8.
2. Next, let's determine the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population. Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, this probability is 0.5.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to adjust our prior probability to account for this information. The revised prior probability is 0.15 (15% chance of being an attacker and 185 cm or taller).
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
5. Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
6. In our case, event A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B represents the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
7. Plugging in the values: P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(¬A) = 0.85 (since only 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm), and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time).
8. Calculating the posterior probability: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
9. The result is approximately 0.252.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.252.
