Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. From information "a", we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability for the attacker's height.
2. Information "b" tells us about a witness who identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We also know the witness's accuracy rate.
3. We need to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony. This is known as the posterior probability.

To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

Where:
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H) given the witness's testimony (E)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are actually 185 cm or taller
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(E|not H) is the probability of the witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm
- P(not H) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm

We can plug in the values from the problem:

P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate)
P(H) = 0.15 (from information "a")
P(not H) = 0.85
P(E|not H) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

The final answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.333, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Note that the number should be 0.333, not 0.33, as it is more accurate. However, if you need to round it to two decimal places, it would be 0.33.
