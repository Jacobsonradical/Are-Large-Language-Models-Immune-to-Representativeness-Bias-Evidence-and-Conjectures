To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are:

1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A)
2. The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (event B)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the given information, we can determine the following probabilities:

- P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15 / 2 = 0.075.
- P(¬A): The probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85 / 2 = 0.425.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. The witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. The witness errs 20% of the time in such cases, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / [(0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.143 / (0.143 + 0.085)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.143 / 0.228
P(A|B) ≈ 0.627

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.627.
