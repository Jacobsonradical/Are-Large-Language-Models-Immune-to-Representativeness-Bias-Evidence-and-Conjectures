To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on information a).
P(B|A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(B|¬A) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
P(B) as the prior probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(A|B) as the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From information a, we know that P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size).
From information b, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time) and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases).

We can find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
