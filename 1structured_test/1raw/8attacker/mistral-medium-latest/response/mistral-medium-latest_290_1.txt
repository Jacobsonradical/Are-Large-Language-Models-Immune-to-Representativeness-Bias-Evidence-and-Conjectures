To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the prevalence of attackers in different height categories.

First, let's calculate the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on information b:

Prior probability (P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)) = 0.15

Next, let's consider the witness's accuracy from information a. The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, so the likelihood of their testimony being accurate is:

Likelihood (witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

We also need to consider the likelihood of the witness making an error:

Likelihood (witness says "185 cm or taller" | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability \* Likelihood of accurate testimony) / (Prior probability \* Likelihood of accurate testimony + (1 - Prior probability) \* Likelihood of error)

Posterior probability = (0.15 \* 0.8) / ((0.15 \* 0.8) + (1 - 0.15) \* 0.2)

Posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.4286

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.4286}
