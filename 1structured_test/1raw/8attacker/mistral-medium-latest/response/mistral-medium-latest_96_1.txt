To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: the event that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we have:

P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|~H) = 0.2 (the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
