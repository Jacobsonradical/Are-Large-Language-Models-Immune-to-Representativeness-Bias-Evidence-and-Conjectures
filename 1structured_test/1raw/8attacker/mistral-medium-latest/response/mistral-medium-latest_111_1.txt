To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we have:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an individual as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an individual as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find P(H|W):
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:
P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
