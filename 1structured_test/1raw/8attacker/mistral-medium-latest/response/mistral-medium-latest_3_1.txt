To find an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we have:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B | A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
P(B | ¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A | B):

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / [P(B | A) \* P(A) + P(B | ¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A | B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A | B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A | B) ≈ 0.77

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.77.
