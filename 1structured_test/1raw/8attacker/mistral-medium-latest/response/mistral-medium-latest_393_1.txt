To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

We can find P(H) from the first piece of information. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that P(H) = 0.5.

We can find P(E|H) from the second piece of information. Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we have P(E|H) = 0.8.

To find P(E), we need to calculate the probability of the evidence given both the hypothesis and its negation, and then sum them up:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

We know P(E|not H) = 0.2, since the witness erred in 20% of the cases. And P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.6

Now we can find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.6 = 0.4/0.6 = 0.667

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence, is 0.667 or 66.7%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.667}
