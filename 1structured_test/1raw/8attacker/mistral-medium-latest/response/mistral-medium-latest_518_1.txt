To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. Bayes' theorem is stated as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

In our case, H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E is the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's find P(H), which is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the second piece of information, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, let's find P(E|H), which is the likelihood that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. From the first piece of information, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height of people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so:

P(E|H) = 0.80

Now, let's find P(E), which is the prior probability that the witness would identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (H) and the case where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not H). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is the weighted average of these two cases, where the weights are the prior probabilities of H and not H:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)

We already know P(E|H) and P(H), but we still need to find P(E|not H) and P(not H). From the first piece of information, we know that the witness incorrectly identifies the height of people who are shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time, so:

P(E|not H) = 0.20

And since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, we know that:

P(not H) = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(E), we get:

P(E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (P(E|H) \* P(H)) / P(E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
