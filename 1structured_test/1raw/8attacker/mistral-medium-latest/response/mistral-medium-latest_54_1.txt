To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(A). From the information given in a, we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. Therefore, P(A) = 0.5.

Next, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given in b, the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now, we need to find P(B). Using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Since P(A) = 0.5, P(not A) = 0.5. Also, the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8 or 80%.
