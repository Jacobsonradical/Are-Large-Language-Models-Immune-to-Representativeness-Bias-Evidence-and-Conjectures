To answer this question, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given in (a), we know that P(A) = 0.5, because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.

From the information given in (b), we know that the witness correctly identified the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Using the information given in (a) and (b), we can calculate:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

= (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)

= 0.4 + 0.1

= 0.5

Now that we have all the probabilities we need, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

= (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5

= 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
