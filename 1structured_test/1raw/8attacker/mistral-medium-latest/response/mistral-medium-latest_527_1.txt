To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From information (a), we know that:
P(A) = 0.5 (attackers are equally distributed between those shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5

From information (a) and (b), we can find the probabilities P(B|A) and P(B|¬A):
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

{probability: 0.8889}
