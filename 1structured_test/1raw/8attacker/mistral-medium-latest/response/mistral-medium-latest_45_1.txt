To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know that:

P(A) = 0.5, since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.

P(B|A) = 0.8, since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(B|¬A) = 0.1, since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5, we have:

P(B) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.5) = 0.45

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.5) / 0.45 ≈ 0.8889

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%.
