To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information given in points a and b.

First, let's consider the base rates of attackers' heights from point a:
P(H < 185 cm) = 0.5 (50% are shorter than 185 cm)
P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (50% are 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's incorporate the information about the witness's accuracy from point b:
P(W | H < 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification for shorter people)
P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification for people 185 cm or taller)

However, it appears that there is a discrepancy in the witness's accuracy rates provided. The problem states that the witness errs in 20% of the cases, but the given accuracy rates are both 80%. I will interpret this as follows:

P(W | H < 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification for shorter people)
P(W' | H < 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrect identification for shorter people)
P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% chance of correct identification for people 185 cm or taller)
P(W' | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrect identification for people 185 cm or taller)

Here, W represents a correct witness statement, and W' represents an incorrect witness statement.

Next, we'll find the probability that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(W | H < 185 cm) \* P(H < 185 cm) + P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) \* P(H ≥ 185 cm)
= (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.8 \* 0.5)
= 0.4 + 0.4
= 0.8

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | W) = P(W | H ≥ 185 cm) \* P(H ≥ 185 cm) / P(W)
= (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.8
= 0.4 / 0.8
= 0.5

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.5}
