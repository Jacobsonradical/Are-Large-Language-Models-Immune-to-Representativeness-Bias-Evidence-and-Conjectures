To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem. Here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. Let's denote P(H) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and P(~H) as the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. From statement a, we know that:
   - P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
   - P(~H) = 0.5

2. Let's denote E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. From statement b, we know that:
   - P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height when the person is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
   - P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height when the person is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

3. Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:
   - P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

4. Plugging in the values, we get:
   - P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
