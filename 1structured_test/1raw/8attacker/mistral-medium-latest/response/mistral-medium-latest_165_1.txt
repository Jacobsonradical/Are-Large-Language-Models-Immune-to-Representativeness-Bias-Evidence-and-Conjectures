{probability: 0.27}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's define some variables:
   - P(A) is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - P(B) is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller.
   - P(W|A) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
   - P(W|B) is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. We are given the following information:
   - P(B) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
   - P(W|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
   - P(W|B) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)
   - P(A) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)

3. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W):
   - P(A|W) = [P(W|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|B) \* P(B)]
   - P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
   - P(A|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.1]
   - P(A|W) = 0.12 / 0.22
   - P(A|W) = 0.27

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.27.
