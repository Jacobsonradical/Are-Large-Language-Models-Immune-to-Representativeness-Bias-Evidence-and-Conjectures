To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(B | A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B | ¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies an individual as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A | B) = 0.85/1.85 ≈ 0.459 (since 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, and we want the probability of being under 185 cm given the witness's identification)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) \* P(A) / [P(B | A) \* P(A) + P(B | ¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A | B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A | B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A | B) ≈ 0.78

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.78.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.78}
