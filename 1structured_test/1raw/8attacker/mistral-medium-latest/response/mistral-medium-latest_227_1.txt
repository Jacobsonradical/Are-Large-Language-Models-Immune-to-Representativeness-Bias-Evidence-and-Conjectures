To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(H) from the provided information:

a) Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can say that P(H) = 0.5.

Now, let's find P(W|H), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they truly are 185 cm or taller:

b) The witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W|H) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(W|¬H), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are not (i.e., shorter than 185 cm):

b) The witness errs in identifying the height 20% of the time, so P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in our values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.8889.
