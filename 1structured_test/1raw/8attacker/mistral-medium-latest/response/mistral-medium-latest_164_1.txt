To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of an event occurring, given some prior knowledge or evidence.

Let's define the event A as "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and the event B as "the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller." We want to find the probability of A, given B, written as P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.5 (from information a: The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information b: The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)

However, we still need to find P(B). We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given P(B|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(B|not A) and P(not A).

- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 (since the attacker is either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From information b, the witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

{probability: 0.8}
