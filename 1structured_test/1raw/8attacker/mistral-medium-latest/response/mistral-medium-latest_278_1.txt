To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: Witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem,

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided, we know:
1. P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(H) = 0.5 (equal population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
3. P(not H) = 0.5
4. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(W|not H) = 0.2

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.8888... ≈ 0.89

However, we need to consider that the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is only 15%, according to the given information. Let's denote this as P'(H). In this case, we have:

P'(not H) = 1 - P'(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we need to update our calculation using the new probabilities:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) ≈ 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4137... ≈ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the information about attackers' heights, is approximately 0.41.
