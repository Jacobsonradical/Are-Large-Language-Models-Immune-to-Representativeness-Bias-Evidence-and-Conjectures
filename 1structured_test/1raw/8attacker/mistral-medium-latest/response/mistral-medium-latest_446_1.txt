To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let's define some probabilities:

* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on information a.
* P(B|A) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information b.
* P(B|¬A) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on information b.
* P(B) is the prior probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|¬A)P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A)P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
