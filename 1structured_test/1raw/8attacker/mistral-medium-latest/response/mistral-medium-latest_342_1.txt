To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

Where:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* P(A) = 0.5 \* 0.15 = 0.075 (the population of people 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those under 185 cm, and 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is under 185 cm)
* P(¬A) = 0.5 \* 0.85 = 0.425 (the population of people under 185 cm is roughly equal in size to those 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) + (0.2 \* 0.425) = 0.12

Now we can plug in these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.075) / 0.12 = 0.06

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.06.
