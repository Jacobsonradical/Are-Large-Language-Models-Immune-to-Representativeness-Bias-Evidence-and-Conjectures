To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided.

First, let's denote:
P(H) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population
P(E|H) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(E|~H) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information given in part a, we know that:
P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases)

Now we want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889.
