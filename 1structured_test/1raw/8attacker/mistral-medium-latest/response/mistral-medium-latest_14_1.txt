To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to the first piece of information.

P(E|H) as the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the second piece of information.

P(H|E) as the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which we want to find.

To apply Bayes' theorem, we need to find P(E), the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. By the law of total probability, we have:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

Where P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.5, and P(E|~H) is the likelihood that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases and the probability of randomly guessing that an attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.5).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, is 0.8.
