{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(A)) based on information a, which states that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.
2. Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)). From information b, we know that the witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time.
3. We also need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(B|¬A)). From information b, we know that the witness errs in height identification 20% of the time.
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony (P(A|B)): P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)].
5. Plugging in our values, we get: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)].
6. Calculating the result, we find that P(A|B) ≈ 0.56.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.
