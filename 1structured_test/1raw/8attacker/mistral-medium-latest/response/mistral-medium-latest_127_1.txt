To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) given some evidence (the witness's testimony). The formula is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

Where:

- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (what we want to find)
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the witness's accuracy)
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (base rate of attackers' heights)
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (marginal likelihood)

First, let's find the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to information (b), 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis, P(E|H). Since there are two hypotheses (H: attacker is 185 cm or taller, and ~H: attacker is shorter than 185 cm), we have two probabilities to consider:

1. P(E|H): The witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness is accurate 80% of the time in such cases, P(E|H) = 0.8.
2. P(E|~H): The witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm. Given that the witness errs 20% of the time in such cases, P(E|~H) = 0.2.

Now, we need to find the marginal likelihood, P(E). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and ~H)
P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

Since P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.09 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.31

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.31.
