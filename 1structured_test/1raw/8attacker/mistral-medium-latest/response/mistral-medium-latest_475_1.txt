To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (from information a).

P(~H) as the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information b).

P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from information b).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
