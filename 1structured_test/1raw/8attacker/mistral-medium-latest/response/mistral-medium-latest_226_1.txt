To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information b.
- P(B) as the probability of the witness's testimony, which is 0.8 when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and 0.2 when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, according to information a.
- P(A|B) as the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, which is what we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

where ¬A represents the complement of A (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.85 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.085] ≈ 0.8276

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8276.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.8276}
