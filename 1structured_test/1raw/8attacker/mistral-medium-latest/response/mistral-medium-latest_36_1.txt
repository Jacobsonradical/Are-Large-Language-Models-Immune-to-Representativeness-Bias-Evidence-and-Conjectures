To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From information a, we know that P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size) and P(¬A) = 0.5.

From the same information, we also know that P(attacker is an under-185-cm-tall attacker | attacker is under 185 cm tall) = 0.85/0.5 = 1.7, so P(attacker is a 185-cm-or-taller attacker | attacker is under 185 cm tall) = 1 - 1.7 = -0.7. However, this is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem statement or my interpretation of it. The statement "85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm" is unclear, as it does not specify whether it refers to all attackers or only those who are under 185 cm tall. Assuming that it means that 85% of all attackers are under 185 cm tall, we can calculate P(attacker is an under-185-cm-tall attacker) = 0.85 and P(attacker is a 185-cm-or-taller attacker) = 0.15.

From information b, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time) and P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is under 185 cm tall).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 8/9 ≈ 0.889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.889.
