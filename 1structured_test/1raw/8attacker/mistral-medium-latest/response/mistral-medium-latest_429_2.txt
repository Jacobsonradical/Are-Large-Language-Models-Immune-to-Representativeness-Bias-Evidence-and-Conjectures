To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we want to estimate this)
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(B|A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(B|¬A) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we know:

P(A) = 0.5 (since half of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5 (half of the population is shorter than 185 cm):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1] = 0.4 / 0.5 = 0.8

So, given the witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.
