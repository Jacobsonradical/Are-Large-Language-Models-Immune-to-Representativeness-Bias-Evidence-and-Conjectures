To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information given, we can determine the following probabilities:

* P(H): the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, P(H) = 0.5.
* P(¬H): the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5.
* P(W|H): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the witness's accuracy, P(W|H) = 0.8.
* P(W|¬H): the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(W|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|W) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|W) ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889 or 88.89%. However, we should note that this estimate does not take into account the information about the distribution of attackers' heights (85% of attackers being shorter than 185 cm and 15% being 185 cm or taller). The provided witness accuracy information is based on general population heights, not specifically on attackers' heights. If we had witness accuracy data specific to attackers' heights, the estimate might change.
