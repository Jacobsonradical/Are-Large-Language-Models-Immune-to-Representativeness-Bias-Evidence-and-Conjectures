To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events, A and B. In this case, the events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

From the problem statement, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.5 (the population of people who are 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size to those who are shorter)

However, we also need to consider the prior probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17 (0.85 is the percentage of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm). Thus, P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.17 \* 0.5 = 0.585.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.585 = 0.6807. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is approximately 0.6807.
