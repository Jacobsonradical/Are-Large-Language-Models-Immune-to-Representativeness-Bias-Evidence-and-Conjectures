To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without the witness information), and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony.

From the provided information:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
