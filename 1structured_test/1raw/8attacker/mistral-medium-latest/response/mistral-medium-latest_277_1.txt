To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:

* H represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E represents the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
* ~H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* ~E represents the witness's testimony that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(~H) = 0.5 (the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
* P(attacker is H) = 0.15 (only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(attacker is ~H) = 0.85 (85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm)

However, we need to adjust the witness's accuracy based on the prevalence of attackers with different heights. To do this, we can use the following adjusted probabilities:

* P'(E|H) = P(E|H) \* P(attacker is H) / [P(attacker is H) \* P(E|H) + P(attacker is ~H) \* P(E|~H)] = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2)] ≈ 0.14
* P'(E|~H) = P(E|~H) \* P(attacker is ~H) / [P(attacker is H) \* P(E|H) + P(attacker is ~H) \* P(E|~H)] = (0.2 \* 0.85) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.2)] ≈ 0.26

Now we can use Bayes' theorem with the adjusted probabilities:

P'(H|E) = [P'(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P'(E|H) \* P(H) + P'(E|~H) \* P(~H)] ≈ [0.14 \* 0.5] / [(0.14 \* 0.5) + (0.26 \* 0.5)] ≈ 0.36

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.
