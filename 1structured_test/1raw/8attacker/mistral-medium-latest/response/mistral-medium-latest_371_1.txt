To answer this question, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

First, let's find the prior probability P(A). Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size, the probability that an attacker would be 185 cm or taller is 0.5.

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability that the witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the witness correctly identified heights 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now we need to find the probability P(B), which is the probability that the witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can't calculate this directly from the information provided, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since ¬A represents the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5. Also, P(B|¬A) is the probability that the witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the information provided, the witness erred in 20% of the cases, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is 0.8.
