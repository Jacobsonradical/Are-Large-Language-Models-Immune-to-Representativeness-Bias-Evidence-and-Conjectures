To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without the witness's information).
P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From the provided information, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time).
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

First, let's calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / (0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.8889.
