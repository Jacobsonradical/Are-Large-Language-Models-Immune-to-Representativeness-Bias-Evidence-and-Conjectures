To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information provided:

1. P(A) = 0.5, as the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
2. P(B|A) = 0.8, as the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time.
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2, as the witness erred in 20% of the cases when identifying the height of people shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the values:

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2 \* 0.5)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)

P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9

P(A|B) = 0.888888888888889

Rounding to four decimal places:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889.
