To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given, we know:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.5
P(B|A) = 1 (since the witness always correctly identifies heights for people who are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying heights for people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (1 \* 0.5) / [(1 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)] = 0.6667

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.6667.
