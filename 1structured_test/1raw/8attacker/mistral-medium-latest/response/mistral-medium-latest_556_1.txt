To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

* H: the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller
* P(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis H (before seeing the evidence)
* P(E|H): the likelihood of the evidence E given the hypothesis H
* P(E|¬H): the likelihood of the evidence E given the negation of the hypothesis H
* P(H|E): the posterior probability of the hypothesis H given the evidence E (what we want to find)

From the information given, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5, because the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size.
* P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8, because the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller.
* P(E|¬H) = 0.2, because the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm.

We also know that:

* P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / (P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P(¬H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

* P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / (0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2) = 0.8 / 1 = 0.8

However, we need to adjust this probability to take into account the fact that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. Let's denote:

* P'(H): the prior probability of the hypothesis H given the attacker population
* P'(¬H): the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis H given the attacker population

We know that:

* P'(H) = 0.15
* P'(¬H) = 1 - P'(H) = 0.85

The likelihoods P(E|H) and P(E|¬H) remain the same, because they depend only on the witness's ability to judge height, not on the attacker population. Therefore, we can use the same formula as before to calculate the posterior probability P'(H|E):

* P'(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P'(H) / (P(E|H) \* P'(H) + P(E|¬H) \* P'(¬H))

Plugging in the values, we get:

* P'(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the attacker population, is approximately 0.41.
