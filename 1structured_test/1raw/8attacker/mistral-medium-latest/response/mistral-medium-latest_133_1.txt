{probability: 0.47, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's how to calculate the probability:

1. First, we need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (from information a).
2. Next, we need to find the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller. This is called the true positive rate (TPR), which is 80% (from information b).
3. We also need to find the probability that the witness would identify an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm. This is called the false positive rate (FPR), which is 20% (from information b).
4. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(Taller | Witness says taller) = [P(Witness says taller | Taller) \* P(Taller)] / [P(Witness says taller | Taller) \* P(Taller) + P(Witness says taller | Shorter) \* P(Shorter)]

= (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

= 0.47

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the available information, is approximately 0.47.
