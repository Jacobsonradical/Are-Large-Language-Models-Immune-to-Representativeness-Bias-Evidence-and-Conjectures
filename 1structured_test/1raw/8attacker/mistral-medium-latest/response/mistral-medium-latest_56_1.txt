To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the witness identified them as such (event B).

From the information provided, we can identify some probabilities:

1. P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
2. P(A): The probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information given, this is 15% (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller).
3. P(B): The probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. This is not explicitly given, but we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.522.
