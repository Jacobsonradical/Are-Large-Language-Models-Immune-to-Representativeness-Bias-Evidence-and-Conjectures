To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E: The witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.5 (equal population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
P(E|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(E|~H) = 0.2 (witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(H|E) ≈ 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.8889.
