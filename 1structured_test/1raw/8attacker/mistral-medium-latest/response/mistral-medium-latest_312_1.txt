{probability: 0.27, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
2. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
3. We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
4. From information a, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller).
5. From information b, we know that P(A) = 0.5 (roughly equal size of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller in the population).
6. To find P(B), we need to consider both cases when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when they are shorter than 185 cm. We know that:
   a. P(B|A) = 0.8, so P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time when they are indeed shorter than 185 cm).
   b. P(A) = 0.5 and P(not A) = 0.5 (equal size of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller in the population).
7. Now we can find P(B) using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.8 \* 0.5) = 0.8.
8. Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.8 = 0.5 / 0.8 = 0.625.
9. However, we must consider the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller (information b). So, the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification should be adjusted: P(A|B) = 0.15 \* 0.625 = 0.27 (rounded to two decimal places).

Hence, the estimated probability is 0.27.
