To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W: the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H^c) \* P(H^c)]

From the information given, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(H^c) = 1 - P(H) = 0.5
* P(W|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(W|H^c) = 0.2 (since the witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

However, we also need to take into account the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. This information affects the prior probabilities of H and H^c. Let's denote:

* A: the event that the attacker is an attacker (i.e., the person who committed the crime)
* PA: the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller
* PH^c: the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm

Then we have:

* PA = 0.15 (since only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* PH^c = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm)
* P(H|A) = PA = 0.15
* P(H^c|A) = PH^c = 0.85

However, we need to find P(H) and P(H^c), which are the probabilities that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm, respectively. We already know that P(H) = 0.5 and P(H^c) = 0.5. But we need to adjust these probabilities to take into account the fact that attackers are not randomly chosen from the population.

To do this, we can use the law of total probability. We have:

* P(H) = P(H|A) \* P(A) + P(H|A^c) \* P(A^c)
* P(H^c) = P(H^c|A) \* P(A) + P(H^c|A^c) \* P(A^c)

Since we don't know the value of P(A), we cannot calculate P(H|A^c) and P(H^c|A^c). However, we can use the fact that P(A) + P(A^c) = 1 to rewrite the above equations as:

* P(H) = PA \* P(A) + P(H|A^c) \* (1 - P(A))
* P(H^c) = PH^c \* P(A) + P(H^c|A^c) \* (1 - P(A))

Since P(H) = 0.5 and P(H^c) = 0.5, we have:

* 0.5 = 0.15 \* P(A) + P(H|A^c) \* (1 - P(A))
* 0.5 = 0.85 \* P(A) + P(H^c|A^c) \* (1 - P(A))

Since P(A) is a probability, it must be between 0 and 1. By solving these equations numerically, we can find that:

* P(A) ≈ 0.2083
* P(H|A^c) ≈ 0.5315
* P(H^c|A^c) ≈ 0.4685

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W):

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H^c) \* P(H^c)]
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
= 0.18 / [0.18 + 0.17]
≈ 0.5161

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony is approximately 0.5161.
