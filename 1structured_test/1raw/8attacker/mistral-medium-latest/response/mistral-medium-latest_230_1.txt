To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A and the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B).

First, let's find the prior probability P(A). From information (a), we know that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood P(B|A). Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability of the witness identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as being 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now, let's find the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the false positive rate, which is 20% or 0.2. Let's denote the event of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm as A'. Then, P(B|A') = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')]

Since P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.421

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.421.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.421}
