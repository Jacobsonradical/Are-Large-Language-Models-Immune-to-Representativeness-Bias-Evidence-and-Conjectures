To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information provided and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
P(H) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(E|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 according to information b.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.8 / 0.9 ≈ 0.8889

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.8889.
