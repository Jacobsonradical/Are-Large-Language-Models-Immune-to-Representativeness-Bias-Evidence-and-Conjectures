To find an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given that P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size).

From point a, we know that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so P(A|attacker) = 0.15. Since the victim was attacked, we can adjust this probability to account for the fact that the attacker comes from the attacker population rather than the general population:

P(A) = P(A|attacker) / (P(A|attacker) + P(¬A|attacker)) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.85) = 0.15 / 1 = 0.15

Now, we need P(B|A). Since the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We also know that the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2. Finally, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the desired probability:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
