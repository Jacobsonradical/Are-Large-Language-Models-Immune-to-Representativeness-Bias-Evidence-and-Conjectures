To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability of A given B, P(A|B). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we can estimate the following probabilities:

* P(A): Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can estimate P(A) to be approximately 0.5.
* P(B|A): Since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, we can estimate P(B|A) to be 0.8.
* P(B|¬A): Since the witness erred in identifying height 20% of the time, we can estimate P(B|¬A) to be 0.2.
* P(B): Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B) as follows: P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 0.8.

Therefore {probability: 0.8}
