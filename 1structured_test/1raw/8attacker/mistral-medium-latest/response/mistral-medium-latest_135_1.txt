To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as E. We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)]

where P(H) and P(~H) are the prior probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively. P(E|H) and P(E|~H) are the conditional probabilities of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

From the information given, we have:

* P(H) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
* P(~H) = 0.5
* P(E|H) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm, and we can assume that the witness is equally likely to make a mistake in either direction)

Now we can plug in these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / [0.8 + 0.1]
P(H|E) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(H|E) ≈ 0.89

However, we also need to consider the fact that 85% of attackers are people under 185 cm. This information affects the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which was assumed to be 0.5.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is an attacker as A. Then we can write:

P(H|E, A) = P(E|H, A) \* P(H|A) / [P(E|H, A) \* P(H|A) + P(E|~H, A) \* P(~H|A)]

Since the witness's testimony is independent of whether or not the attacker is an attacker, we have P(E|H, A) = P(E|H) and P(E|~H, A) = P(E|~H). Therefore, we can simplify the equation to:

P(H|E, A) = P(H|A) / [P(H|A) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H|A) / P(E|H)]

From the information given, we have:

* P(H|A) = 0.15 (since only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller)
* P(~H|A) = 0.85
* P(E|H) = 0.8
* P(E|~H) = 0.2

Now we can plug in these values into the equation:

P(H|E, A) = 0.15 / [0.15 + (0.2 \* 0.85) / 0.8]
P(H|E, A) = 0.15 / [0.15 + 0.2125]
P(H|E, A) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the fact that the attacker is an attacker, is approximately 0.41.
