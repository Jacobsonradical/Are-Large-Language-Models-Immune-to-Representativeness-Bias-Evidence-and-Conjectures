To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 according to information a.
P(B|A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(B|¬A) as the probability of the witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not 185 cm or taller (shorter than 185 cm), which is 0.2 according to information b.

Then we want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / [0.4 + 0.1]
P(A|B) = 0.4 / 0.5
