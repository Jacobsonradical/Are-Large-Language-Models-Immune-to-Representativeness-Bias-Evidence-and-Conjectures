To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (without any information about the witness), and P(B) as the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

From the information provided:

1. P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / [(0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) ≈ 0.8889 or 88.89%

However, we need to provide an answer between 0 and 1, so:

{probability: 0.8889}
