To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a) and (b).

First, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the witness's testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

We are given:

P(A) = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identified the height of a person 80% of the time)

Now we need to find P(W). We can do this by using the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|A') \* P(A')

Where A' represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that P(A') = 0.5 and P(W|A') = 0.2 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases). Plugging these values in:

P(W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) + (0.2 \* 0.5) = 0.5

Now we can find P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

However, this probability does not take into account the information in (a) that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller. To incorporate this information, we need to update our prior probability P(A) from 0.5 to 0.15.

So, using Bayes' theorem again with the updated prior:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / P(W)

Since P(W) remains the same (0.5), and P(W|A) is still 0.8, we have:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.5 = 0.24

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24, taking into account both pieces of information.
