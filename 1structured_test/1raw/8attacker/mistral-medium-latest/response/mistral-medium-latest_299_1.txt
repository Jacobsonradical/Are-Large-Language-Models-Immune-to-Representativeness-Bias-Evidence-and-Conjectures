To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information (a and b) provided and use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|H^c) \* P(H^c)]

Now, let's find the values for each term in the equation:

1. P(W|H): The probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From information (a), this is 80% or 0.8.
2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From information (b), the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size. However, only 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(H) = 0.15.
3. P(W|H^c): The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), this is 20% or 0.2.
4. P(H^c): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal in size and 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, P(H^c) = 0.85.

Now, we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the result:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, since we're required to provide a probability between 0 and 1:

{probability: 0.357}
