To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the events are:

A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find the probabilities P(A), P(B|A), and P(B):

From information a:
P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%) / (0.15 + 0.5) = 0.15 / 0.65 ≈ 0.2308

From information b:
P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (80%)

P(B) = Probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

From information b:
P(B|¬A) = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (20%)

P(¬A) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 1 - P(A) ≈ 0.7692

Now we can find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) ≈ 0.80 \* 0.2308 + 0.20 \* 0.7692 ≈ 0.3316

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) ≈ 0.80 \* 0.2308 / 0.3316 ≈ 0.5756

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.5756.
