To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information and use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 based on information b.
P(W|H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information a.
P(W|~H) as the probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on information a.
P(A|H) as the probability of an attack being committed by someone 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information b.
P(A|~H) as the probability of an attack being committed by someone shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 based on information b.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = 0.8 \* 0.5 / [0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* 0.5 \* (0.85 / 0.15)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.5926

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony and the information about the population and attacker statistics, is approximately 0.5926.
