To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(H|E) = 0.8, the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(H|E') = 0.2, the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(E) = 0.15, the prior probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(E') = 0.85, the prior probability that an attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(E|H), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(E|H) = (P(H|E) * P(E)) / (P(H|E) * P(E) + P(H|E') * P(E'))

Substituting the given values:
P(E|H) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(E|H) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(E|H) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(E|H) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
