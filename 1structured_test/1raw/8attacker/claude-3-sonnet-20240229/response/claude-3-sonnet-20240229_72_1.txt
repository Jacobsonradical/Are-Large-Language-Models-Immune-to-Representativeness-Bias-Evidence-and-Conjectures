To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given some evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
       = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 (from the given information)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4138.
