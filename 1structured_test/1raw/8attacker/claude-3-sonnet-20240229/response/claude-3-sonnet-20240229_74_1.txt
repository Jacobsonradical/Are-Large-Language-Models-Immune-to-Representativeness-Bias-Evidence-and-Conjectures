To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from the witness's assessment)
- P(height < 185 cm) = 0.5
- P(identified as ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from the witness's ability to correctly identify height)
- P(identified as ≥ 185 cm | height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from the witness's ability to incorrectly identify height)
- P(attacker is ≥ 185 cm | identified as ≥ 185 cm) is the probability we want to find.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is ≥ 185 cm | identified as ≥ 185 cm) = (P(identified as ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) × P(height ≥ 185 cm)) / (P(identified as ≥ 185 cm | height ≥ 185 cm) × P(height ≥ 185 cm) + P(identified as ≥ 185 cm | height < 185 cm) × P(height < 185 cm))

Substituting the given values:
P(attacker is ≥ 185 cm | identified as ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.5) / (0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5)
= 0.4 / 0.5
= 0.8

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
