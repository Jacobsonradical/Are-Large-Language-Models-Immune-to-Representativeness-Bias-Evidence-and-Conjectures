To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(not A)
     = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
     = 0.33

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.33
       = 0.3636

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.3636}
