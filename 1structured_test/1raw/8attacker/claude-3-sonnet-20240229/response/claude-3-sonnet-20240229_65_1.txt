To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities involved in the problem.

Given:
- P(H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from the population information)
- P(H < 185 cm) = 0.5
- P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy for tall people)
- P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm | H < 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness's error rate for short people)

We want to find P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm)

P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm | H ≥ 185 cm) × P(H ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm | H < 185 cm) × P(H < 185 cm)
P(Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.5

Substituting the values:
P(H ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies H ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
