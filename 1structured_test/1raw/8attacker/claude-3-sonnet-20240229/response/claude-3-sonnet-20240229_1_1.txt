To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of their actual height.

P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A^c) × P(A^c)
     = (0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
