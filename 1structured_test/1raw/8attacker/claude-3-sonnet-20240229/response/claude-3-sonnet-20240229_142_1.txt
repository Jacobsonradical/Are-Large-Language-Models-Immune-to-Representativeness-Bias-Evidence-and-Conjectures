To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller people 80% of the time)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

We know that P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
