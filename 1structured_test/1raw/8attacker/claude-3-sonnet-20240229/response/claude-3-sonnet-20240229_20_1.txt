To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(Witness correct | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from information "a")
- P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from information "b")
- P(Witness correct | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from information "a", assuming the witness errs 20% of the time for both cases)

We want to find P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct) = (P(Witness correct | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) × P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Witness correct)

P(Witness correct) = P(Witness correct | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) × P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness correct | Attacker < 185 cm) × P(Attacker < 185 cm)
P(Witness correct) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85
P(Witness correct) = 0.27

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.27
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct) ≈ 0.444

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.444 or 44.4%.
