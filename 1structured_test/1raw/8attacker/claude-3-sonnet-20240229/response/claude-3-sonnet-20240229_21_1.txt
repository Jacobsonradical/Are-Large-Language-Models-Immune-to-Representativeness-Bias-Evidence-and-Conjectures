To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Given information:
- P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from population distribution)
- P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.5 (from population distribution)
- P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from witness assessment)
- P(Witness identifies correctly | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from witness assessment)

We want to find P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm)

P(Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies incorrectly | Height < 185 cm) × P(Height < 185 cm)
P(Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 × 0.5 + 0.8 × 0.5 = 0.8

Substituting the values:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies as ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.5) / 0.8 = 0.5

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.5}
