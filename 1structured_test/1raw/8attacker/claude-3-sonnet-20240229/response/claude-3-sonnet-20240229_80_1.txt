To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|¬A) × P(¬A)
        = 0.8 × 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) × 0.85
        = 0.12 + 0.17
        = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.
