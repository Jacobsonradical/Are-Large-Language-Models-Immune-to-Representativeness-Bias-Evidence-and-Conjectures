To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events to determine the probability of one event given the occurrence of another event.

Given:
- P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from information "b")
- P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.5 (from information "b")
- P(Identified as ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from information "b")
- P(Identified as ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from information "b")
- P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (from information "a")
- P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from information "a")

We want to find P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as ≥ 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Identified as ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm)) / (P(Identified as ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Identified as ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) × P(Height < 185 cm))

Substituting the given values:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4138.
