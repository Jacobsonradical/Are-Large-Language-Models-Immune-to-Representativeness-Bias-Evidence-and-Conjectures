To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and provides a way to update the probability of an event based on new information.

Given:
- P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from the witness's sample)
- P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy for identifying tall people)
- P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (witness's error rate for identifying short people as tall)
- P(Height < 185 cm) = 0.5 (from the witness's sample)
- P(Attacker is Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from information "a")

We want to find P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm)

P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm) = P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) × P(Height < 185 cm)
P(Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.5

Substituting the values:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Identified as Height ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
