To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
