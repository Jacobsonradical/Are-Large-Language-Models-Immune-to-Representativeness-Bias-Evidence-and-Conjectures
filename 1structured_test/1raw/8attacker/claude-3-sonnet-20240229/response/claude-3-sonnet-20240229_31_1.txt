To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "a")
- P(B|A) = Probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information "b")
- P(B|A') = Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information "b")

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
