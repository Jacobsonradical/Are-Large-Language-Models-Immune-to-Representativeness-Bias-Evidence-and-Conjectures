To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events, given some additional information. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider the total probability of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of the probabilities for the two cases:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Here, P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate it as:

P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
