To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events based on the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A'), where A' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We don't have the value of P(B|A'), but we can find it using the given information that the witness errs in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|A') = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.41}
