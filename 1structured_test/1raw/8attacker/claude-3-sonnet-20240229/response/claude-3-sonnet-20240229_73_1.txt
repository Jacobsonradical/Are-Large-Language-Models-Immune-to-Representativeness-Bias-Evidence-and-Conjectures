To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Given information:
- P(Height < 185 cm) = P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (the population is roughly equal)
- P(Attacker | Height < 185 cm) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- P(Attacker | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(Witness correct | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (20% error rate for shorter people)
- P(Witness correct | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (80% accuracy for taller people)

We want to find P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct, Attacker), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct, Attacker) = (P(Witness correct | Height ≥ 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Attacker)) / P(Witness correct | Attacker)

P(Witness correct | Attacker) = P(Witness correct | Height < 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height < 185 cm | Attacker) + P(Witness correct | Height ≥ 185 cm, Attacker) * P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Attacker)
                             = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15
                             = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness correct, Attacker) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
                                                = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.414}
