To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "b")
- P(B|A) = Probability of witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as such = 0.8 (from information "a")
- P(B|A') = Probability of witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (from information "a")
- P(A') = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information "b")

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A'))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
