To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.5 (The population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size.)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller.)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness erred in 20% of the cases for people shorter than 185 cm.)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.5

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.5) / 0.5 = 0.8

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.8}
