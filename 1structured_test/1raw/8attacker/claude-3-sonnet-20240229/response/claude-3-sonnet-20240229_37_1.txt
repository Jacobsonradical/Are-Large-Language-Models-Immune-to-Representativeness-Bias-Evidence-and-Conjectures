To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update the prior probability based on the new evidence (the witness's testimony).

Given:
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "b").
- Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information "a").
- Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information "a").

Let's denote the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the event "witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller" as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414.
