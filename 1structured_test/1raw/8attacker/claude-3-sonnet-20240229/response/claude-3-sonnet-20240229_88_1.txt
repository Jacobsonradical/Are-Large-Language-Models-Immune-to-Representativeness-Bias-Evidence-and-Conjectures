To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B), the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
