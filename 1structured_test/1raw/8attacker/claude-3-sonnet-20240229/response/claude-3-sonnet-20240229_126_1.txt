To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (the witness misidentifies a person shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is approximately 0.4138.
