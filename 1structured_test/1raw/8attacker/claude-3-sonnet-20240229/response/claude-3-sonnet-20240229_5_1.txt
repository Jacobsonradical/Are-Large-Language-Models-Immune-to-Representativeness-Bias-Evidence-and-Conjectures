To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (assuming the witness has a 20% error rate for people shorter than 185 cm)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137...

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
