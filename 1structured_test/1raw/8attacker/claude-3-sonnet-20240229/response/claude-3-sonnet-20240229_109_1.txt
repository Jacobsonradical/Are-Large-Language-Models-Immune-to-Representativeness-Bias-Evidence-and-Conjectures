To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)

Where A^c is the complement of event A (i.e., the attacker's height is under 185 cm).

We don't have P(B|A^c) directly, but we know that:
P(B|A^c) + P(correct identification|A^c) = 1

Since the witness correctly identifies people under 185 cm 80% of the time, we have:
P(B|A^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
