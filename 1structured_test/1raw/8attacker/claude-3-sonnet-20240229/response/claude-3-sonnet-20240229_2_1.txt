To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, according to information "a")
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, according to information "b")
- P(B) needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
  where A^c is the complement of event A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).
  We don't have the value of P(B|A^c), but we can use the given information that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, which means P(B|A^c) = 0.2.
  P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.414}
