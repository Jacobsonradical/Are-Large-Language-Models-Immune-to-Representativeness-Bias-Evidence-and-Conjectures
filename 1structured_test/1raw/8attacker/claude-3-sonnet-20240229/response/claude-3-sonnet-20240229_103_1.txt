To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the complement of A (attacker's height is less than 185 cm)

We don't have the value of P(B|A^c), but we can calculate it using the information provided.

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller is roughly equal, we can assume P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm).

The witness errs 20% of the time, so P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies 20% of people under 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

Substituting the values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.414}
