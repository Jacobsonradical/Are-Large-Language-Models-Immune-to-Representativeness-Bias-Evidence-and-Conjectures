To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a": 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information "b": the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (from information "b": the witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.23

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23
       = 0.52174

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness identification, is:

{probability: 0.52174}
