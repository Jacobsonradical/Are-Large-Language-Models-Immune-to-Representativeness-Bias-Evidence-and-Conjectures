To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (Using the information that 20% of the time the witness errs for people under 185 cm)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
