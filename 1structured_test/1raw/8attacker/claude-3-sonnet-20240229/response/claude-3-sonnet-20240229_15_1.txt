To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A^c) * P(A^c), where A^c is the complement of A (attacker's height is less than 185 cm)
- P(B|A^c) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is approximately 0.4138.
