To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The witness incorrectly identified height 20% of the time when the person was under 185 cm)

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
