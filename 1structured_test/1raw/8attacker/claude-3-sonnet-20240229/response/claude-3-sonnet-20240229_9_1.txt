To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Where A' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that P(A') = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm).
We also know that P(B|A') = 0.2 (The witness misidentifies a person's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.4138}
