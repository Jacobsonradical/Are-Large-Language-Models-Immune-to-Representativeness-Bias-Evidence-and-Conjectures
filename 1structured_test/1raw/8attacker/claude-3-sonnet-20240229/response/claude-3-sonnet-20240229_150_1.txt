To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the available information.

Given:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "b")
- P(B|A) = Probability of the witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information "a")
- P(B|A') = Probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information "a")
- P(A') = Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information "b")

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|A') × P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

{probability: 0.41}
