To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(witness correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from "a")
- P(witness incorrect | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from "a")
- P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15 (from "b")
- P(attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85 (from "b")

We want to find P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness correct).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness correct) = (P(witness correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) × P(attacker ≥ 185 cm)) / P(witness correct)

To find P(witness correct), we need to consider both possibilities:
P(witness correct) = P(witness correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) × P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness correct | attacker < 185 cm) × P(attacker < 185 cm)
P(witness correct) = 0.8 × 0.15 + (1 - 0.2) × 0.85
P(witness correct) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Substituting the values, we get:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness correct) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.1875

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is:

{probability: 0.1875}
