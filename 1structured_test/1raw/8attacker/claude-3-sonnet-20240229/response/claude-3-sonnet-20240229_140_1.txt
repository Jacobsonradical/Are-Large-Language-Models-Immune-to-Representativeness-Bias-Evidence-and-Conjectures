To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Given:
- P(Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.5 (from the equal population distribution)
- P(Attacker's height ≥ 185 cm | Attacker) = 0.15 (from the information in "a")
- P(Witness identifies correctly | Height ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (from the information in "b")
- P(Witness identifies incorrectly | Height < 185 cm) = 0.2 (from the information in "b")

We want to find P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = (P(Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm)

P(Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | Height ≥ 185 cm) × P(Height ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm | Height < 185 cm) × P(Height < 185 cm)
                             = 0.8 × 0.5 + 0.2 × 0.5
                             = 0.5

Substituting the values:
P(Height ≥ 185 cm | Witness identifies ≥ 185 cm) = (0.8 × 0.5) / 0.5
                                                 = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8.
