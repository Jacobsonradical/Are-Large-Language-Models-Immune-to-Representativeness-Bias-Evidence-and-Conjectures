Based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases where the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness erred in 20% of the cases where the person was shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, the probability is approximately 0.34.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.34}
