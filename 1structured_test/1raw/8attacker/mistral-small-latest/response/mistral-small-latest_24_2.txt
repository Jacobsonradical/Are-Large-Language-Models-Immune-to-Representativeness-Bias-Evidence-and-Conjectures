{probability: 0.26,

Explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. We are given the prior probability (probability before witness testimony) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%). The witness correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time. We want to find the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Probability of witness being correct) / (Prior probability * Probability of witness being correct) + (Prior probability of attacker being under 185 cm * Probability of witness making an error)

= (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
â‰ˆ 0.26

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.26.}
