{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, the base rate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. However, the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so we need to adjust this base rate by the witness's accuracy. This can be done using Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = [P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness says so). We know that P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy for this group), P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15, and P(Witness says so) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(Witness says so) = P(Witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness says so | Attacker is under 185 cm) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm). Since the population is equally divided, P(Attacker is under 185 cm) is 0.5, and assuming the witness's error rate for the under 185 cm group is the same (0.2), P(Witness says so | Attacker is under 185 cm) is 0.2. Substituting these values, we get P(Witness says so) = 0.12 + 0.5*0.2 = 0.22. Therefore, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness says so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.56.}
