{probability: 0.52, Given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy in identifying heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as follows:

1. There is a 15% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller according to information (a).
2. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so there is an 80% * 15% = 0.12 chance that the witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
3. However, the witness can also make a false positive identification, incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller. This happens 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the chance of making this mistake is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10.
4. Adding these two probabilities together, there is a 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22 chance that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability: P(taller | witness) = P(witness | taller) * P(taller) / P(witness) = (0.12) * (0.5) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.52

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.52.}
