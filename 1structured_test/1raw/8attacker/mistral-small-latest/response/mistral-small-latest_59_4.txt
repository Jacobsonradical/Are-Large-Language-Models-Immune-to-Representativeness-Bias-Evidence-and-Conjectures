{probability: 0.525, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness's correct identification given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). The probability of the witness's correct identification regardless of the attacker's height is 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5 (since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size). Therefore, the posterior probability (estimate) is 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.5 = 0.525.}
