{probability: 0.40, This is based on the assumption that the witness is equally likely to encounter a shorter or taller person, and takes into account the witness's accuracy in identifying height. Given that 15% of all attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller. Since there is an equal population of shorter and taller people, this error would affect 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 of the shorter population, which equates to 0.1 * 0.85 = 0.085 of all attackers. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.085 = 0.405, which we round to 0.40.}
