{probability: 0.28, Explanation: Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5. However, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, which reduces our prior probability to 0.15. Now, we need to account for the witness's reliability. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. The probability of this error is 0.2 (error rate) * 0.85 (probability of a shorter attacker) = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.28.}
