{probability: 0.44, Explanation: Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5. However, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so the actual probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made an error and identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. The probability of this error is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.44.}
