{probability: 0.36, this is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying someone of this height (0.8), which equals 0.12, then adding this to the probability of the witness misidentifying someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), resulting in a total probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.36}
