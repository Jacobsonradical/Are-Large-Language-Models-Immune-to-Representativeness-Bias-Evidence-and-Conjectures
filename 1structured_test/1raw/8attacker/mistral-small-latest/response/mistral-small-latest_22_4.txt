{probability: 0.56, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) with the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability that the witness made an error and identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller (0.4, which is half of the population times the witness's error rate of 0.2). So, 0.12 + 0.4 = 0.56.}
