To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

From the information given:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A)

Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, we can assume that P(not A) = 0.5. Also, the witness makes an error 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

So, P(B) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.5 = 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.22

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.545.

Answer: {probability: 0.545}
