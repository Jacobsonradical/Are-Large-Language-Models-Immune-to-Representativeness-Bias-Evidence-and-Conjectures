{probability: 0.34, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so we multiply the prior probability by the witness's accuracy to get a posterior probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this error is 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter) times 0.2 (the witness's error rate), which equals 0.17. So the total probability that the witness's identification is correct is 0.12 (the attacker is tall and the witness is correct) plus 0.17 (the attacker is short and the witness made an error), which equals 0.34.}
