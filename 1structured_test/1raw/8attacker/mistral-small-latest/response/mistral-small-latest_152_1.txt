{probability: 0.45,
Explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, our initial estimate would be 0.15. However, we also have information about the witness's accuracy in identifying heights. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). But since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we multiply these two probabilities together to get the final estimate: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.45.}
