{probability: 0.45, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the given information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually that height is 0.8 (from the given information a). So, the posterior probability is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.45.}
