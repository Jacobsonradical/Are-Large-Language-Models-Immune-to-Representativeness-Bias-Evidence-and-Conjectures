{probability: 0.306, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. Let's denote E as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and A as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. We are trying to find P(A|E), the probability of A given E. We can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E). From the information given, P(E|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller), and P(E) can be calculated using the total probability theorem: P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A), where P(not A) = 0.85 and P(E|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (given in the error rate). So, P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22. Therefore, P(A|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.306.}
