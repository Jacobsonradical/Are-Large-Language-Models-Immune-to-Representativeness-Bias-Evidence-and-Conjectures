{probability: 0.26,

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. Let's first consider the witness's accuracy in identifying heights. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

2. However, we also know from information b that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller.

3. So, to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, we need to use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

4. We have P(B|A) = 0.8 from step 1, P(A) = 0.15 from information b, and P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since the witness correctly identifies height in 80% of all cases, P(B|not A) = 0.2. And since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.25.

5. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.25 = 0.26.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.26.
