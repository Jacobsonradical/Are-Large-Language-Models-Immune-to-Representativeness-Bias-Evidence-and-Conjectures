{probability: 0.49, The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.49. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the likelihood that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8), giving us a posterior probability of 0.12. However, since the witness's errors are made equally between underestimating and overestimating, we need to account for the possibility that the witness could have incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and the witness has a 20% error rate, there's a 0.17 probability (0.85 * 0.2) that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as tall. Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.17 (incorrect identification) = 0.49.}
