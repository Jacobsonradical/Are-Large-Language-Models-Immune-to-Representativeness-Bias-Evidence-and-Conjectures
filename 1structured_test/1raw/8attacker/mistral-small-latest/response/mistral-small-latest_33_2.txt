{probability: 0.26, estimate: Given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy rate, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.26. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying such individuals (0.8).}
