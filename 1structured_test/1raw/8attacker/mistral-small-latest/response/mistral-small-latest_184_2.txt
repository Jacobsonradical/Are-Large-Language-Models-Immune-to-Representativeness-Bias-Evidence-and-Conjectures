{probability: 0.26, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy in estimating height and the distribution of attacker heights, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, so we need to find the probability of this being true given the witness's observation. Using the provided data, this probability is approximately 0.26.}
