{probability: 0.28, Given the witness's 80% accuracy and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the witness's 20% error rate in identifying shorter people as taller. So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, despite actually being shorter, is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.28.}
