{probability: 0.42, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate for correctly identifying people of that height (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we add this to the product of the base rate of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm (0.85) and the witness's error rate for incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller (0.2), which gives us 0.17. So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.42.}
