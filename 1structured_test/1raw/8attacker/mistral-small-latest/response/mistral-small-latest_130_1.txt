{probability: 0.46, The base rate of people 185 cm or taller who are attackers is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies height in 80% of cases, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, there's also a chance that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Since the base rate of shorter people who are attackers is 0.85, and the witness makes an error in 20% of cases, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.46.}
