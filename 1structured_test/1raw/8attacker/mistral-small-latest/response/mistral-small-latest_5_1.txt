{probability: 0.33, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually that height is 0.8. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = approximately 0.33.}
