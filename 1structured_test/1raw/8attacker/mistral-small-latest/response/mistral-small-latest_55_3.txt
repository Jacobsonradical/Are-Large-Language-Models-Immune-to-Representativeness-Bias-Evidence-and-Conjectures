{probability: 0.27, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We know P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller), and P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.23. So, P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 = 0.27.}
