{probability: 0.325, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability of the witness correctly identifying the height regardless of the actual height is 0.5*0.8 + 0.5*0.2 = 0.5. So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.5 = 0.325.}
