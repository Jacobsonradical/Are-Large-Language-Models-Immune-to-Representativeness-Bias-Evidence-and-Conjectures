{probability: 0.54, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) with the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height under similar conditions (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then we add this to the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.10, calculated as 0.5 * 0.2), which gives a total probability of approximately 0.54.}
