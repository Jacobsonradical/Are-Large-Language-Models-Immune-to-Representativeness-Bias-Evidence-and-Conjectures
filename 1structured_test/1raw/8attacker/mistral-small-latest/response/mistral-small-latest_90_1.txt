{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, since the witness also makes errors, there's a chance that they misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10. So, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.36.}
