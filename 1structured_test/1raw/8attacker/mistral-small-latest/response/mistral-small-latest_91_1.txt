{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the base probability for the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also misidentifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Since there are roughly equal numbers of people shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (correct identification) + 0.1 (incorrect identification) = 0.58.}
