{probability: 0.36,
Explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (this is the error rate when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Since the population of people shorter and taller than 185 cm is roughly equal, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.36}
