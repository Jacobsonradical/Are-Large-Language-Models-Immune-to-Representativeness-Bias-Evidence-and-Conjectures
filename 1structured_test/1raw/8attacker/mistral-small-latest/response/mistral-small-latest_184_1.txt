{probability: 0.37, given the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attacker heights}

Here's the reasoning:
1. Let's assume the total population of potential attackers is 100, with 50 under 185 cm and 50 185 cm or taller.
2. According to information "b", 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm (0.85 * 50 = 42.5 ≈ 43), and 15% are 185 cm or taller (0.15 * 50 = 7.5 ≈ 8).
3. Given the witness's accuracy in "a", the witness would identify approximately 80% of the 8 tall attackers correctly (0.8 * 8 = 6.4 ≈ 6).
4. Since the witness did identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we can infer that the attacker is likely among the 6 correctly identified tall individuals.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is 6/13 ≈ 0.37 or 37%.
