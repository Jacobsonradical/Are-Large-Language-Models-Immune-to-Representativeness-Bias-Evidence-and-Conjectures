{probability: 0.42, To arrive at this estimate, we first need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to information a. Then, we need to account for the witness's accuracy rate. The witness is correct 80% of the time with a 50-50 split of heights in the sample. However, in the actual population of attackers, only 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, if the witness is correct, they are more likely to have identified a shorter attacker as taller than vice versa. To account for this, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller: 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. This is the probability that the witness correctly identified a taller attacker. Since the witness did identify the attacker as taller, we can take this as our final estimate: 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.20 * 0.85) = approximately 0.42.}
