{probability: 0.249,

Explanation: Let's use Bayes' theorem to combine the information provided.

1. First, we have the witness accuracy: 80% chance of correct identification and 20% chance of mistake.
2. Second, we know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W)

We have P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W), we use the law of total probability:

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

Since the population is roughly equal in size for people under and over 185 cm, P(not A) ≈ 0.85.

We also know that P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging these values in, we get:

P(W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.22

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 ≈ 0.249

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.249.}
