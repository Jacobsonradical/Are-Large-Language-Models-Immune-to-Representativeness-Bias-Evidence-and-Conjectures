{probability: 0.34, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed that tall, is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.34.}
