{probability: 0.33, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the attacker is chosen at random from the population of attackers, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness correct identification is 0.8 if the attacker is 185 cm or taller. So, the posterior probability is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.33.}
