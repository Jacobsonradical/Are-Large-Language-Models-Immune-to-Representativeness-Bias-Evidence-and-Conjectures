{probability: 0.32, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), with the likelihood of the witness making a correct identification given the attacker's height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, which is approximately 0.32 when considering the witness's error rate of 20%.}
