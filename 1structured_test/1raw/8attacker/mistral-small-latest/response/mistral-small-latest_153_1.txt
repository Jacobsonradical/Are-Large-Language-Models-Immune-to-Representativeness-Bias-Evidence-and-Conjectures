{probability: 0.38, explanation: Given the witness's ability to correctly identify height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such is (true positives) / (true positives + false positives) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2*0.85) = 0.38. This is based on the assumption that the attacker's height follows the same distribution as the general population, which may not be accurate.}
