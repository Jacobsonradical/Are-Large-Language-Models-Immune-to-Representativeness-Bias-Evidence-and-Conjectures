{probability: 0.45, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying an attacker of this height is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability, or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.45.}
