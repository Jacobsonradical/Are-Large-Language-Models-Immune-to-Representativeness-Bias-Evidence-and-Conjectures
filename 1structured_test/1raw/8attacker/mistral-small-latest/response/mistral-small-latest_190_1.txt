{probability: 0.23, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we have a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, so we need to account for the witness's reliability. The witness has an 80% chance of identifying height correctly. Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, this is the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness said so). P(Witness said so) = P(Witness said so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness said so | Attacker is under 185 cm) * P(Attacker is under 185 cm). Since the witness has a 20% error rate, P(Witness said so | Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.2. Given the population distribution, P(Attacker is under 185 cm) = 0.85. Substituting these values, we get P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness said so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.23.}
