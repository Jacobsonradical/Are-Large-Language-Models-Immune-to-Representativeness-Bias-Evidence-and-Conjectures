{probability: 0.54, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying such individuals (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Then, we add this to the witness's error rate in identifying shorter individuals as being 185 cm or taller (0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1). So, 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.54.}
