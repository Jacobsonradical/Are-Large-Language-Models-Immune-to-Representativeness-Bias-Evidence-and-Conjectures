{probability: 0.46, explanation: Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution of attackers, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from b). The likelihood of the witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from a). The probability of the witness's observation regardless of the attacker's height is 0.5 (since half the population is 185 cm or taller). So, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.5) = 0.46.}
