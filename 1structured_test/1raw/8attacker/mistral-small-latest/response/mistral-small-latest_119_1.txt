{probability: 0.43, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The witness's accuracy is 0.8 (from information a). The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = approximately 0.43.}
