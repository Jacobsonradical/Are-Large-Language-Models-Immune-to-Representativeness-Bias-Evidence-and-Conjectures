{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.15) that an attacker is 185 cm or taller with the likelihood that the witness is correct when identifying a person of that height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. So, we multiply the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) with the likelihood that the witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller (0.2). So, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.56 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
