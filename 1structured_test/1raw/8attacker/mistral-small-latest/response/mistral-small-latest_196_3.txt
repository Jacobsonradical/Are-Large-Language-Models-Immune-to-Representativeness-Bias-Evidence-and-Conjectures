{probability: 0.51, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in information b). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given in information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.51.}
