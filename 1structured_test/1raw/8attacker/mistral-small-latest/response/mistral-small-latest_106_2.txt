{probability: 0.51, The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.51. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height of a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), which gives us a total probability of approximately 0.51.}
