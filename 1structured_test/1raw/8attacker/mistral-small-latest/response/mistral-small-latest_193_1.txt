{probability: 0.265, Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information, we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be calculated using total probability theorem: P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A), where P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.265.}
