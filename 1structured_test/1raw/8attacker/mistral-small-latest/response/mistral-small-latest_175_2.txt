{probability: 0.26, This estimate is calculated by combining the witness's accuracy in identifying height (80%) with the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (15%). So, the probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 for the witness being correct that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 for the witness being wrong and the attacker actually being shorter. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.16) = 0.26.}
