Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From the information:
P(A) = 0.15 (since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the witness made an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values: P(A|B) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.3

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3.
