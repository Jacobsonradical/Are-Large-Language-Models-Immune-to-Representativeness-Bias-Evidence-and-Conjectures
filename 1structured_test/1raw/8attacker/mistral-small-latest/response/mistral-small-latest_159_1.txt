{probability: 0.36,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, and we also know that among attackers, 15% are 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.80 (witness's accuracy) * 0.15 (proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller) = 0.12.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error and identified a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.20 (witness's error rate) * 0.85 (proportion of attackers who are shorter) = 0.17.

So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.36.
