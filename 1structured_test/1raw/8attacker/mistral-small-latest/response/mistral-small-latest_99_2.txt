{probability: 0.27, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness's likelihood of being correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, the posterior probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, given the question asks for the attacker being identified as 185 cm or taller, we also need to account for the false positives. The witness's likelihood of being incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. And the prior probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.85. So, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the witness and the given information, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.27 or 27%.}
