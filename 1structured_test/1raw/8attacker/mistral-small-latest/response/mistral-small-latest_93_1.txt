{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, there's only a 15% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness correctly identified a taller attacker when one was present is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as taller. Since the population of shorter and taller people is roughly equal, the probability of a shorter attacker being present is 0.5. Therefore, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 (witness correctly identified taller attacker) + 0.1 (witness incorrectly identified shorter attacker) = 0.36.}
