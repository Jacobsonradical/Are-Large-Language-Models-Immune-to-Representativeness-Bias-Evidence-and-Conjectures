{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying such heights, the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness made an identification, we need to account for this in our calculation. This is a case of conditional probability. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.2*0.5) = 0.36, where 0.2 is the error rate and 0.5 is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.}
