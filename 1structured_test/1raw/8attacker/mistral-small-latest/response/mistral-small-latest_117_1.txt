{probability: 0.36,

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. We have a witness who correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time.
2. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we know that 85% of such attackers are people under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
4. Given that the witness makes a mistake in 20% of cases, there is a chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness identified otherwise.
5. So, to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the witness's error rate.
6. If we assume that the total population of attackers is 100 people for simplicity, then 85 of them are shorter than 185 cm, and 15 are 185 cm or taller.
7. The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. So, we are interested in the probability that this identification is correct.
8. Out of the 15 actual attackers who are 185 cm or taller, the witness will correctly identify them 80% of the time, which is 0.8 * 15 = 12.
9. However, the witness may also incorrectly identify some of the shorter attackers as being 185 cm or taller. There are 85 shorter attackers, and the witness will make a mistake in 20% of these cases, which is 0.2 * 85 = 17.
10. So, out of the 12 attackers correctly identified as 185 cm or taller and the 17 shorter attackers mistakenly identified as such, a total of 29 attackers were identified as being 185 cm or taller.
11. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 12 (correctly identified) / 29 (total identified) = 0.36 or 36%.
