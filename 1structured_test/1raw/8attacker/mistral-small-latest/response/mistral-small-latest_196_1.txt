{probability: 0.33, The witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height applies to both groups (those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller). However, given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for this. The probability is calculated as follows: 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.80 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%. But we also need to account for the witness's errors. The witness could have incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This happens 20% of the time for the 85% of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm. So, 0.85 (probability of an attacker being shorter) * 0.20 (witness's error rate) = 0.17 or 17%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.33 or 33%.}
