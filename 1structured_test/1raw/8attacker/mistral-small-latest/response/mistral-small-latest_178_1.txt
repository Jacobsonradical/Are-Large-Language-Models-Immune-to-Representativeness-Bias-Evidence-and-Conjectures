{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time in similar conditions, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Since there's a 20% chance of the witness making an error, and the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to add the probability of the witness making an error when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.36.}
