{probability: 0.46,

Explanation:
Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, let's denote the probability of a random person having a height of 185 cm or taller as P(H).

From the information, we know that 85% of the attackers are people under 185 cm, and therefore 15% of the attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Height) = 0.15.

The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. So, P(Witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller | Person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witness makes errors in 20% of the cases when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, P(Witness identified as 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equations, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness identified as 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5)] = 0.46

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.46.}
