{probability: 0.68, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller, which is the base rate of attackers being shorter than 185 cm (0.85) multiplied by the witness error rate (0.2), which equals 0.17. So, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.68.}
