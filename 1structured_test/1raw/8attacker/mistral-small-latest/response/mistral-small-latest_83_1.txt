{probability: 0.42,
This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we have a prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm). Then, we have the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually this height, which is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time). We also have the likelihood of the witness making this identification given that the attacker is shorter, which is 0.1 (since half the population is shorter, and the witness makes errors 20% of the time). Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability, which is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.1)) = 0.42.}
