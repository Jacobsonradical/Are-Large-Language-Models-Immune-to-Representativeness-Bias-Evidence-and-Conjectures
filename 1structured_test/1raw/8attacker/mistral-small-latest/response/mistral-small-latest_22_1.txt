{probability: 0.47, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% * 80% = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness made an identification, we need to consider the probability of this happening given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is known as the positive predictive value (PPV). PPV = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives). In this case, true positives are 12% (15% of attackers * 80% accuracy) and false positives are 9% (50% of the population * 20% error rate * 15% of attackers). So, PPV = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.09) â‰ˆ 0.47 or 47%.}
