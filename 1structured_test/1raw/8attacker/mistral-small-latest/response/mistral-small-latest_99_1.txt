{probability: 0.28,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We want to find P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

From the information given, P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time).

P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% attackers are 185 cm or taller).

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, P(not A) = 0.85.

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the height of an attacker who is actually shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller. This is the error rate, which is 0.2.

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.28.

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.28.
