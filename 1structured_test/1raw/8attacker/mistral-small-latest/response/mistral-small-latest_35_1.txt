{probability: 0.32, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in information b). The likelihood of the witness's correct identification, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.80 (given in information a). So, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness made an incorrect identification of a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.85, and the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying such a person is 0.20. So, the probability of this error is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.32.}
