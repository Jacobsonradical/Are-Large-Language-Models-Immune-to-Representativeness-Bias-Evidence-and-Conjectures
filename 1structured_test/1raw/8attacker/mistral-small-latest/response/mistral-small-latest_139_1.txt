{probability: 0.47, given that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy, and the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population is 15%, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of making an error, so the estimated probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller despite the witness's error is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.47}
