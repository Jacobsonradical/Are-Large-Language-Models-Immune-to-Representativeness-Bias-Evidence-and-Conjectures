{probability: 0.263, given the witness's accuracy and the prevalence of attackers under 185 cm, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.263. This is calculated by multiplying the witness's accuracy in identifying taller people (0.80) by the proportion of taller attackers (0.15).}
