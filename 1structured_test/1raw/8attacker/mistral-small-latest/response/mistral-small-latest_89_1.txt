{probability: 0.54, This estimate is calculated by multiplying the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height given the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8), which results in 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.5 (since the population is equally divided) times the error rate of 0.2, which results in 0.1. So, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.54.}
