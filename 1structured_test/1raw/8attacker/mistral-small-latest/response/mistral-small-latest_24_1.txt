{probability: 0.39, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we start with a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made a mistake and identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter. Given that 20% of the time the witness makes an error, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.39.}
