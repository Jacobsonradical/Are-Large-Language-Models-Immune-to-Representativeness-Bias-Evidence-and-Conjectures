Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
P(A): The prior probability of A (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|A): The probability of W given A (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not A): The probability of W given not A (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A): The prior probability of not A (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

From the information:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|A) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W|not A) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))

We want to find P(A|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies the attacker as such.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given values:

P(A|W) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.29

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.29.

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
