{probability: 0.25, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. Given that the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying height, and only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. This results in a probability of approximately 0.25.}
