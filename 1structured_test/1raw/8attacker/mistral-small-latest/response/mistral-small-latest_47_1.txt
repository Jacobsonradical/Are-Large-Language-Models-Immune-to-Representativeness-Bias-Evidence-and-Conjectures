{probability: 0.43, based on Bayes' theorem and the given data}

Explanation:

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W: The event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A): Prior probability of A (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller before considering witness testimony) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(W|A): Likelihood of W given A (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from information a)
- P(W): Prior probability of W (overall probability that the witness identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller)

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|W), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identifies him as such.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

Since the population distribution is roughly equal, we can assume that the prior probability of an attacker being chosen at random is 0.5.

Let's find P(W) using the law of total probability:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
P(W|not A) represents the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter. This is equal to the error rate of the witness, which is 0.2 (20%).

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.24

Now, we can find P(A|W) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.24 ≈ 0.43

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.43.
