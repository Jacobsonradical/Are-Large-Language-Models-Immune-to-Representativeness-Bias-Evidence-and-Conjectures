{probability: 0.46, explanation: The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time for people who are 185 cm or taller), P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller), and P(B) = 0.5 (half of the sample is 185 cm or taller). Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), we get P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46.}
