{probability: 0.34, explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Let's use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness identified the attacker as such. We know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (from the information given), and P(not A) = 0.85. We also need to find P(B), which is the probability that the witness identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether they actually are. This can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Since P(B|not A) is the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter person as taller, which is 0.2, we get P(B) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.23. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.34.}
