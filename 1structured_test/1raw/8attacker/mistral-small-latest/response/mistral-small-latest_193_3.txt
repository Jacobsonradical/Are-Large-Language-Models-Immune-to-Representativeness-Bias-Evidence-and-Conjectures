{probability: 0.27, This is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.267 or approximately 0.27.}
