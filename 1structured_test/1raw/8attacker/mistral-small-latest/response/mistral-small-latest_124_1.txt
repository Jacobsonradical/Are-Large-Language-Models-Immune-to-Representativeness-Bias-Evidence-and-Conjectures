{probability: 0.54, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of taller attackers (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying their height (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as tall (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), which gives the final estimate of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.54.}
