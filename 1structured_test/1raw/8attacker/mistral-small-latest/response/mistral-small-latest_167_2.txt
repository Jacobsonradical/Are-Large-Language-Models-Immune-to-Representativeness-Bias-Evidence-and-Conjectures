{probability: 0.39, explanation: This is a problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B as the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

From information b, we know P(A) = 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller), and P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

From information a, we know P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)).

Substituting the given values, we get P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.39.}
