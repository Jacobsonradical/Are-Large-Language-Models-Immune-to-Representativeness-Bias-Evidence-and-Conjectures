{probability: 0.36,

Explanation: Let's break down the information given and calculate the probability step by step.

First, we know that the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time.

Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, we can assume that the witness saw the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 (80%).

However, we also know that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we need to apply this information to get the final probability.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is calculated as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says so)

We know P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy)
We know P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the attacker height distribution)

P(witness says so) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
P(witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the population is roughly equal, P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.
The witness makes an error 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, so P(witness says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:
P(witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

Substituting all these values into our initial probability equation, we get:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.}
