{probability: 0.58, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's probability of correctly identifying such a person's height (0.8), resulting in 0.12. Then, we divide this by the sum of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness misidentifying a shorter person as taller (0.15 * 0.2 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.21), which gives us approximately 0.58.}
