{probability: 0.24, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the witness would correctly identify them with a probability of 0.8. However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.24.}
