{probability: 0.35,

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80%, or 0.8.
2. Next, we need to consider the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this is 15%.
3. To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such, we can use Bayes' theorem. This gives us a probability of (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.35.
4. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.35.
