Explanation: Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and P(~A) be the probability that the attacker was shorter.
Given the information in b, P(A) = 0.15 and P(~A) = 0.85.

Let P(W|A) be the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. From information in a, P(W|A) = 0.8.
Let P(W|~A) be the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. This is also 0.2, since the witness erred in 20% of the cases.

What we want to find is P(A|W), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

By Bayes' theorem, P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / (P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
