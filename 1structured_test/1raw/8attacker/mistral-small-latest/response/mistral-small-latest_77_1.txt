{probability: 0.44, explanation: The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. First, we have a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on information (a). Then, we have the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8, according to information (b). Lastly, we have the probability of the witness making such a statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.8. So, using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.44.}
