{probability: 0.46, Given the witness's 80% accuracy and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, considering the prior probability distribution of attacker heights in the population, we should apply Bayes' theorem. If we assume the population distribution is roughly equal, then the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5. So, the posterior probability is (0.12 * 0.5) / ((0.12 * 0.5) + (0.20 * 0.85)) = 0.46.}
