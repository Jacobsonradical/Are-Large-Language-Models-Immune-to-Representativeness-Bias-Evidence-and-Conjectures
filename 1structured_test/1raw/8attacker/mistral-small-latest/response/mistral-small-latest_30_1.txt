{probability: 0.58, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.58. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying their height (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then we add this to the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this error occurring when the actual person is shorter is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58.}
