{probability: 0.27, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.27}

Explanation:
Using Bayes' theorem and the given information, we can calculate the probability as follows:
1. P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / [P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)]
2. P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that 15% of attackers are of this height: 0.15
3. P(W|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.8
4. P(W|not A) is the probability that the witness makes an error in identifying the height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: 0.2 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time)
5. P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 0.85
6. Plugging in the values, we get: P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.27
