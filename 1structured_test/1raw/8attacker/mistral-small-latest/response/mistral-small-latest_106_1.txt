{probability: 0.47, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy. Given that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller in the population, we can estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller by multiplying these two values together: 0.15 (probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%. However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error when identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the population of shorter attackers is roughly equal to the population of taller attackers, the probability of a shorter attacker being misidentified as taller is 0.5 (probability of a random attacker being shorter) * 0.2 (witness's error rate) = 0.1 or 10%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.47 or 47%.}
