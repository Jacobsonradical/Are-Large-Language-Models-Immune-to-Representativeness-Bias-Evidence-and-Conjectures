{probability: 0.58, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height under these conditions (0.8), which equals 0.12. Then, we divide this by the total probability of the witness's report, which is the sum of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker (0.15*0.8=0.12) and the witness mistakenly identifying a short attacker as tall (0.85*0.2=0.17), which equals 0.29. So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58.}
