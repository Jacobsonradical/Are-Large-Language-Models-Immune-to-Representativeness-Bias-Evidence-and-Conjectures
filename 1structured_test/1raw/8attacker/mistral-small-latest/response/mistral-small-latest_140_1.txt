{probability: 0.3025, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement is the product of the probability of the witness's correct identification (0.8) and the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), divided by the total probability of the witness's statement, which is the sum of the product of the probability of the witness's correct identification and the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the product of the probability of the witness's incorrect identification (0.2) and the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.85). So, (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.3025.}
