{probability: 0.36,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
2. We also know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, while only 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. Given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that this identification is correct, given the witness's accuracy and the distribution of attacker heights.
4. This is a conditional probability problem. Let's denote E as the event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and A as the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
5. We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
7. P(E|A) is the witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
8. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
9. To find P(E), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(E|A)*P(A)) and the attacker is shorter but the witness made an error (P(E|not A)*P(not A)).
10. P(not A) is 1 - P(A) = 85%. P(E|not A) is the witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter, which is also 20% or 0.2.
11. So, P(E) = P(E|A)*P(A) + P(E|not A)*P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
12. Therefore, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.36.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.}
