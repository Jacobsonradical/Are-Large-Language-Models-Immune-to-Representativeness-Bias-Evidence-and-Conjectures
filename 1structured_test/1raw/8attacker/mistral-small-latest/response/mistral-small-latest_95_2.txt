{probability: 0.52, This estimate is calculated by taking the 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller from the population statistics (a), and then multiplying it by the witness's accuracy rate of 80% in identifying taller individuals under similar conditions (b). So, 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) * 0.80 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12. Adding to this the 20% chance that the witness misidentified a shorter individual as taller (0.5 (probability of attacker being shorter) * 0.20 (witness's error rate) = 0.10), we get a total probability of 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.22. However, since this is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, or incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as such, we need to divide this by the total probability of the witness making any identification (accounting for correct and incorrect identifications). This total probability is the sum of the witness's accuracy (0.80) and error rate (0.20), which equals 1. So, the final estimate is 0.22 / 1 = 0.52.}
