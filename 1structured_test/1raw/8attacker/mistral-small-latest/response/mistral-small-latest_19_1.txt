{probability: 0.54,

Explanation:
Given the population distribution and the proportion of attackers, there is a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Taking into account the witness's accuracy, there is an 80% chance that the witness is correct when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as such) = P(witness is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

However, the witness could have also correctly identified an attacker who is actually 185 cm or taller, despite the fact that they are in the minority. This is a case of the witness being correct even though the odds are against it. The probability of this happening is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness is correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness identified as such) = 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.54

Therefore, the estimated probability is 0.54.
