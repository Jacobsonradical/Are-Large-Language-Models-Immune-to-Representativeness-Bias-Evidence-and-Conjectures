{probability: 0.52,

Here's the reasoning:

1. The witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of cases, and there's a 50% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 * 0.8 = 0.4.

2. However, the witness can also incorrectly identify a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. There's an 85% chance that the attacker is shorter, and a 20% chance that the witness will incorrectly identify a shorter person as taller. So the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

3. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.4 + 0.17 = 0.57.

4. However, we need to account for the witness's error rate in identifying height. The witness makes errors in 20% of cases, so we need to adjust our probability estimate downwards by this amount. So the final estimate is 0.57 * 0.8 = 0.456, or approximately 0.52 when rounded to two decimal places.
