{probability: 0.48, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.15) of an attacker being 185 cm or taller with the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.8), which gives us 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility of the witness making an error but the attacker still being 185 cm or taller. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.15) with the probability of the witness making an error (0.2), which gives us 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 or 0.48 when expressed as a decimal.}
