{probability: 0.56, This is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. Given the witness's accuracy rate, the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2) = 0.56.}
