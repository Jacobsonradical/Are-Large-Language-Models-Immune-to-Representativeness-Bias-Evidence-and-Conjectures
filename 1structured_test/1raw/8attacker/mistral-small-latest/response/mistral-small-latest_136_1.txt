{probability: 0.36, The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated by considering the population distribution and the witness's accuracy. Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, since the witness could also misidentify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller, we need to consider this possibility as well. Given that half the population is shorter than 185 cm and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of misidentifying a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.36.}
