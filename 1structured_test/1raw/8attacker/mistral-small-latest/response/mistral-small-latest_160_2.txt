{probability: 0.46, explanation: Given that the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller if the witness identified him as such. However, since only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust this probability. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.46 or 46%.}
