{probability: 0.34, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we first need to find the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. Then, we need to find the likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed this height, which is 80% or 0.8. Finally, we multiply these two values together and divide by the total probability of the witness's observation (which is the sum of the product of the prior probability and likelihood for both attacker height possibilities), resulting in approximately 0.34.}
