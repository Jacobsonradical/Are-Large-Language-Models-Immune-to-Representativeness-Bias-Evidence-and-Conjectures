{probability: 0.53, explanation: This is a Bayesian inference problem. Let's denote E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height. We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W).

From the information provided, P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in identifying people who are 185 cm or taller).

The population is roughly equally divided between people shorter and taller than 185 cm, so P(E) = 0.5.

However, we also know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, so P(not E) = 0.85. Therefore, P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E) = 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.68.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.5 / 0.68 â‰ˆ 0.53.}
