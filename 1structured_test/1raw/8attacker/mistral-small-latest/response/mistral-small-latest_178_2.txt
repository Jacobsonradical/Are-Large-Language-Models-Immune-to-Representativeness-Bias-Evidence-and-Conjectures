{probability: 0.44, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, considering the 20% error rate, we need to add the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since the population is equally divided between shorter and taller people, this error contributes an additional 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.10 to the estimate. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.44}
