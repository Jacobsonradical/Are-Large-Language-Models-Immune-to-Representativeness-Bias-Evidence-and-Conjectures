{probability: 0.32, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness making a correct identification given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.2, since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases). Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness identifying a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.32.}
