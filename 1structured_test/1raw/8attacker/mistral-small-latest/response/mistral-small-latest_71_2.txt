{probability: 0.56, given that there's an 85% chance the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and a 15% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the witness has an 80% accuracy for identifying taller individuals, so the probability of the attacker being taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller. Since the population of shorter people is equal to that of taller people, this error contributes an additional 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 to the probability. Therefore, the total probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.56.}
