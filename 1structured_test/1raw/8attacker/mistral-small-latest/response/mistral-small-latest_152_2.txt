{probability: 0.52, explanation: Given that the population is equally distributed between people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we can conclude that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. This is 0.20 (the error rate) times the proportion of shorter people in the population, which is 0.5. So, this probability is 0.20 * 0.5 = 0.10. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.10 = 0.52.}
