{probability: 0.26, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, there is a 15% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The witness's accuracy in identifying height is 80%, so the probability of the witness correctly identifying a taller person is 0.8. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.26.}
