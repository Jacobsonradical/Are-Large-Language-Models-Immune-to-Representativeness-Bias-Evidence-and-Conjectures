Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We know from information "a":
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

And from information "b":
P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.36.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.36}
