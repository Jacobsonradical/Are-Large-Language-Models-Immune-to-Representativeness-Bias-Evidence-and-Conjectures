Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote H as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W), the probability of H given W.

From the problem, we know that:
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the actual height is less than 185 cm)
- P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(H|W) = [P(W|H) * P(H)] / [P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|¬H) * P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values: P(H|W) ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.31

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.31.

Answer: {probability: 0.31}
