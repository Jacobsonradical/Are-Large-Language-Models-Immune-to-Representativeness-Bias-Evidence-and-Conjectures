{probability: 0.275, explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy and the 15% proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability as follows: 0.8 (witness accuracy) x 0.15 (proportion of tall attackers) = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness misidentified a shorter attacker as tall. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, and the witness has a 20% error rate, this means that 0.85 (proportion of short attackers) x 0.2 (witness error rate) = 0.17 of the times the attacker is actually shorter but identified as tall. Adding these two probabilities together gives us 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, rounded to 0.275 for three decimal places.}
