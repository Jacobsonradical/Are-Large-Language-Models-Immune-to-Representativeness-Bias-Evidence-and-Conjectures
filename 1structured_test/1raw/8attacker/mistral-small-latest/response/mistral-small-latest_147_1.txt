{probability: 0.46, explanation: Given information b, the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller in 80% of cases when the actual proportion of such people is 50%. However, we know from information a that the actual proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is only 15%. Applying Bayes' theorem, the updated probability is approximately 0.46.}
