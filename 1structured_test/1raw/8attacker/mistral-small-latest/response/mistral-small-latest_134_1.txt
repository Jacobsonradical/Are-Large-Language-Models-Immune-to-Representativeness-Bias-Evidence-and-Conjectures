{probability: 0.4, This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.15) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller with the likelihood that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8), which gives us 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness could have also incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability (0.5) that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with the likelihood (0.2) of the witness making an error, which gives us 0.1 or 10%. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.4 or 40% that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
