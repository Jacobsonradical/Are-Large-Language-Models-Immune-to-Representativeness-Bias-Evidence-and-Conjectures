{probability: 0.54, this is calculated by multiplying the base probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying such individuals (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, but since the witness was wrong in 20% of cases, we need to account for the possibility that the witness misidentified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. This is (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.1. So the total probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.54.}
