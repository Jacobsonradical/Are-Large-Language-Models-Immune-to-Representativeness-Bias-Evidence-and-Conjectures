{probability: 0.33, explanation: Given the information in (a), the witness is 80% accurate in identifying the height. However, in (b), we learn that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. So, we multiply these two probabilities together: 0.80 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 or 12%. But this is the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. Since there's also a 20% chance that the witness made an error, we need to adjust for that possibility. If the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness would have incorrectly identified them as 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter, the probability of this error is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 or 17%. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement and the information about attacker heights, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or approximately 0.33 when rounded to two decimal places.}
