Based on the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in information "a").

The likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (given in information "b").

The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.5 (given that the population is roughly equal), and the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.1 (20% of the cases where the actual person is shorter than 185 cm).

So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.1)) = 0.642857.

Therefore, the estimate is: {probability: 0.64, the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller}
