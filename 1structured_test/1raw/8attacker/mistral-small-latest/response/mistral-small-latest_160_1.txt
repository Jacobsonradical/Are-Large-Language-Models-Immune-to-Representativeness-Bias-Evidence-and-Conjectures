{probability: 0.37,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first consider the witness's accuracy in identifying height. In a population where half are 185 cm or taller and half are shorter, the witness correctly identifies the tall people 80% of the time.
2. However, we also know that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm. This means that even if the witness is looking at a tall person, there's a higher probability that the person is not an attacker.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such. Let P(T|W) be this probability, where T is the event that the attacker is tall and W is the event that the witness identified the attacker as tall.
4. We know P(W|T) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(T) = 0.15 (the proportion of tall attackers), and P(W) = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2 = 0.23 (the probability that the witness identifies any random attacker as tall).
5. Plugging these into Bayes' theorem, we get P(T|W) = P(W|T) * P(T) / P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.37.
6. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.37.
