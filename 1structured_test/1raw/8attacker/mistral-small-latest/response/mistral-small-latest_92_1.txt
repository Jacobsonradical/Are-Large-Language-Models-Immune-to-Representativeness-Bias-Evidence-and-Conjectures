{probability: 0.41, Given the information that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height correctly, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.41 or 41%.}
