{probability: 0.25, This is calculated by considering the probability of the witness being correct given the attacker's height (0.8 for a taller attacker), and the base rate of taller attackers (0.15). Multiplying these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 for the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, the question asks for the probability that the attacker was taller given that the witness identified the attacker as taller. To calculate this, we need to consider the probability of the witness being correct for both taller and shorter attackers, and the base rates of these two groups. This gives us a probability of 0.25.}
