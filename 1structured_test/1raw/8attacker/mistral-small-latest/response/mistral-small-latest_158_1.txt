{probability: 0.42, This estimate is calculated by first considering the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. Then, we consider the witness's accuracy in identifying height, which is 80% or 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is the product of these two probabilities, which is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of misidentifying a shorter person as taller. Since the population of shorter and taller people is equal, the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter person is 20% * 0.5 = 0.1. Adding these probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.42 or 42%.}
