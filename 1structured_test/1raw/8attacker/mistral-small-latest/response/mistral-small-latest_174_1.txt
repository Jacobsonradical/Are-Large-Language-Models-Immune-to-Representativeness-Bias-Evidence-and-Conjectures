{probability: 0.29, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the witness correctly identifies a person of 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability that the witness misidentified a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. The likelihood of this is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). The prior probability of a shorter attacker is 0.85. Therefore, the posterior probability of this scenario is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
