{probability: 0.28, The witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Given their accuracy of 80%, we can adjust this probability for the fact that most attackers are actually shorter. 80% of the time the witness is correct means 20% of the time they are incorrect for those who are actually shorter. Since 85% of attackers are shorter, this means the witness incorrectly identified 0.85*0.20 = 0.17 of the attackers as being taller. So, the actual probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 - 0.17 = 0.28.}
