{probability: 0.30, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and the witness correctly identifies height in 80% of cases, we can assume that the witness is more likely to identify an attacker as shorter than 185 cm if they are indeed shorter. However, since the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability of this happening despite the majority of attackers being shorter. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We are looking for P(A|B). P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller), and P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.23. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.30.}
