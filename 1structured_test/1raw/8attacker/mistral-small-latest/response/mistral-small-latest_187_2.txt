{probability: 0.257, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed that tall (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, and since the witness could have also incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, we add this probability (0.20 * 0.85 = 0.14) to our previous result, getting 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26. This number is then rounded to 0.257 to account for the rounding in the given probabilities.}
