{probability: 0.41, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statement is calculated as follows: P(attacker >= 185 cm | witness statement) = P(witness statement | attacker >= 185 cm) * P(attacker >= 185 cm) / P(witness statement). We know P(witness statement | attacker >= 185 cm) = 0.8, P(attacker >= 185 cm) = 0.15, and P(attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85. P(witness statement) is the probability that the witness makes a statement regardless of the attacker's height, which can be calculated as P(witness statement) = P(witness statement | attacker >= 185 cm) * P(attacker >= 185 cm) + P(witness statement | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get P(attacker >= 185 cm | witness statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3 = 0.41.}
