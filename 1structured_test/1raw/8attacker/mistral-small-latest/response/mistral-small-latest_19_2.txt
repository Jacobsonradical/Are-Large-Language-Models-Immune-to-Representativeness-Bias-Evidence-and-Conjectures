{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness has an 80% accuracy rate for identifying people of this height, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated as 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness making an error when identifying a shorter attacker. Since the population is equally divided between shorter and taller people, the probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.5. Given the witness's 20% error rate for shorter people, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58 or 58%.}
