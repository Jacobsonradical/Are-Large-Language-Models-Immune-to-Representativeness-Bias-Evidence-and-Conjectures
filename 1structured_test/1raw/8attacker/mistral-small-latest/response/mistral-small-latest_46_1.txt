{probability: 0.42, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we start with a base probability of 0.15 for the attacker being 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so there's an 80% chance they correctly identified the attacker's height. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.42 or 42%.}
