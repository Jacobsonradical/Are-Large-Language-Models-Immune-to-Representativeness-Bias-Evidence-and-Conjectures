{probability: 0.31, calculation: Given the witness's accuracy of 80% and the fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker was identified correctly as being 185 cm or taller is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of attackers are shorter, the probability of this is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.31.}
