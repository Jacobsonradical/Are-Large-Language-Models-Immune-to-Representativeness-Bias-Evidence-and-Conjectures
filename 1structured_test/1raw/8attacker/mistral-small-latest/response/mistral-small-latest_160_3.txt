{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the base rate for our attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Applying Bayes' theorem, we get: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.36}
