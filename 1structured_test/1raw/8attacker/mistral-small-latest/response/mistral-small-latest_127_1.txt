{probability: 0.58, The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller with an estimated probability of 0.58. This is calculated by multiplying the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) with the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the height (0.8), which gives us 0.12. Then, we divide this by the sum of the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the height of a shorter attacker (0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68) and the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the height of a taller attacker (0.12), which gives us 0.58.}
