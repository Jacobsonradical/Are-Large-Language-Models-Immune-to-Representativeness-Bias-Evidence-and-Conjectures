{probability: 0.35, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. Given the witness's accuracy rate of 80% and the fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility of the witness making an error when identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This error rate is 0.20, and since 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this error occurring is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.35.}
