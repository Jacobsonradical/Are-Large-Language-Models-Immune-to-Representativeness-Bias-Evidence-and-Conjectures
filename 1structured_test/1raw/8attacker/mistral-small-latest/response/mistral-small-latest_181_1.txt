{probability: 0.30,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
2. Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of such attackers are 185 cm or taller. This reduces our prior probability to 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075.
4. Since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, we multiply the corrected prior probability by 0.8, which gives us a posterior probability of 0.075 * 0.8 = 0.06.
5. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error and identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller even though they were not. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness making this error is 0.85 * 0.2 (the error rate) = 0.17.
6. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, accounting for both the witness's correct identification and error, is 0.06 + 0.17 = 0.23.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.30 (rounded to the nearest two decimal places).}
