{probability: 0.58, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability of the witness correctly identifying such a person's height (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), which gives a total probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58.}
