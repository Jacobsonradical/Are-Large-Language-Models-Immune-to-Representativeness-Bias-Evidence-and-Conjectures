{probability: 0.44,

Explanation:
Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, this is our initial probability.
The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so we multiply this probability by the initial probability to get 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
However, the witness also makes mistakes 20% of the time. Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm is equal to those 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.
Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.44.
