{probability: 0.26, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem, where the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's identification is equal to the probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (0.8) times the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), divided by the total probability of the witness's identification, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witness correctly identifying a taller attacker and incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker (0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85).}
