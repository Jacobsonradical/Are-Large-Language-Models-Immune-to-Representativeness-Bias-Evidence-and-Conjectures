{probability: 0.54, This is calculated by taking the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), multiplying it by the probability of the witness correctly identifying a taller person's height (0.8), and then adding the probability of the witness misidentifying a shorter person as taller (0.1 * 0.2).}
