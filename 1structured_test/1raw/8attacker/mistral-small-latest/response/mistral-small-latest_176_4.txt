{probability: 0.52, explanation: Given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy, we can estimate the probability. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (as per information "a"). Given the witness's accuracy, the probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller is 80%. So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability of the witness mistakenly identifying a shorter person as taller. This is 0.5 (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate) = 0.1. So, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.52.}
