{probability: 0.36, Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller and the witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying height under similar conditions, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, since the witness identified the attacker as such, we need to consider the witness's error rate. So, the probability of a correct identification when the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability of an incorrect identification when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 * 0.5 (since half the population is shorter). Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's identification, is 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1) = 0.36 or 36%.}
