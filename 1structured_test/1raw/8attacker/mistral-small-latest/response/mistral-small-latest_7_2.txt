Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

First, we need to find the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

Next, we need to find the probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying taller individuals, which is 80% or 0.8.

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Likelihood) / Prior probability * Likelihood + (1 - Prior probability) * (1 - Likelihood)

Substituting the values:

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)

After calculating, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.32.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.32}
