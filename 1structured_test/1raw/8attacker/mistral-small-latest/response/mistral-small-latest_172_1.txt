{probability: 0.48, This is calculated by combining the two pieces of information. First, the witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the height. Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy) * 0.15 (percentage of tall attackers) = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of misidentifying a shorter attacker as tall. Given that 85% of attackers are shorter than 185 cm, the estimated probability of this error is 0.2 (witness error rate) * 0.85 (percentage of short attackers) = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.48 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
