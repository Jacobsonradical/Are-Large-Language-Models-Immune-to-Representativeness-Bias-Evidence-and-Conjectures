{probability: 0.27, explanation: Given that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm and only 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.2692 or approximately 0.27.}
