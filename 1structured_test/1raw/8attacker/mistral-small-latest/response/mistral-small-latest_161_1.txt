{probability: 0.36, Given that the population is equally split between those under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, it means that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (despite the witness's identification) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in identifying a shorter person as taller. The probability of this is 0.5 (since half the population is shorter) * 0.2 (the witness's error rate) = 0.1. So, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.36.}
