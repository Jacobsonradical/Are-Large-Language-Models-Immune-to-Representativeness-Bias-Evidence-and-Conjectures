{probability: 0.44,
The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is calculated as follows:
1. The population is evenly split between people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller.
2. 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability is 0.15.
3. The witness has an 80% chance of accurately identifying the attacker's height and a 20% chance of making an error.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is:
   P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness) = [P(witness | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / P(witness)
5. P(witness) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   P(witness) = P(witness | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(witness | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm)
6. P(witness | attacker < 185 cm) is the error rate of the witness, which is 0.20. Since the population is evenly split, P(attacker < 185 cm) is 0.50.
7. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
   P(witness) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.50 = 0.18 + 0.10 = 0.28
8. Finally, substituting these values into the equation for P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness), we get:
   P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | witness) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 ≈ 0.44

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.44.}
