{probability: 0.238,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We are given the witness's accuracy (80%) and the distribution of attackers' heights (15% are 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W as the event that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(E|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(E|W) = P(W|E) * P(E) / P(W)

We know P(W|E) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), and P(E) = 0.15 (the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is shorter.

P(W) = P(W|E) * P(E) + P(W|not E) * P(not E)

We know P(not E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85.

P(W|not E) is the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which is the witness's error rate: 0.2.

So, P(W) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Therefore, P(E|W) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.238.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.238.}
