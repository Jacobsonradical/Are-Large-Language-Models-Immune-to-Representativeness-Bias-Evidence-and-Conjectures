{probability: 0.58,
Explanation: Given the population distribution, there's a 15% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified a taller attacker is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, the witness could also have incorrectly identified a shorter attacker as taller. There's a 50% chance the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and a 20% chance the witness makes an error, so the probability of this happening is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

Adding these probabilities together gives us a final estimate of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58, or 58%.}
