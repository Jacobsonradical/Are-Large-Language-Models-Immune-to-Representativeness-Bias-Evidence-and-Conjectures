{probability: 0.36, explanation: Given that the population is roughly equal between people under 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, the base rate for an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness identifying the attacker correctly, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness made an error. The probability of the witness making an error is 0.2 (20%), and if the attacker is actually under 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying them as 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (since half the population is under 185 cm). Therefore, the probability of the witness making this error and the attacker actually being under 185 cm is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the final estimate: 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.36.}
