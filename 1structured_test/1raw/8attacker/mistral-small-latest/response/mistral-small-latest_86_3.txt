{probability: 0.38, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the likelihood of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given he is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15*0.8)/(0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.38.}
