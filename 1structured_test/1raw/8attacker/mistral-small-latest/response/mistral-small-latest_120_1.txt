{probability: 0.27, The witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height and the fact that only 15% of attackers are usually 185 cm or taller suggests that the probability is lower than one might initially expect. Using Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.27.}
