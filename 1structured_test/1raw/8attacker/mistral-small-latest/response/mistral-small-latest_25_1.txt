{probability: 0.25,

Explanation: Given the information, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of attackers are shorter, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities of the attacker's height:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal, P(not A) = 0.85.
And since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.25}
