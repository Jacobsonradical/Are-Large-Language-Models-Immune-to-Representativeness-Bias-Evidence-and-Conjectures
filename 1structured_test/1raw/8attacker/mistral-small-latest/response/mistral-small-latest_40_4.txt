{probability: 0.38, explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height and the fact that only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability as follows: 0.15 (base rate of attackers 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness's accuracy) = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the 20% error rate where the witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. So, we add 0.85 (base rate of attackers shorter than 185 cm) * 0.2 (error rate) = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.38.}
