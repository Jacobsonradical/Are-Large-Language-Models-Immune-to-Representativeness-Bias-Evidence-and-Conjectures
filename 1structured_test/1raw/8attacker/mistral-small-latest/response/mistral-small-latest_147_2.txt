{probability: 0.38, given the data, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.38. This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy in identifying such individuals (0.80), which gives 0.12. Divide this by the total probability of the witness making a correct identification, which is the sum of the witness's accuracy in identifying both shorter and taller individuals (0.12 + 0.40 = 0.32). So, 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.38}
