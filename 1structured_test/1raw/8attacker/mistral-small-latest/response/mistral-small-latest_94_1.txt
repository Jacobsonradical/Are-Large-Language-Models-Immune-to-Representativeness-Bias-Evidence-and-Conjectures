{probability: 0.44, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the accuracy of the witness in identifying such individuals (0.8), which gives 0.12. Then, we add this to the probability of the witness misidentifying an attacker who is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1), which gives a total probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.44.}
