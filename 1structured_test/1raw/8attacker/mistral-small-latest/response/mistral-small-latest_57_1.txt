{probability: 0.34, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given by information b). The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given by information a). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified him as such, is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.34.}
