{probability: 0.56, This is calculated by multiplying the base rate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate for identifying people of this height (0.8), resulting in 0.12, and then adding this to the witness's error rate for identifying shorter people as tall (0.1 * 0.2), resulting in a total estimate of 0.56.}
