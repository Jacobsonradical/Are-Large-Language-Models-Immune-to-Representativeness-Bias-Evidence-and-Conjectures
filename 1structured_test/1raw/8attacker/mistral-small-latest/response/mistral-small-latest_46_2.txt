{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that the population of people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm and taller is roughly equal in size, and that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, we start with a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified the attacker as such, is calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness says so)

P(witness says so) = P(witness says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says so | attacker is under 185 cm) * P(attacker is under 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.21 + 0.17 = 0.38

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.38 = approximately 0.56.}
