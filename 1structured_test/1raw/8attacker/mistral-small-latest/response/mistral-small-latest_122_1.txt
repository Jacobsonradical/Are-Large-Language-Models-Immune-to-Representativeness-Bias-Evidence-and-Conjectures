Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified him as such.

We know that:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 ≈ 0.24

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)

So, P(A|B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.24 ≈ 0.5

Therefore, my estimate is: {probability: 0.5}
