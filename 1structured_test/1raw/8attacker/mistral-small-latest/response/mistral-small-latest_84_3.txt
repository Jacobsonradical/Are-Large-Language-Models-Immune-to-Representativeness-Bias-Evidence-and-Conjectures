{probability: 0.27, explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying height, we can assume that the probability of correctly identifying an attacker of 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (since the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time). However, only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the product of these two probabilities: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. But we also need to consider the possibility that the witness made an error in their identification. Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time, and 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since the witness cannot possibly be more wrong than they are right, we cap the probability at the maximum likelihood of the witness being correct, which is 0.15. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.27.}
