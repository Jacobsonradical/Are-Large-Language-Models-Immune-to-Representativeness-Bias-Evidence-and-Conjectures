{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could have also wrongly identified a shorter person as tall. Since half the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, the probability of this mistake happening with a shorter person is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.58.}
