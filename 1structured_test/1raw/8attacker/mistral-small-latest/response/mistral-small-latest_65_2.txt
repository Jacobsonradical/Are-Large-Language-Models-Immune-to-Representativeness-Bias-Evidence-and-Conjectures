{probability: 0.41, explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We are given the witness's accuracy in identifying height (80% for 185 cm or taller) and the prevalence of attackers in the two height groups (85% under 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller). We can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such by using Bayes' theorem. The probability is approximately 0.41, or 41%.}
