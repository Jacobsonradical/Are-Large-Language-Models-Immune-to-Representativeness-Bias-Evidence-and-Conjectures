{probability: 0.49, Given the population distribution and the witness's accuracy, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.49 (assuming the witness's accuracy isn't influenced by the population distribution). This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the witness's accuracy for identifying such individuals (0.8), which gives 0.12. However, we also need to account for the witness incorrectly identifying shorter people as 185 cm or taller. This is calculated by multiplying the proportion of attackers who are shorter than 185 cm (0.85) by the witness's error rate for identifying such individuals as 185 cm or taller (0.2), which gives 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives the estimated probability of 0.49 (0.12 + 0.17).}
