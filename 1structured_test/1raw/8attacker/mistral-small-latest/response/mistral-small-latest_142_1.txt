{probability: 0.56,
Explanation: Given that the population is equally divided between people shorter than 185 cm and those 185 cm or taller, the initial probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.5 (50%).

However, we know that 85% of attackers are under 185 cm, so we need to adjust our probability based on the witness's testimony. The witness correctly identified height 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the witness is correct when they said the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

To find the final probability, we multiply the initial probability (0.5) by the witness's accuracy when identifying tall people (0.8), which gives us a probability of 0.56 or 56%.}
