{probability: 0.34,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability question. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as such.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identified height 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (only 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Since the population is roughly equal, P(not A) = 0.85.
And since the witness makes errors 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.34}
