{probability: 0.39, explanation: Given the witness's 80% accuracy in identifying heights and the fact that 15% of attackers are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the estimated probability. The witness would correctly identify the attacker's height if they are 185 cm or taller (true positive) with a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also incorrectly identify a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller (false positive). The probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. So, the total probability that the witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller is the sum of true positives and false positives: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.39.}
