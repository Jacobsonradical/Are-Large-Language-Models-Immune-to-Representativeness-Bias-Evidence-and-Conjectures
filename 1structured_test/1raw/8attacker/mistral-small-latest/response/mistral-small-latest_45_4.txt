{probability: 0.341, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.341. This is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem: P(tall|witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) / P(witness), where P(witness|tall) = 0.8, P(tall) = 0.15, and P(witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) + P(witness|short) * P(short) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29}
