{probability: 0.23, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The probability of the witness identifying the attacker as such, given that they are 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (from information a). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such, is 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2) = 0.23.}
