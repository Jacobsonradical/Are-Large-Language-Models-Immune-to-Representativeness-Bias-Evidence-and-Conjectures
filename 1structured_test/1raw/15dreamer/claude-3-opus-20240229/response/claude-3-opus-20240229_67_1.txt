Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer does not give us any information about his wife's classification.

Therefore, to determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, we should rely on the general population statistics provided. The study states that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are thus classified as "Nondreamers".

{probability: 0.2}
