Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. In other words, whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his wife's classification.

Therefore, to determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, we should rely on the general statistics provided about the population:

- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers"

Given this information, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
