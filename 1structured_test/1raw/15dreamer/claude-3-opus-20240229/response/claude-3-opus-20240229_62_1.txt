From the given information, we know that:
1. 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
2. A person's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not depend on their spouse's classification.

Since Brett's wife's classification is independent of Brett's classification, the probability that she is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
