From the given information, we know that:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- A spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
