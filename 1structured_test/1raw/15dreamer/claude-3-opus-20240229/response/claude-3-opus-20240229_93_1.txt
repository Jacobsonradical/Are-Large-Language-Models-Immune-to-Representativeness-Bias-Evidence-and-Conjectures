Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification.

Since the study found that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, regardless of Brett's classification.
