Based on the information provided in the question, the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his wife's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% in the question.

{probability: 0.2}
