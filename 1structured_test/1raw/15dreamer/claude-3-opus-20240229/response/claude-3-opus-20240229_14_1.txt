Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

In the general population, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification is independent of the other person's classification, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.
