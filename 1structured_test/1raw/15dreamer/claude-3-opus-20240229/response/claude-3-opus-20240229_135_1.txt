Based on the information provided, the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer, it does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should be the same as the general population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
