According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" based on their reporting.
- A spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's classification is independent of his own, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
