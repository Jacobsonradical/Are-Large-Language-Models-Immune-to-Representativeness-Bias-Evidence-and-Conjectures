According to the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

The study shows that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which means they are classified as "Nondreamers". Since the spouse's classification is independent, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
