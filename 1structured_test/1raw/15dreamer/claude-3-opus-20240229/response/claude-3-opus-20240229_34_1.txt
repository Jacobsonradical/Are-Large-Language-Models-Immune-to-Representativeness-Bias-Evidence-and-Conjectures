Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his wife's classification, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
