According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Given that the spouse's classification does not affect one's own classification, and Brett's wife is not influenced by Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability of her being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
