Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer does not give us any information about his wife's classification.

Since the study found that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), we can conclude that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
