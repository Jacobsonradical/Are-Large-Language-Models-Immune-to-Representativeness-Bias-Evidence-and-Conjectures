Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer does not give us any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
