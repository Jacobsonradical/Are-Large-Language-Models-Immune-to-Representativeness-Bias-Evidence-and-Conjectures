According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" based on their self-reported experiences.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer and the spouse's classification is independent of one's own classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.
