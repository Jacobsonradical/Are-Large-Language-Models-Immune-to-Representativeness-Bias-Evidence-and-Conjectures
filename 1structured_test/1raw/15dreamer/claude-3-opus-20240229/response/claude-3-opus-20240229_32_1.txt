Based on the information provided in the problem statement, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. In other words, whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
