According to the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing whether someone is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" does not help predict their spouse's classification.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are "Nondreamers"), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any randomly selected person, regardless of Brett's classification.
