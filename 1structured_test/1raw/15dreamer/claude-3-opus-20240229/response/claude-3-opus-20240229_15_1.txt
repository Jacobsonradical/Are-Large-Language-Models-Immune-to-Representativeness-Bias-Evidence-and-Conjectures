Based on the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming at least occasionally, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as either "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- A spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding his wife's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
