Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
