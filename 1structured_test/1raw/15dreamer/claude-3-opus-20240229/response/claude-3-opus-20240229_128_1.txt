According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming at least occasionally, while 20% claim they don't remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Since Brett's classification as a "Nondreamer" has no bearing on his wife's classification, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a "Nondreamer".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the percentage of people classified as "Nondreamers" in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
