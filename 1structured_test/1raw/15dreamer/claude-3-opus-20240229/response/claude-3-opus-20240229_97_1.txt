Based on the information provided in the question, the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, to determine the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, we should only consider the general population statistics provided in the question. The study states that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and these people are classified as "Nondreamers".
