From the information given, we know that:
1. 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
2. 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. A person's classification has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding his wife's classification, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
