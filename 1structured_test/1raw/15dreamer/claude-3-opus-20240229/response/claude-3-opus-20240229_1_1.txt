According to the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should be equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
