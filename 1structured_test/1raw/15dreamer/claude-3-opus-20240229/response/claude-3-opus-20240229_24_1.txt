According to the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not give us any additional information about his wife's classification.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.
