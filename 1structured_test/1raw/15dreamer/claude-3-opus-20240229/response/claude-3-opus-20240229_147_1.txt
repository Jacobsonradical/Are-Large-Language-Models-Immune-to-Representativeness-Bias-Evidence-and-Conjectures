Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. In other words, whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
