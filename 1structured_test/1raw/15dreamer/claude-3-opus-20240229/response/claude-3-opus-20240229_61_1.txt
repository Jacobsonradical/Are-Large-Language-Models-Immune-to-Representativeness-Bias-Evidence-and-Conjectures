Based on the information provided in the study, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers), the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
