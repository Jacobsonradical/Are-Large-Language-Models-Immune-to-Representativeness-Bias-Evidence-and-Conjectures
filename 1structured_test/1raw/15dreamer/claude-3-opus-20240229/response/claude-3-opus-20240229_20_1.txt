Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his wife's classification.

Since the study shows that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), and this percentage is independent of their spouse's classification, we can conclude that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
