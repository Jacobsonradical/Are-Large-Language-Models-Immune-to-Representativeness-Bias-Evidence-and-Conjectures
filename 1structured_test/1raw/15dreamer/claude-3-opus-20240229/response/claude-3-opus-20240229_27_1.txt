Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether a person is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent of their spouse's classification.

Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
