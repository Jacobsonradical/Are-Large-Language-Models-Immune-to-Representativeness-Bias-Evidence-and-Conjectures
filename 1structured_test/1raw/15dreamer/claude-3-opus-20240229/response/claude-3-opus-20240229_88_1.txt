Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer does not provide any information about his wife's classification.

Therefore, to determine the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, we should rely on the general statistics provided about the population:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Since Brett's wife is a random person from the population, her probability of being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
