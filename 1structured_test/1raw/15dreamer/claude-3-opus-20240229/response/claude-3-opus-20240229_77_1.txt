Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification.

Therefore, to determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we should rely on the overall percentages given in the question. It is stated that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are thus classified as "Nondreamers".

{probability: 0.2}
