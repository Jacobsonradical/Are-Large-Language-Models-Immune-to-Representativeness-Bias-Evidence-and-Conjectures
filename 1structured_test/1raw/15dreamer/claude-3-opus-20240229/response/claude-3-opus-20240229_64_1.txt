Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
