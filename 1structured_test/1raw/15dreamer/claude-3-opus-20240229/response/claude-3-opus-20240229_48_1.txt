Based on the information provided in the problem statement, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no effect on the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.
