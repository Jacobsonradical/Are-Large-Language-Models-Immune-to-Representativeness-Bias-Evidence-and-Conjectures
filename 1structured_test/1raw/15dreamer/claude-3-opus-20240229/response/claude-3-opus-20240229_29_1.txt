From the given information, we know that:
1. 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
2. 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. A person's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no predictive validity about his wife's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
