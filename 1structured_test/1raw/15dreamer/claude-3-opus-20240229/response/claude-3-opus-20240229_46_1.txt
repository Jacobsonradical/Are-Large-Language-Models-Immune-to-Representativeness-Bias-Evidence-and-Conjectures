Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification.

Therefore, to determine the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, we should only consider the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
