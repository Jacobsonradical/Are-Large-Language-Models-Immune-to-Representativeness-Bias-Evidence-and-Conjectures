Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether a person is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" does not depend on their spouse's classification.

Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a "Nondreamer".
