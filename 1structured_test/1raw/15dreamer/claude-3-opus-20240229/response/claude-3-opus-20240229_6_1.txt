According to the given information, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
