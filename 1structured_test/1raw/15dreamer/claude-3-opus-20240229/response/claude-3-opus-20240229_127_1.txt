According to the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Therefore, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% (or 0.2) in the problem statement.

{probability: 0.2}
