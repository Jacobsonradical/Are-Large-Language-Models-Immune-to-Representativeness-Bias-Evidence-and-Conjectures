According to the information provided:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" based on their self-reported dreaming experiences.
- The study found that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's classification is independent of his own, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
