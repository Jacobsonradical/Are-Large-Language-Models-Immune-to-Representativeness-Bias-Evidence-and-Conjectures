Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
