Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- A spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding his wife's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
