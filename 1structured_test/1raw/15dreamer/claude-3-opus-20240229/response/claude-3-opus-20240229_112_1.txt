Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
