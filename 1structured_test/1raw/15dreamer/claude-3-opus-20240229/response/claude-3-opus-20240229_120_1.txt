Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Therefore, to determine the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer, we should only consider the overall distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

The probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
