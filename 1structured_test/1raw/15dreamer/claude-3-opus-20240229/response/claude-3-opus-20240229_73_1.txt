According to the information provided:
1. 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
2. 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. A spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's classification is independent of his classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
