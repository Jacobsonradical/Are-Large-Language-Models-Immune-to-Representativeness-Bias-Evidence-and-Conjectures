According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- A person's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification.

Therefore, even though Brett is a Nondreamer, this information does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any randomly selected person, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
