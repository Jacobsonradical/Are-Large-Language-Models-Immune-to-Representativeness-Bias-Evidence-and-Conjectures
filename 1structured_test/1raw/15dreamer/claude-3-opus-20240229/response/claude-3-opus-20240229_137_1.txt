Based on the information provided in the question, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no influence on his wife's classification.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.
