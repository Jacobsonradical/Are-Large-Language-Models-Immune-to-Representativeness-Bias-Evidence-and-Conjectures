According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding his wife's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
