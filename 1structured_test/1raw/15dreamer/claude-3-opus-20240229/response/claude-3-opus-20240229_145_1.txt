Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer does not give us any additional information about his wife's dreaming classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
