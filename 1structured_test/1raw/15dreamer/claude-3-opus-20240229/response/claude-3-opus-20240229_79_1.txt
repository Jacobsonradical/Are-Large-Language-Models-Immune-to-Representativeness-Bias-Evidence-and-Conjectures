Based on the information provided in the study, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any randomly selected person from the population.
