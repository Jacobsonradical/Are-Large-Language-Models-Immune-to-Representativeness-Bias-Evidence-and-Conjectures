According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming at least occasionally, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- A person's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's classification is independent of his, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
