Probability: 0.2

Explanation: Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect his wife's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
