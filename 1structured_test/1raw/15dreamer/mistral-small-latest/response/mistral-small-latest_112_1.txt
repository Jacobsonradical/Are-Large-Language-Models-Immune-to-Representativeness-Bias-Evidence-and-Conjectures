Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can consider this as an independent event. Given that Brett is a Nondreamer (20% of the population), the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the overall population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
