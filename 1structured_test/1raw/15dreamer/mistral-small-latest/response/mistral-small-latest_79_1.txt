Based on the information provided, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not has no impact on his wife's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 0.2.
