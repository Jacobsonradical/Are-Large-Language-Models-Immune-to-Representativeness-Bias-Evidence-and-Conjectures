Probability: 0.2

Explanation: Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not influence his wife's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the overall population, which is 20% or 0.2.
