{probability: 0.2, assuming there is no correlation between individuals' dreaming habits beyond the spouse relationship}

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
