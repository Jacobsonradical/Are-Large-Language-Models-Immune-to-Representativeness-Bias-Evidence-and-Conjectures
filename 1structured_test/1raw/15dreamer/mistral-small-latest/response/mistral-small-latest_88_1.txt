Probability: 0.2

Explanation: Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect his wife's probability of being a Nondreamer. According to the study, 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming, so the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
