Probability: 0.2

Since the study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability remains the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers found in the study, which is 20% or 0.2.
