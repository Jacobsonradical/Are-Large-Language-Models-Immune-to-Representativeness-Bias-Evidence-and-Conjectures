Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is simply equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
