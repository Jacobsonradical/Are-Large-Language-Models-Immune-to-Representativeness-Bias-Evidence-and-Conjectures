Given the information provided, we know:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification.

Since spouses' classifications are independent:

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
