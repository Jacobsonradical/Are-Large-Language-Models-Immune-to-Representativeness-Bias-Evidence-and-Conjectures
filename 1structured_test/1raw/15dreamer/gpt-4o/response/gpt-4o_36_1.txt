Given that Brett is classified as a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

From the information given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers, which implies that 80% of people are Dreamers.
- The classification of an individual as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification.

The probability that Brettâ€™s wife is a Nondreamer is therefore simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

Hence, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
