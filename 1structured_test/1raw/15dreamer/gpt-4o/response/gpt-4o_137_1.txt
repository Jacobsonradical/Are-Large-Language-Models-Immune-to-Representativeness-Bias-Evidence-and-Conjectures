Given that the study has shown that one's classification about dreaming is independent of their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

According to the study, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability remains unaffected by Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.
