Given the information provided, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. This classification is independent of their spouse's classification regarding dreaming.

Since the study found that one's classification about dreaming has no predictive validity based on their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
