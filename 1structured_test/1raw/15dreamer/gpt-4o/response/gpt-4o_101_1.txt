Given that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer is independent of his wife's classification, we can simply use the overall probability that a person is a Nondreamer.

The study indicates that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer.
