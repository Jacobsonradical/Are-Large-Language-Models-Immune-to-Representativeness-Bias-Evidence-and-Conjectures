According to the information provided, there is no predictive validity regarding the classification of one's spouse about dreaming. This implies that the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his wife as either a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Given that the percentage of Nondreamers is 20%, we can infer that the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population percentage, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
