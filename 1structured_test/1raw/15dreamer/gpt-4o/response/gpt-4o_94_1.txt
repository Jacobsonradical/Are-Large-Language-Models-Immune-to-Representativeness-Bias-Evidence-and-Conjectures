Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, this means the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own classification as a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Thus, the probability Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the baseline probability in the population.

\[ \text{Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer} = 0.20 \]

{probability: 0.20}
