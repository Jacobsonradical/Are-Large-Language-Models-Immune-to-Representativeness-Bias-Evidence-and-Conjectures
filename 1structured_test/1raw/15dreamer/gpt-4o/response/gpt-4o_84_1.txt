Given the information, the probability that an individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20. Since the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer as well.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability for any individual being a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
