Based on the information provided, we know that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" for individuals occurs independently of their spouse's classification. This means that the classification of Brett's wife as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification as a "Nondreamer".

Given the overall population statistics:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"

The probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" would be the same as the general probability in the population. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
