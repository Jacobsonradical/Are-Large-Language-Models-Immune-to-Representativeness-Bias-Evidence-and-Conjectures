Given that the spouse's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

From the study, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
