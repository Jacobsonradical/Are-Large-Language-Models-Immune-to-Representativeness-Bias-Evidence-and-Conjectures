Based on the information given, the probability of any person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2. Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding Brett's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
