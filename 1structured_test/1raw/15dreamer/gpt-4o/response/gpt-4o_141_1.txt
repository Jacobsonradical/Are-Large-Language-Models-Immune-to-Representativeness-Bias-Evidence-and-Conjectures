Given that 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% as Nondreamers, and that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the classification of Brett's wife is independent of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%.

So, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
