Given that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between spouses, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the population.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
