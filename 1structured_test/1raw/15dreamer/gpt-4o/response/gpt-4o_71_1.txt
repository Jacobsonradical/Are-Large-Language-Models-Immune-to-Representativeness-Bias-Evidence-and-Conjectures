Given the information from the study, we know the overall distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population:

- 80% are Dreamers.
- 20% are Nondreamers.

The study also states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. This implies that the classifications of spouses are independent events.

So, if Brett is a Nondreamer, it doesn't affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The probability that any given person, including Brett's wife, is a Nondreamer remains at 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
