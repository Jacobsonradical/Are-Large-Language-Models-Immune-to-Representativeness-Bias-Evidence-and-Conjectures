To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information that people are classified as Dreamers or Nondreamers independently of their spouse's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer gives us no additional information about his wife's classification (as per the study's findings), we can still use the overall population distribution.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
