Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. 

The study states that the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This implies that Brett being a Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
