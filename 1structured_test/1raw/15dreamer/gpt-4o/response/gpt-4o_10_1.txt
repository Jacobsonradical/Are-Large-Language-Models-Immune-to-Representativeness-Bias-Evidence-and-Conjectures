To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information about the general prevalence of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population, and the fact that spouse's classification has no predictive validity.

According to the study:
- 80% of the population are Dreamers.
- 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Since the classification of one’s dreaming status has no predictive validity regarding their spouse’s classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen individual in the population is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability in the population.

Thus,

{probability: 0.20}
