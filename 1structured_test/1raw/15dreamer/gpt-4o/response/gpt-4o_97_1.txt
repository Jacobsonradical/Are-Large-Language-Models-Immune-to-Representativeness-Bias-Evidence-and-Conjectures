The classification of Brett as a Nondreamer is given, and since the study indicates that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, the classification of Brett's wife is independent of his classification.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would simply reflect the general probability in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
