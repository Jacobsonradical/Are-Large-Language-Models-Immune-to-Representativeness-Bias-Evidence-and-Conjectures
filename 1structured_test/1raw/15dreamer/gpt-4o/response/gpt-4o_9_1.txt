Given that the classifications of dreamers and nondreamers between spouses have no predictive validity, this implies that knowing one spouse's classification gives no information about the other spouse's classification.

Therefore, we treat the probabilities independently. Since 20% of people are nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a nondreamer in the population.
