Given that the classification of a spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, we can infer that the probability a person is a Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification. 

From the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer and his classification has no predictive effect on his wife's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as for any randomly chosen individual.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
