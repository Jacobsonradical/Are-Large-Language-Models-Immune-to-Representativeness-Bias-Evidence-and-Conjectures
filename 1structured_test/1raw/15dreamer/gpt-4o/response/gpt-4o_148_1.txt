Based on the information given, the classification of an individual as a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent of their spouse's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be the same as the overall probability in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
