Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, this means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

From the study, we know:
- 80% of people are Dreamers
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
