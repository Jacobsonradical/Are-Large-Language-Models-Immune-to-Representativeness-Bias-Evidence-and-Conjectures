Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the study, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.20}
