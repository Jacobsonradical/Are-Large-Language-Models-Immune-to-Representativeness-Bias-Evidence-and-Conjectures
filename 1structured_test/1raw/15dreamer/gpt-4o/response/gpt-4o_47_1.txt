Given that the classification of one person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification, we can assume that the probability distribution for Brett's wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is completely independent of Brett's classification.

From the data, we know:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are classified as Dreamers.

Therefore, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.
