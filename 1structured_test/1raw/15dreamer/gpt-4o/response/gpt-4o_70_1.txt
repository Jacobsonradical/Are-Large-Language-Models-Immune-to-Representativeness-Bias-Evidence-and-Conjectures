To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, given the information provided:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, Brett being a Nondreamer provides no additional information regarding his wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
