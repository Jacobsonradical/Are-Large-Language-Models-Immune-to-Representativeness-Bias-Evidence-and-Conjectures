Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we are asked to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. According to the study, the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer provides no additional information about the classification of his wife.

From the study, we know:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the spouse’s classification is independent of Brett's classification, the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore,
{probability: 0.2}
