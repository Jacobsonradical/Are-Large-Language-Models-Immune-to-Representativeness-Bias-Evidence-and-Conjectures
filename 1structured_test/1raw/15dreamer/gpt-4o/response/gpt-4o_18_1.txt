Given that being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent of one's spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equivalent to the general probability in the population.

According to the study mentioned, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
