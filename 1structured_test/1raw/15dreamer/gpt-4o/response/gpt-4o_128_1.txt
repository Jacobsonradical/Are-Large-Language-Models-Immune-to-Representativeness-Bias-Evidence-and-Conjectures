Given the information provided, we know the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the general population, with 20% being nondreamers. Additionally, we are informed that one spouse's classification as a dreamer or nondreamer has no predictive validity on the other's classification.

This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a nondreamer. Therefore, the probability remains the same as the proportion of nondreamers in the general population.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
