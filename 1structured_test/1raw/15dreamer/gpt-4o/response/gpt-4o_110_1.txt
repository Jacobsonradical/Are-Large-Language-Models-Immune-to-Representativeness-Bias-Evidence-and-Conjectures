Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer doesn't affect the classification of his wife. This is because the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the general probability of an individual being a Nondreamer.
