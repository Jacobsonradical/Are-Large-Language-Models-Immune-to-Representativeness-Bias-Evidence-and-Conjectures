Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. From the information provided, we know that 20% of people are Nondreamers and that the spouse’s classification has no predictive validity regarding one’s own classification.

Because the classification of one person has no predictive validity for their spouse’s classification, the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population. Therefore, the probability is 20%, or 0.2.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
