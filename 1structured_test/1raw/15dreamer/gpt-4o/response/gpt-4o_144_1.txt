Given that the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer provides no information about the classification of his spouse, we use the initial percentages given by the study for the entire population. 

According to the study:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the spouse's classification is independent of Brett's classification, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same 20%.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.2}
