Given that the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general probability in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
