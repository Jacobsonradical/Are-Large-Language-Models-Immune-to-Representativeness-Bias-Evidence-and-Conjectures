Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. According to the study, the spouse's classification on dreaming (being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer) has no predictive validity for the individual's classification. This means that knowing Brett's classification as a Nondreamer provides no additional information about his wife's classification. 

Given these independent probabilities:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the unconditional probability of someone being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
