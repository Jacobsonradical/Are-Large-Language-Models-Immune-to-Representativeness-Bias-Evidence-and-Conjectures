Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. According to the study, the classification of one spouse does not predict the classification of the other spouse. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

From the information provided in the study:

- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
