Given the information provided:

- 80% of people report that they dream, i.e., 0.80 are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, i.e., 0.20 are classified as Nondreamers.
- The classification of one spouse does not have predictive validity regarding the other spouse's classification.

Since the spouse's classification is independent of Brett's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
