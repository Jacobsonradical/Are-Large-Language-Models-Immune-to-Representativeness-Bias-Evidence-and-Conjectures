Given that Brett is a Nondreamer and that the study has found that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the general population. 

From the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
