To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given data.

The statement indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, meaning that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no additional information about his wife's dreaming classification. Therefore, the wife’s classification is independent of Brett’s classification.

Given that 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability of any individual, including Brett's wife, being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
