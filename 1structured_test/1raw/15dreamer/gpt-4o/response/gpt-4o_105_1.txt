Based on the information given:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding the person's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
