Given that the study indicates that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we are to calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer. The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification.

Therefore, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Hence, it is:

{probability: 0.2}
