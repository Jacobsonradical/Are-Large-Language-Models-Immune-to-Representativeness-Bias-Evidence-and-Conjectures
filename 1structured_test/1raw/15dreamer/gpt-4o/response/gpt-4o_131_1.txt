Based on the information provided, the classification of a person's dreaming status is independent of their spouse's classification. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be directly inferred from this overall statistic.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, which translates to a probability of 0.20.
