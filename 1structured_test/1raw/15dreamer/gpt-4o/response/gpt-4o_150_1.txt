Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

According to the study, 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. Additionally, the study specifies that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. This means the classification of one spouse does not influence the classification of the other spouse.

Therefore, since the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% (0.20), this is also the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

{probability: 0.20}
