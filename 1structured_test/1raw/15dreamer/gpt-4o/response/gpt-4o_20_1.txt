Given that 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers), this percentage applies to the general population independently of any spouse's classification. Since the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity on one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
