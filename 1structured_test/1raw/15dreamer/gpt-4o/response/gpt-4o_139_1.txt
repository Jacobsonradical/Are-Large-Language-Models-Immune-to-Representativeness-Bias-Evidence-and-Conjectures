Given the information provided, we know that the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since it is stated that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, this means that Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Hence, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
