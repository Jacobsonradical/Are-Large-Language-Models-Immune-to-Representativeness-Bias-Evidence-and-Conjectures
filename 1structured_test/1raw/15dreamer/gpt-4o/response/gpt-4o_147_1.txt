Given that the classification of a spouse has no predictive validity (i.e., they are independent events), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should equal the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

From the provided data, 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
