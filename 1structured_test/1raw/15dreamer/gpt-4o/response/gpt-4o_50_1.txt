Given the information in the study, the spouse's classification (i.e., whether they are a Dreamer or a Nondreamer) has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not impact the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
