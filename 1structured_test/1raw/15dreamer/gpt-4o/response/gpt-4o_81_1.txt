Given the information in the study, the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer provides the same distribution as the general population because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification. Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains consistent with the overall proportion in the population.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
