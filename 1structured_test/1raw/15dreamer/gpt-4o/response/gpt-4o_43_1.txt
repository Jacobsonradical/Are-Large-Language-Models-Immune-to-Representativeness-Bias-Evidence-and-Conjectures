Given the information that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers," and the fact that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probabilities are independent of each other.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, as the spouse's classification has no effect.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
