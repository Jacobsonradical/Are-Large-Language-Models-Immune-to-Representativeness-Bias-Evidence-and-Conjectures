Given that the classification of one spouse has no predictive validity regarding the other spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would be independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer would be equal to the overall probability of any randomly chosen person being a Nondreamer.

We know from the study that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. This can be expressed as a probability:

{probability: 0.2}
