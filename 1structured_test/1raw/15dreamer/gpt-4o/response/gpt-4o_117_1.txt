The study indicates that the classification of one as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification. This means we can look at the overall probability distribution among the population without regard to the spouse's classification.

Given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability his wife is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability in the population because independent events' probabilities do not change based on the outcomes of other independent events.

So, the probability Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
