Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can infer that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer has no effect on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

According to the study, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. This probability is independent of Brett's classification because his classification has no predictive validity for his wife's classification.

Hence, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
