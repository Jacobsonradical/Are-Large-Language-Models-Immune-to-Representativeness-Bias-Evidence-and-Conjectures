Given that the classification of Brett's wife as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification, we can use the overall statistics from the study.

The study states:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, irrespective of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.20}
