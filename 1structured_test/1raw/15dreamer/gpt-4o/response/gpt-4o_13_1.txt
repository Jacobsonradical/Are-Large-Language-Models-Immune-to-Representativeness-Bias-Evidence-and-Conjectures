The study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no additional information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brettâ€™s wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
