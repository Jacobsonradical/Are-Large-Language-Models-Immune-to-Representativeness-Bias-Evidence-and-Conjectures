Given the information provided:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, since the classifications are independent.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

{probability: 0.20}
