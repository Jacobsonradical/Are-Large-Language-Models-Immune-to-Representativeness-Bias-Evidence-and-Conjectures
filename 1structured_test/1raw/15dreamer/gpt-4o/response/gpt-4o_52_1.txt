Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. 

The study states that the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding their own classification about dreaming. This implies that the probabilities are independent of each other.

Knowing 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, regardless of their spouse's classification, we can deduce:

{probability: 0.2}
