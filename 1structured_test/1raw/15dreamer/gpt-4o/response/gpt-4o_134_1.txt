We know that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers". As the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
