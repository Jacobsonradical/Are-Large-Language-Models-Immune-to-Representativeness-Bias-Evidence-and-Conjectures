Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Since the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, this means the dreaming behavior of Brett and his wife are independent events. 

According to the study, 20% of people (or 0.2 probability) are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be given directly by the overall statistics for Nondreamers.

\[ \text{probability} = 0.2 \]

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
