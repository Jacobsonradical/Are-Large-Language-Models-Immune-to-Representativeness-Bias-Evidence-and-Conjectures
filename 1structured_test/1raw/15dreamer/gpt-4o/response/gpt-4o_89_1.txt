Given the information that dreaming status is independent between spouses, and that broadly 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer based solely on the general population statistics.

The probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is therefore the same as the overall probability for any person to be a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
