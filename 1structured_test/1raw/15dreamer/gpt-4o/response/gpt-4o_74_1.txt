Given that the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent of their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer.

Since it is given in the study that 20% of people are Nondreamers, we can use this information directly.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
