To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, the information provided in the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This implies that knowing one spouse's classification provides no useful information about the other spouse's classification, and therefore, the probabilities are independent of each other.

According to the study:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Given that the classification is independent of one another:

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability for any individual being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability:
{probability: 0.2}
