Given that the classification of one partner has no predictive validity regarding the classification of the other, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply equal to the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers:

\[ \text{Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer} = 0.20 \]

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
