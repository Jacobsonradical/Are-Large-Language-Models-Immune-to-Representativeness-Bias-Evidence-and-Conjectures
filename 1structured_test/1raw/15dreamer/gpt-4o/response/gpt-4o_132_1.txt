Given the information provided in the study:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

This implies that the probability of someone being a Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
