According to the study, the probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, meaning the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.
