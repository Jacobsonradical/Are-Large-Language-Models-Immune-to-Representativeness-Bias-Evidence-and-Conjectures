Given that studies have shown no predictive validity of one's classification (Dreamer or Nondreamer) based on their spouse's classification, the probability distribution for the wife's dreaming status should follow the general population distribution independently of Brett's status.

Based on the information provided:
- 80% of the population are Dreamers.
- 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer would simply be the population proportion of Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
