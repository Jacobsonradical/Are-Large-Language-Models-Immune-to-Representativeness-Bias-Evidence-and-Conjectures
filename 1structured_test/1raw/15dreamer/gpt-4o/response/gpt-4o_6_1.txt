Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, considering the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

The given data states that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and 80% are Dreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no relevance to Brett's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
