Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same irrespective of Brett's classification, because it is stated that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification.

Therefore,
\[ \text{Probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer} = 0.20 \]

So,
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.20} \} \]
