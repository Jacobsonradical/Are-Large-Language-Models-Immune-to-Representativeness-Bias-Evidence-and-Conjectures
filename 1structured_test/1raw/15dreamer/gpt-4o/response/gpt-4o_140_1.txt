Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can infer that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not change the general probabilities found in the study. 

From the study, we know that:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

So the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
