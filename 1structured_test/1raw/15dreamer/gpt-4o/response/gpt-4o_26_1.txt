Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, it means knowing whether one spouse is a Dreamer or Nondreamer gives no information about the classification of the other spouse. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any person from the general population is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
