Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can assume that the likelihood that any individual person is a Nondreamer is 0.20, regardless of their spouse's classification. Since the study indicates that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding another individual's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population probability.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
