Given that there is no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming based on their spouse's classification, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

The study states that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that any given individual, including Brett's wife, is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
