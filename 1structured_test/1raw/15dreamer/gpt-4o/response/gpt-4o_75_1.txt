Based on the information provided, the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding one’s classification about dreaming. This implies the spouse’s classification is independent of Brett’s classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

We know from the study that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
