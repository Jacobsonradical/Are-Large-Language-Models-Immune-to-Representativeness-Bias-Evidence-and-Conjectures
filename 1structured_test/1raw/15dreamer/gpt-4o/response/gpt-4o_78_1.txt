Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can infer that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. 

From the study, we know:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

This probability remains the same regardless of Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}
