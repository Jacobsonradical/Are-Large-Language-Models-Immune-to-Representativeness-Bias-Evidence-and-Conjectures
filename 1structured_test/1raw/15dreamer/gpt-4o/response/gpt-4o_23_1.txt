{probability: 0.2}

Explanation: According to the study, the classification of one person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not predict the spouse’s classification. Therefore, we treat the probability that Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer independently from Brett's classification. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
