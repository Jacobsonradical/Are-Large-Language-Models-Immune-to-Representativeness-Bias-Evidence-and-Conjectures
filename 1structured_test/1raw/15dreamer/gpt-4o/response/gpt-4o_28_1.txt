Given that Brett is a Nondreamer and the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, this implies that the probability distribution for Brett's wife's dreaming status is independent of Brett's dreaming status.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains the same regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
