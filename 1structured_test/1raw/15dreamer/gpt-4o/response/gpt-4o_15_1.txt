Given the study findings that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers, and that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the classification of Brett being a Nondreamer is independent of his wife's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would simply be the general probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
