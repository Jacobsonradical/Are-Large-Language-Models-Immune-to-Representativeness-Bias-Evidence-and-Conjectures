Since the study indicates that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, this implies that the classification of Brett's wife as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's own classification.

Given that the population consists of 80% Dreamers and 20% Nondreamers, these probabilities apply equally to Brett's wife.

Therefore, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as that of any randomly selected person from the population being a Nondreamer.
