Given the information provided, the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer has no influence on the classification of his spouse. This implies that the probability distribution for Brett's wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is the same as that for the general population. 

From the study, we know that:

- 80% of people are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any random person from the population to be a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2} or {probability: 20%}
