Given that Brett is classified as a Nondreamer, we want to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The study indicates that one's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding their spouse's classification. This means that the classification of one spouse is independent of the classification of the other spouse.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.2}
