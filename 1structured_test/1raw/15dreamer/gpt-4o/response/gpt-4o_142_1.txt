Given the information provided, the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20. Since the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity in determining one's classification about dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}
