Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we are asked to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. The problem states that the classification of one individual as a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding the classification of their spouse. This implies that the classification of Brett's wife is independent of Brett's classification.

Since we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, this probability also applies to any randomly chosen individual, including Brett's wife.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
