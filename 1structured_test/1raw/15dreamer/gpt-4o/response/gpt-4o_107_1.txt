Given the information from the study, we know that:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- A person's classification (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent of their spouse's classification.

Because Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Since the spouseâ€™s classification is independent, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
