Given the information that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

From the studies, we know:

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate in the population. Therefore, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
