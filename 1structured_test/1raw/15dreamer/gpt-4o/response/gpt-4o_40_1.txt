According to the study, the classification of one spouse as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no predictive validity regarding the other spouse's classification. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

From the study, we know that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
