Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the classification of one person (Dreamer or Nondreamer) provides no information about the classification of their spouse. Since every individual has the same probability of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer, we can use the overall probabilities in the population.

According to the study, 20% (0.20) of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}
