According to the information, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains independent of Brett's classification, as the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of anyone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
