Given the information provided, we know the overall probabilities of people being classified as Dreamers or Nondreamers:

- 80% of people (0.8 probability) are Dreamers.
- 20% of people (0.2 probability) are Nondreamers.

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the classification of one person (Brett) does not affect the classification of another person (Brett's wife). Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
