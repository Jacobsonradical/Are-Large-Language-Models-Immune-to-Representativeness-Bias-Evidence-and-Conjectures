Based on the information given in the study, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity. This implies that the classification of one spouse (as a Dreamer or Nondreamer) does not affect the classification of the other spouse.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.

This probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
