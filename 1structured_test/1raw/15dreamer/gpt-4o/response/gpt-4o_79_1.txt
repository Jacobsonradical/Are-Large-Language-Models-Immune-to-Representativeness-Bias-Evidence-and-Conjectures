Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer, we have no additional information provided that would link his status as a Nondreamer to his wife's status. The study specified that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett's classification as a Nondreamer gives us no insight into his wife's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer reflects the general probability within the population, which is given as 20%.

So, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
