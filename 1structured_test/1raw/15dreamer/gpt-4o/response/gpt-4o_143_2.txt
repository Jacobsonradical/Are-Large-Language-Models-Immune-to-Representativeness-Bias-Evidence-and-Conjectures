To answer this question, we need to consider the probabilities provided in the study about the general population and the fact that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" has no predictive validity between spouses.

Given that:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since a person's classification does not affect their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given individual in the population is a Nondreamer.

\[
\text{Probability (Brett’s wife is a Nondreamer)} = \text{Probability (Nondreamer)} = 0.20
\]

Hence:

{probability: 0.20}

So, the probability that Brett’s wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
