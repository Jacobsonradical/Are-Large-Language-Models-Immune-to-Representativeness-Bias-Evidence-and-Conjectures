Since the classification of dreaming or not dreaming has no predictive validity based on the spouse's classification, we can assume that the classification of one spouse is independent of the other. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of anyone being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
