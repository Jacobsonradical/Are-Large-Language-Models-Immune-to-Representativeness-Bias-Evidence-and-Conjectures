Given that oneâ€™s classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification according to the study, we can infer that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is only dependent on the overall probability distribution in the population.

The study states that 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 20%, which can be expressed as 0.2 in decimal form.
