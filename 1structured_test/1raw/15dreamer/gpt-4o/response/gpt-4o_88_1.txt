Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no influence on the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer, since the study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.
