Given that Brett is classified as a Nondreamer and that the spouse's dreaming classification has no predictive validity, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
