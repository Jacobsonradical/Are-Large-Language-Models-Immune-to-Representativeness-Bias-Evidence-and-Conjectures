Given the information provided:

- 80% of people report dreaming (classified as "Dreamers").
- 20% of people report never dreaming (classified as "Nondreamers").

Since the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability distribution for the spouse is independent of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the population.

{probability: 0.20}
