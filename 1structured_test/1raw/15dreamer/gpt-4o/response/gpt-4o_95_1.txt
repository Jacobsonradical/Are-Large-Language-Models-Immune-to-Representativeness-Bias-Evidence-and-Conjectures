Given the information provided, we know the following:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of one's spouse does not predict one's own classification.

Since the spouse's classification does not have any predictive validity, his wife's probability of being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
