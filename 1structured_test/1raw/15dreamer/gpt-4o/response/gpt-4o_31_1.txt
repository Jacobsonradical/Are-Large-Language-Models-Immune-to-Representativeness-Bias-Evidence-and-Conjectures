Given the information that the classification of a spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the study, the percentage of people who are Nondreamers is 20%.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
