Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The study indicates that the classification of a spouse's dreaming habits has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification. This suggests that the dreaming statuses of spouses are independent events.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of any individual, including Brett's wife, being a Nondreamer is 20%. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
