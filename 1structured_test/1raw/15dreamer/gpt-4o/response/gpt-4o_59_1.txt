Given that the classification of whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity based on their spouse's classification, we can infer that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

From the general population, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer would be:

{probability: 0.2}
