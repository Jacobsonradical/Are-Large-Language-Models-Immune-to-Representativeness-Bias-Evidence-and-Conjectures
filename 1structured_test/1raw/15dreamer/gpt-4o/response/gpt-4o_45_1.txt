Given the information provided:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

The classification of oneâ€™s spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, indicating that the classification of Brett as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his wife.

So, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
