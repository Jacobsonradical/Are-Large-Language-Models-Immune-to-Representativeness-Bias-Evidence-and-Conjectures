Given that the classification of a spouse's dreaming behavior has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should just reflect the overall probability in the general population.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.

Thus, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
