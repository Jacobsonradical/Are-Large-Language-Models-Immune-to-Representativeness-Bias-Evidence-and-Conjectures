{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether or not Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
