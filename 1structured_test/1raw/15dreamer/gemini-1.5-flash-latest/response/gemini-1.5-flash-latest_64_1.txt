{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
