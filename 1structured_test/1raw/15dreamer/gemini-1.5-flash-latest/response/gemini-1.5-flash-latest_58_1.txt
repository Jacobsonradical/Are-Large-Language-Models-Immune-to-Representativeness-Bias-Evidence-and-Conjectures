{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a dreamer or not has no impact on the probability of his wife being a dreamer.  

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
