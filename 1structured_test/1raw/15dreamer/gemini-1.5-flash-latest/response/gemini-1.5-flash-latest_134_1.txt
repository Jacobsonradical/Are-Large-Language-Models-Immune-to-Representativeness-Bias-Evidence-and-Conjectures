{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his wife's dreaming habits. Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20% or 0.2.
