{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that being a Nondreamer or Dreamer is independent of the spouse's status.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
