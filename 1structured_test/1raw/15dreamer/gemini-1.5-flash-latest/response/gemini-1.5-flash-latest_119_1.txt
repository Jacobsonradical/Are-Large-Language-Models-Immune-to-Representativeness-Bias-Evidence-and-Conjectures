The study explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
