The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
