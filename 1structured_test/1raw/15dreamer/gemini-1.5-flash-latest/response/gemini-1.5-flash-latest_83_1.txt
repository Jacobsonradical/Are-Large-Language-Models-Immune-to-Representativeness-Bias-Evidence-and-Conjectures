{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife dreams or not is independent of Brett's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
