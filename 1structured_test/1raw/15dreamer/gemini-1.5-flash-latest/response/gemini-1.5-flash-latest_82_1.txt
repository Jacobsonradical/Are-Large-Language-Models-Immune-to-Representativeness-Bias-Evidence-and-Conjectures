{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer tells us nothing about the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
