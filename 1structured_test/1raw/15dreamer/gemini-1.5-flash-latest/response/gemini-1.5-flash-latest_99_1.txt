{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of his own classification.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
