{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
