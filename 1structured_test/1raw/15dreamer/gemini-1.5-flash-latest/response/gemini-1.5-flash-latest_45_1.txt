{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the spouse's classification has "no predictive validity" regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer tells us nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
