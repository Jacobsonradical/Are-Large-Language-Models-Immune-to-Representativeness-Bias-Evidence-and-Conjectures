{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is still 0.2.
