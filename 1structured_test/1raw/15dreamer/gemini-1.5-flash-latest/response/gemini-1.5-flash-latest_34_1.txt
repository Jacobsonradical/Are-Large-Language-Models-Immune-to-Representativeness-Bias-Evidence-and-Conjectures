* The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. 
* This means whether Brett dreams or not has no impact on whether his wife dreams or not.
* The overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is still 20%.
