The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his wife's dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
