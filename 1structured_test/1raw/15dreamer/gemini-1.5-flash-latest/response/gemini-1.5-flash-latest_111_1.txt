The passage explicitly states that the spouse's classification has "no predictive validity" regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife dreams or not is independent of the fact that he is a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
