{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his wife's dreaming habits.  

Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20% or 0.2.
