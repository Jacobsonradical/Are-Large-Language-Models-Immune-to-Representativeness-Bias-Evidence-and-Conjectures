{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of his classification.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
