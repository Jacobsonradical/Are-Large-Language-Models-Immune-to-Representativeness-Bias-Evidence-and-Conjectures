{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
