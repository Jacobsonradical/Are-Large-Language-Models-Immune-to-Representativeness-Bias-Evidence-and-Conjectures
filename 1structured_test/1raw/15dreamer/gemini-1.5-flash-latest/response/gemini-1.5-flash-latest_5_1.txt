{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer remains at **0.2**.
