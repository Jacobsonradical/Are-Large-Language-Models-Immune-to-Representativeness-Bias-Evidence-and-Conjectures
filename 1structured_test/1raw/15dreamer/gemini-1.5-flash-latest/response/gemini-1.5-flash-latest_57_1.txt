{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer doesn't affect the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
