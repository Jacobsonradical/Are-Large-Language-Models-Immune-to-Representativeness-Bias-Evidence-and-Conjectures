{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.  This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
