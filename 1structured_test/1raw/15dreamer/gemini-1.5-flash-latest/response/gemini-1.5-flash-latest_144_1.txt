{probability: 0.2} 

The passage explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
