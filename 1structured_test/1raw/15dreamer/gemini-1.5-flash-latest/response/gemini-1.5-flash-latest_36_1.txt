{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his wife's dream classification.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer remains at 0.2.
