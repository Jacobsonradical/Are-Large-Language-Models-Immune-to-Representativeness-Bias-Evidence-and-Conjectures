{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.
