{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.  Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is still **0.2**.
