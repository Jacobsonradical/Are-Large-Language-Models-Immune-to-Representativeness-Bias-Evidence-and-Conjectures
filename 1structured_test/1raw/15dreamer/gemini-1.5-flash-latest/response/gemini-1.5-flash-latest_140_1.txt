{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a dreamer or a nondreamer is independent of Brett being a nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
