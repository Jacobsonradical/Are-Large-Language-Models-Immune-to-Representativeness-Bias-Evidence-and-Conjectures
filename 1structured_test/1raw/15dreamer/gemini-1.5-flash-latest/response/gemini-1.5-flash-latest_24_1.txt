{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
