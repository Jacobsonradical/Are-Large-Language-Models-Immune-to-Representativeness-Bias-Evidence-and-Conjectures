{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
