Here's why:

The study explicitly states that the spouse's classification has *no* predictive validity regarding one's own classification. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about his wife's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.
