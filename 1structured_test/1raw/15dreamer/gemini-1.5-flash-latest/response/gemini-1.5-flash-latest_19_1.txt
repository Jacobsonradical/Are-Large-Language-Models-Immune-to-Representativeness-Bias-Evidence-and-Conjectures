The text explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20%.
