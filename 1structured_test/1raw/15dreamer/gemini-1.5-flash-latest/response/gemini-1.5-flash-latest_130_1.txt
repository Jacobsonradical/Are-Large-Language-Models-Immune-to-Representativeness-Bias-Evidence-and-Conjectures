The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.  This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no additional information about his wife's dreaming habits.  

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
