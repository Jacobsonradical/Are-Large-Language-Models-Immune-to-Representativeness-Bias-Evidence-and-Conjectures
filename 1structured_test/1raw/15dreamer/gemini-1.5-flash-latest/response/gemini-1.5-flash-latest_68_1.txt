{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
