{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer has no bearing on his wife's classification. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
