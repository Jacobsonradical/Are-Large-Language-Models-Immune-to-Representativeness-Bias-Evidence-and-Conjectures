{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.  This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
