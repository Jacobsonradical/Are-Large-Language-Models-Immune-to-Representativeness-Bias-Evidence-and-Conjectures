{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.  This means that whether Brett's wife dreams or not is independent of whether Brett dreams.  Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
