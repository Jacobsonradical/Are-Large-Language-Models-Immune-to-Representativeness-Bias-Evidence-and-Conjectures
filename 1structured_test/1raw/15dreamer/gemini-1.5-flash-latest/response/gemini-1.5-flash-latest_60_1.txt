{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
