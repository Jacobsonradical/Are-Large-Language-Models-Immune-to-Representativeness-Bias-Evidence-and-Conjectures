{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't influence the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
