{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
