{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
