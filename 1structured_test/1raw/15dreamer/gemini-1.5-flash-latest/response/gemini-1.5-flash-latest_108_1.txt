{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
