The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on the likelihood of his wife being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2.
