{probability: 0.2}

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.
