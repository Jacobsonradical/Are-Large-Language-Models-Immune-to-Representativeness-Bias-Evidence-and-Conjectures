{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
