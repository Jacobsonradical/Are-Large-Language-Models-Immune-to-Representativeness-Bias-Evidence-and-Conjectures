{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not change the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
