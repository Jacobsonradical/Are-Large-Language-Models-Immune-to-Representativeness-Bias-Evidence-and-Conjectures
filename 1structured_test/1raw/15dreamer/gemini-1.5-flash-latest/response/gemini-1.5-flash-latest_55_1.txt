The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about his wife's dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
