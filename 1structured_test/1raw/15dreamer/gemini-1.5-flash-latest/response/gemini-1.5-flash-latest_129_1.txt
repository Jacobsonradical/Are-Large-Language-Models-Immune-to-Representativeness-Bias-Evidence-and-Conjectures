{probability: 0.2}

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer, it has no impact on the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
