{probability: 0.2} 

The passage explicitly states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett's wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
