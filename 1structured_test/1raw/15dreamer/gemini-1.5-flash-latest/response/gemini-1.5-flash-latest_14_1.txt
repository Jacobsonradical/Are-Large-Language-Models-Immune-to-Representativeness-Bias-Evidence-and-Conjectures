The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20%.
