{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not change the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is still 0.2.
