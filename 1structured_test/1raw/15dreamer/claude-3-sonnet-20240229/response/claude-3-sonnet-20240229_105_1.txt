{probability: 0.2}

The given information states that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., Nondreamers), and it is mentioned that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply 0.2, regardless of Brett's classification.
