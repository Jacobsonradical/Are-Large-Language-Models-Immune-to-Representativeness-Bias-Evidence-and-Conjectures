{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer should be independent of Brett's classification. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
