{probability: 0.2}

The question states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Since the study found that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and these people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), regardless of Brett's classification.
