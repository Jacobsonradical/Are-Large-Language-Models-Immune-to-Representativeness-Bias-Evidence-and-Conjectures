{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of people classified as Nondreamers in the general population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
