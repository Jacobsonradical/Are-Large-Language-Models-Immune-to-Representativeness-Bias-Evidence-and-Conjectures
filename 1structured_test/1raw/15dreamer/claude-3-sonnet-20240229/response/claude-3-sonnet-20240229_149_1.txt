{probability: 0.2}

The given information states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," meaning they claim they do not remember ever dreaming. It is also mentioned that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and his wife's classification is independent of his, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
