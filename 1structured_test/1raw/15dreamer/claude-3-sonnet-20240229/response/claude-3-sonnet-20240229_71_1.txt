{probability: 0.2}

The question states that a person's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" has no relation to their spouse's classification. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Since the study found that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
