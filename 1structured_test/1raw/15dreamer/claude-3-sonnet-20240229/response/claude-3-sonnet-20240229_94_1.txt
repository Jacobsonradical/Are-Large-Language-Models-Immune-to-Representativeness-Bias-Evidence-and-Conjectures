{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.
