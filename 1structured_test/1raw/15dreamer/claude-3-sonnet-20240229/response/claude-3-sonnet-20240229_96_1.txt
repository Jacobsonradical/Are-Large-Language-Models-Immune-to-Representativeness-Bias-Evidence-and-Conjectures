{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that "the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), regardless of Brett's classification.
