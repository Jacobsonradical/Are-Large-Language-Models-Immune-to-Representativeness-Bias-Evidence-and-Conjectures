{probability: 0.2}

Given that the study found that a person's classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent of their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer should be equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

The spouse's classification does not provide any additional information to modify the probability, as the study stated that there is no predictive validity between the classifications of spouses regarding dreaming.
