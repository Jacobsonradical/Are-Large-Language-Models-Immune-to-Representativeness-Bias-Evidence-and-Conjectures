{probability: 0.2}

The question states that whether a person is a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent of their spouse's classification. This means that the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
