{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is given as 0.2 or 20%.
