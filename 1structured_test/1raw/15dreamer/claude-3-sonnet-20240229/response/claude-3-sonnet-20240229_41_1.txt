{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The study found that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also stated that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.
- This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
- Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), regardless of Brett's classification.
