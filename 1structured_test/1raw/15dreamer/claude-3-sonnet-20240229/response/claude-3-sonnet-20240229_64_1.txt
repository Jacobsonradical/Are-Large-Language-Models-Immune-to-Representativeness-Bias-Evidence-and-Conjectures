{probability: 0.2}

The question states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
