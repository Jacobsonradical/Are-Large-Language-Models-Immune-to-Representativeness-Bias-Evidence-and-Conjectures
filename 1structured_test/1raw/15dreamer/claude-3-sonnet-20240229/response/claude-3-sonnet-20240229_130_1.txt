{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and this proportion is the same for both sexes. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
