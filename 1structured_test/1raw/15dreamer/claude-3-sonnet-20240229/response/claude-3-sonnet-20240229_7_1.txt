{probability: 0.2}

Given that the study found that a spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer should be independent of Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
