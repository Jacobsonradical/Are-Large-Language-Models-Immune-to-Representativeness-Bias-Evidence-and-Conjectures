Since the spouse's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer. Hence, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which the study has found to be 20%.
