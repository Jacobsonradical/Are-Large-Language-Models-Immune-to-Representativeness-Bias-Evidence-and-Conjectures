{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that there's no connection between a person's dream classification and their spouse's classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
