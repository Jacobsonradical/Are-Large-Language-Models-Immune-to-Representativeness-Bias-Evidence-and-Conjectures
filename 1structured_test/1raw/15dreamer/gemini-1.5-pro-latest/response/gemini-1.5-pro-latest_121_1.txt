{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dreaming classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
