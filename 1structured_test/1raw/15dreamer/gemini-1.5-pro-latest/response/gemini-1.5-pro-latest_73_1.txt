{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The study states that a spouse's dream classification has *no predictive validity* on the other spouse's classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer tells us absolutely nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains the same (20% or 0.2) regardless of Brett's classification.
