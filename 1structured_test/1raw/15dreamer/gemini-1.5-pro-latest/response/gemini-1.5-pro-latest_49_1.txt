{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
