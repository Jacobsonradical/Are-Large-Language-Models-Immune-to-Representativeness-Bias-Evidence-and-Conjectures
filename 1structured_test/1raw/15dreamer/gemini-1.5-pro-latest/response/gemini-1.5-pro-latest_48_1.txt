{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is completely independent of his own classification.  

Since 20% of the general population are considered Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's status.
