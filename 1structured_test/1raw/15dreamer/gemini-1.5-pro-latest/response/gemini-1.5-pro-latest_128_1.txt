{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt clearly states that a spouse's dream classification has *no predictive validity* on the other spouse's classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.
