{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The study states that there is **no predictive validity** between a person's dream classification and their spouse's.  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer tells us *nothing* about his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are considered "Nondreamers", there's a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's classification.
