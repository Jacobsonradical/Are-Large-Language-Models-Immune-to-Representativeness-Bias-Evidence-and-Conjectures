Here's why:

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer tells us *nothing* about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
