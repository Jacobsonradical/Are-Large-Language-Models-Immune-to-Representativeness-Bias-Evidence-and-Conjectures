{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The study states that a spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on an individual's dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer tells us *nothing* about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 20%, or 0.2.
