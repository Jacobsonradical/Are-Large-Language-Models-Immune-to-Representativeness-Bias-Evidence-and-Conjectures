{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is completely independent of Brett's own classification.  

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", there's a 20% probability that Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer himself.
