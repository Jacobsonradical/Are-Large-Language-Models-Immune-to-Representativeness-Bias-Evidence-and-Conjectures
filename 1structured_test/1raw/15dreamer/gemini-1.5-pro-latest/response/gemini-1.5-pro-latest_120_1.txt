{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification.  This means Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is completely independent of Brett's status. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife falls into that category.
