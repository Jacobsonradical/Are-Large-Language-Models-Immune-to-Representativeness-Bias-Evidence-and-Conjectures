{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming."  

This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has absolutely no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance his wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
