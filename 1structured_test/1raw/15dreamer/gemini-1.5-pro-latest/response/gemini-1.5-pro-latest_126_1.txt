{probability: 0.2} 

The prompt states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
