{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means there's no correlation between Brett being a Nondreamer and his wife's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
