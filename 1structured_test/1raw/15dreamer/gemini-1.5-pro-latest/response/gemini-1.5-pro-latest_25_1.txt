{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming."  

This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has absolutely no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.  Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population of Nondreamers: 20%, or 0.2.
