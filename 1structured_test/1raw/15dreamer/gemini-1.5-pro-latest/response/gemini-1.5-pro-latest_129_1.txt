{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming".  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance his wife is a Nondreamer regardless of Brett's classification.
