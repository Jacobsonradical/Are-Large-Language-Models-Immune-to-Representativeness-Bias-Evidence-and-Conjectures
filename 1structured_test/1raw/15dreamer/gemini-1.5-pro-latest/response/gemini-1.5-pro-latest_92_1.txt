{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification.  This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer tells us absolutely nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are considered Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
