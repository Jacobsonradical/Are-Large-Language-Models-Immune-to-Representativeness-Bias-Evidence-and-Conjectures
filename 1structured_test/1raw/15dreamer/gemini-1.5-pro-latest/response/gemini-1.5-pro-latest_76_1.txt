{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The study states that there's *no predictive validity* between spouses regarding dreaming classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is also simply 20%, or 0.2.
