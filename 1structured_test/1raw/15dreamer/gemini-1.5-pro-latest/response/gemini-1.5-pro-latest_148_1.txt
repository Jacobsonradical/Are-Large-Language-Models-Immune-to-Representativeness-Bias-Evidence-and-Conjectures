{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The study states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dreaming classification.  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's classification.
