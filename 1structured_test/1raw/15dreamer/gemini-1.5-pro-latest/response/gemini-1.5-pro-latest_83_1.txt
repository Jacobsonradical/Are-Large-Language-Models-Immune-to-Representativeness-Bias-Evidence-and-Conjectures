{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt clearly states that the spouse's dream classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification.  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", there is a 20% chance Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
