{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has absolutely no bearing on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population average, which is 20% or 0.2.
