{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are considered Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%.
