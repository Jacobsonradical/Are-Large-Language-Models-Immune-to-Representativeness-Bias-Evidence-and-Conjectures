{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means there is **no correlation** between whether Brett dreams and whether his wife dreams. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the general population probability of being a "Nondreamer".
