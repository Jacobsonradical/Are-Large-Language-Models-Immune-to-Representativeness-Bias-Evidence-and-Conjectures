**Explanation:**

The study states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's own dream classification. This means there's no relationship between whether Brett dreams and whether his wife dreams.  

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the population average.
