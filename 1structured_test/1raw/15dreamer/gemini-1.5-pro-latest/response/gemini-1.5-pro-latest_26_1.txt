{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that there's *no predictive validity* between a person's dream classification and their spouse's classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no bearing on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," there's a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's classification.
