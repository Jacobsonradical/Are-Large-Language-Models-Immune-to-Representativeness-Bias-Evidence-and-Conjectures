{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
