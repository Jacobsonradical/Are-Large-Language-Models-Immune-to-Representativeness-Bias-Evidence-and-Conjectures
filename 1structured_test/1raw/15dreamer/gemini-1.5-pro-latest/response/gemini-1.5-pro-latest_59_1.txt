The study states that there is **no predictive validity** between a person's dream classification and their spouse's. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer provides no information about his wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are considered Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer remains at the baseline level.
