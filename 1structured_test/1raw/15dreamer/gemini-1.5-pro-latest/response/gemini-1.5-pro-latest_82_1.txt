{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that there is no correlation between a spouse's dream classification and one's own. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on his wife's likelihood of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same: 20%, or 0.2.
