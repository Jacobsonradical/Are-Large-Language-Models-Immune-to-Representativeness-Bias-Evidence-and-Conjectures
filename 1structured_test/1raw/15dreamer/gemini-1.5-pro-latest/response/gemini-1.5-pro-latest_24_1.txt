{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer tells us absolutely nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are considered Nondreamers, there's a 20% chance his wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's classification.
