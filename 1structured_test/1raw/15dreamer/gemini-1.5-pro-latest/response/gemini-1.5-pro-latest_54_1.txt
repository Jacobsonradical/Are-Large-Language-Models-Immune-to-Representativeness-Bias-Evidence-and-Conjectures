{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means Brett's dream classification is independent of his wife's.  

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife also being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same: 20%.
