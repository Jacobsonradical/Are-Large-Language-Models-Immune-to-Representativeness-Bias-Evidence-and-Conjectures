{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer tells us absolutely nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
