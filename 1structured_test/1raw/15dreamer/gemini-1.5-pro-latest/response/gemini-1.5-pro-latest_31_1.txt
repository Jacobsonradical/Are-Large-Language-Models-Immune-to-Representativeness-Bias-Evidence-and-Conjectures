{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that a spouse's dream classification has *no predictive validity* on the other spouse's classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
