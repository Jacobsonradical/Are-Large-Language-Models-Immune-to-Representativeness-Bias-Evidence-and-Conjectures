{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The study states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's own dreaming classification. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer tells us absolutely nothing about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
