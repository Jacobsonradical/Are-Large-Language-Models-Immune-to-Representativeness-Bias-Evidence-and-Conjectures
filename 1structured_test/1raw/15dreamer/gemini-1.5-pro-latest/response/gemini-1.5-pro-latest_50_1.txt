{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer provides no information about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of anyone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or **0.2**.
