{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that there is no correlation between the dreaming classification of spouses. This means that Brett's wife's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is independent of his own classification. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
