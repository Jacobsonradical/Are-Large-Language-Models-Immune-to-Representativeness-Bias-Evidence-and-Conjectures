{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is completely independent of whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency, which is 20% or 0.2.
