{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", there is a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category regardless of his own classification.
