{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that spouse classification has *no predictive validity* on one's own dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
