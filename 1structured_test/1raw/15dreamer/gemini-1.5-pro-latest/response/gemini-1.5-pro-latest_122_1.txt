{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's own dreaming classification.  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, there's a 20% probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
