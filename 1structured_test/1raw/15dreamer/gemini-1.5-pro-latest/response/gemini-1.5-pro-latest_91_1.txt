{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming."  

This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has absolutely NO impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance Brett's wife is a Nondreamer.
