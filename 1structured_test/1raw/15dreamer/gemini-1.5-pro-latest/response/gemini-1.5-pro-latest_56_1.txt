{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The study states that a spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's own dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also **20%**, regardless of Brett's classification.
