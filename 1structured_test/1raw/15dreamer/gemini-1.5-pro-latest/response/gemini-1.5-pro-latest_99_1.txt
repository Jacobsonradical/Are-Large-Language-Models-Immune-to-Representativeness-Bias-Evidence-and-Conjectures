{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means there is no relationship between Brett's dream classification and his wife's. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, or 0.2.
