{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," there's a 20% chance Brett's wife falls into that category, regardless of Brett's classification.
