{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that there is *no* predictive validity between spouses regarding dream classification. This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer has no impact on the likelihood of his wife being a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same: 20%.
