{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The study states that the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's own dream classification. This means Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is **20% or 0.2**.
