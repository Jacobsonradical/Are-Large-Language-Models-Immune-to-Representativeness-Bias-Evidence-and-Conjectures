{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming". This means Brett's classification as a Nondreamer tells us *nothing* about whether his wife is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is **20% or 0.2**.
