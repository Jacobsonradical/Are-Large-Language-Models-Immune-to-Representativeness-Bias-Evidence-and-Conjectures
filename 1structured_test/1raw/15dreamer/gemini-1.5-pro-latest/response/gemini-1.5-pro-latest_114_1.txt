{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that "the spouse's classification has *no predictive validity* regarding one's classification about dreaming." This means that whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is completely independent of whether his wife is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
