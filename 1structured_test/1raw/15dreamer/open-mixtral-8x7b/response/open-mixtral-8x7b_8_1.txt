{probability: 0.2, explanation: The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't provide any information about his wife's dreaming habits, as the spouse's classification has no predictive validity. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.}
