{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
