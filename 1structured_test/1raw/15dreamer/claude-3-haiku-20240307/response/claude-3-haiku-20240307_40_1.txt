To solve this problem, we can use the information provided in the question about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is that since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
