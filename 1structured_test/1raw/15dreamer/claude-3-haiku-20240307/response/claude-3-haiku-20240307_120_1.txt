To answer this question, we need to consider the given information:

1. 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
2. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the study found that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no bearing on the individual's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
