Given the information provided:

- 80% of people report that they dream, even if occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is that since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification is independent, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
