To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the principles of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%) because the classification of a person as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of their spouse's classification. The study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
