To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
