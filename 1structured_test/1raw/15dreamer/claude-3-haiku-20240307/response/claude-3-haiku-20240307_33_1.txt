To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

The study found that 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
