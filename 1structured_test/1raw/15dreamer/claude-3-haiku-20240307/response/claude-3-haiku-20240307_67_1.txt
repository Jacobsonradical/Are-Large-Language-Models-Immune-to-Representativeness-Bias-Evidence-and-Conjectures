To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and non-dreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers". Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
