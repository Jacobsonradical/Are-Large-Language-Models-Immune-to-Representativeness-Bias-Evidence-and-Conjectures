To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can assume that the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population, which is 20% or 0.2.
