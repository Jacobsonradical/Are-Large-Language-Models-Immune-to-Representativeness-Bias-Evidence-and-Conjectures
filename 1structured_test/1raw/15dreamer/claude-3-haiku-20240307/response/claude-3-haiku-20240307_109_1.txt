To answer this question, we need to consider the given information:

1. 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
2. 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (20%), regardless of Brett's classification.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity, so the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not impact the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
