To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, as the study has found that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

{probability: 0.20}
