Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers"
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2) regardless of the spouse's classification.
