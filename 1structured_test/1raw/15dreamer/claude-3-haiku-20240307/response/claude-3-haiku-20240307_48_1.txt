Assuming the information provided in the question is accurate, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, which is the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.20}
