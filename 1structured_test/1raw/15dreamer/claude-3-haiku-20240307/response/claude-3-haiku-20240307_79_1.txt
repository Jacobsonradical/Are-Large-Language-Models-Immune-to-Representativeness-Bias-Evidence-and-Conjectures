To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
