Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
