Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the study found that 20% of people are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification does not affect the probability of the other spouse's classification.
