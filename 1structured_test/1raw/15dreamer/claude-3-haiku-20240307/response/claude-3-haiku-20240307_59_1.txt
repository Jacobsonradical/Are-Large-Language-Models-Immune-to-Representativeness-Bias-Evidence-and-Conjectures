Given the information provided:
* 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
* 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
* The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because there is a 20% chance that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, and this probability is independent of the spouse's classification.
