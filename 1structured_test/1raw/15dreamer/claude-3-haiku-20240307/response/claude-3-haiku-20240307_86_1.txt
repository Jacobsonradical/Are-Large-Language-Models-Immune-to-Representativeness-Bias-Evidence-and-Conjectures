To answer this question, we need to consider the given information and the probabilities of the spouse's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. In other words, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of the Nondreamer population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
