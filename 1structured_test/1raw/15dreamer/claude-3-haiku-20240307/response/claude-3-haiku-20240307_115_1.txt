To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
