To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
