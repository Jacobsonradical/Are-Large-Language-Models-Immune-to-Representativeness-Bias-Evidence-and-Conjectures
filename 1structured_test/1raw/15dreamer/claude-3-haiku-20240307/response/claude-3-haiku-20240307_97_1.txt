To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the lack of predictive validity of the spouse's classification.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
