To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The question states that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a "Dreamer" is 0.8 and the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.

The question also states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the probability of the wife being a "Nondreamer" is independent of the husband being a "Nondreamer".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, which is the same as the probability of being a "Nondreamer" in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
