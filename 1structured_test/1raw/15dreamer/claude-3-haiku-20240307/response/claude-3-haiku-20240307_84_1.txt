To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
