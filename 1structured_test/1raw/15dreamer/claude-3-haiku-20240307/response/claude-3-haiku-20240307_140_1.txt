To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%), which is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population. This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
