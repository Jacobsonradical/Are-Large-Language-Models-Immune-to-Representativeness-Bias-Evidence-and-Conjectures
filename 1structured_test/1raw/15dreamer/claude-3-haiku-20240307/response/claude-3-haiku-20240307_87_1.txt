To answer this question, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided, 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a "Dreamer" is 0.8 and the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.

The study has also found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
