To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can assume that the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is independent of his classification.

The probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is simply the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
