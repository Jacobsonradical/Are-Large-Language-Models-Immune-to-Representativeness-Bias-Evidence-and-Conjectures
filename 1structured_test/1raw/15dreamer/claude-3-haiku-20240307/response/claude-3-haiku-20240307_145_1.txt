Based on the given information:
* 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
* 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
* The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is that since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
