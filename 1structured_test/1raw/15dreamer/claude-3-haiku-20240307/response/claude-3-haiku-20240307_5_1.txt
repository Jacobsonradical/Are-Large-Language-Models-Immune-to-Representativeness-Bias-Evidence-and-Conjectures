To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20, or 20%, as this is the proportion of nondreamers in the population.
