To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, either occasionally or regularly.
- 20% of people claim that they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
