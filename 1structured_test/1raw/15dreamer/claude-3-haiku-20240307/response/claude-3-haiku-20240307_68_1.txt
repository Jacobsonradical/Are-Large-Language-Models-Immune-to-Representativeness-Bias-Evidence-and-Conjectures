To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the principles of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream, even if occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
