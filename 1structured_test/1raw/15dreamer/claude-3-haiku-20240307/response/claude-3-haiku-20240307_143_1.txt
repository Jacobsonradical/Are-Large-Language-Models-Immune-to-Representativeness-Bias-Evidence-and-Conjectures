To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information.

The study states that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers." Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, as stated in the problem. Therefore, the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

{probability: 0.20}
