To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The study found that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a "Dreamer" is 0.8 and the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.

The key information from the problem statement is that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
