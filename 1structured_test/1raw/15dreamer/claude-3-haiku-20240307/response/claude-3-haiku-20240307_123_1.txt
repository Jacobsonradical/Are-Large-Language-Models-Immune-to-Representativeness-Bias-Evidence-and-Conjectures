To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

The spouse's classification has no predictive validity, so the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer.
