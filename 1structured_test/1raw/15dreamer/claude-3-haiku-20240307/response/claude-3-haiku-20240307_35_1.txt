To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The study indicates that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability of the wife being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
