To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

The spouse's classification has no predictive validity, which means that knowing Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.
