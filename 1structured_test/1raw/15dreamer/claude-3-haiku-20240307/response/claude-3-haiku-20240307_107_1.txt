Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the spouse's classification is independent of the other's, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of a Nondreamer being married to another Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
