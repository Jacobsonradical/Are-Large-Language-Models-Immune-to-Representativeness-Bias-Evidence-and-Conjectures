To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the principles of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
