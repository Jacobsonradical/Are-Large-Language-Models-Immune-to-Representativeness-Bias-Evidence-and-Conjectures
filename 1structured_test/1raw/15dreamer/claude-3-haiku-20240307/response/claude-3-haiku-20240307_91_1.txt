To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the fact that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
