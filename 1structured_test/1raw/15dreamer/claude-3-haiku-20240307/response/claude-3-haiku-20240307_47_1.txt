To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
