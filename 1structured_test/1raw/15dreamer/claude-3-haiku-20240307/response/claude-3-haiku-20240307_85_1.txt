Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
- This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, so the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
