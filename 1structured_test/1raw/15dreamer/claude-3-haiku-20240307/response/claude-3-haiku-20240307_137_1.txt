To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the study, 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since the study also found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
