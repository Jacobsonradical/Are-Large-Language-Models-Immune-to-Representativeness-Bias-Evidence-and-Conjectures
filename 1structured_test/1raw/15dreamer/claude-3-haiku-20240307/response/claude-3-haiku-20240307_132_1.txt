To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
