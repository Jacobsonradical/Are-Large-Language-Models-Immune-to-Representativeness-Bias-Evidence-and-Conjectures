Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (20%) since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity.
