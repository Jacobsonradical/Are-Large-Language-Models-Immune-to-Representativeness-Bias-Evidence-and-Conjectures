To solve this problem, we need to consider the information provided about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, at least occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
