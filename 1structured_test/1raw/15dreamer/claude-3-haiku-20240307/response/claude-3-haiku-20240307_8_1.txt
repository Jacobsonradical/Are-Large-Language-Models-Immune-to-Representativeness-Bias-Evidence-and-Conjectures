To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
