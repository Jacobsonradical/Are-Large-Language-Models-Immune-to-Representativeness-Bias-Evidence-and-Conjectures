To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the population distribution of dreamers and nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The population distribution of dreamers and nondreamers is 80% and 20%, respectively.
- Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 0.2 or 20%.
