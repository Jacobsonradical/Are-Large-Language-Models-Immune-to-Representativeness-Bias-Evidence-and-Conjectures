To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

This means that the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Since the study found that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
