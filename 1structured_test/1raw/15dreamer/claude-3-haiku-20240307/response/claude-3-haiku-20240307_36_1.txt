To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information and the independence of the spouses' classifications regarding dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
