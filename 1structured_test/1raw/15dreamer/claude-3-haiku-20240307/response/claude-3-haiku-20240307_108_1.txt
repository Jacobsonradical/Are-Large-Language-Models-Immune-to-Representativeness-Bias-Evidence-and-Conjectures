To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The problem statement indicates that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
