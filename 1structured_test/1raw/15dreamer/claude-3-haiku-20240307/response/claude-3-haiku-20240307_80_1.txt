To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. This means that the probability is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
