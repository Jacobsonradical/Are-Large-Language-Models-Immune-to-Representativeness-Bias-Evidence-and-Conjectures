To answer this question, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. This means that the probability is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.2}
