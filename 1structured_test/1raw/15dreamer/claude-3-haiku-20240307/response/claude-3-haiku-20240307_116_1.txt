Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is that since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
