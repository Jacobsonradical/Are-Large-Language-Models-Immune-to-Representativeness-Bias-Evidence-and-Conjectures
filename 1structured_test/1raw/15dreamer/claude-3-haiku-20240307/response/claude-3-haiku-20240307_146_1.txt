To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
