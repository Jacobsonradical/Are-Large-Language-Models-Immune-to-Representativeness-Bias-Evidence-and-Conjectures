To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
