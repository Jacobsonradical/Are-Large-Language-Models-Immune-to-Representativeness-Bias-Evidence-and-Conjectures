To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the study has found that 20% of people are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
