To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided in the study:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"

Since the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
