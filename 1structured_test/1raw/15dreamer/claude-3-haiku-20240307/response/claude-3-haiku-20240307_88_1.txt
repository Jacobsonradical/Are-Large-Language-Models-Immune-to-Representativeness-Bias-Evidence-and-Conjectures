To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report dreaming, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
