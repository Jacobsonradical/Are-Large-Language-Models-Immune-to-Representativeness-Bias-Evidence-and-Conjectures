To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the problem.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
