To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the fact that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the general proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
