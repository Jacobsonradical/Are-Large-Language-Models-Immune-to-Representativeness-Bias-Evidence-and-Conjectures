To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information.

The study found that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers". Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
