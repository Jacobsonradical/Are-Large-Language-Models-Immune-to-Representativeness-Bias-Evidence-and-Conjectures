The probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers". Since the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
