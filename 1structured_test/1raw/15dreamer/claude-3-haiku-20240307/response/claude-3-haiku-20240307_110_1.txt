To answer this question, we need to consider the following information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
