To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of his classification. The probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

The answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.20}
