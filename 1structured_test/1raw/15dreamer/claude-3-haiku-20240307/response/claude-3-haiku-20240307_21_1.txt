To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, i.e., they are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%), as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%. The information that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer, as the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.
