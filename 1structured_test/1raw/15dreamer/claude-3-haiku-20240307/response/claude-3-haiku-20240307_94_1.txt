To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the lack of predictive validity regarding the spouse's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
