To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. In other words, the fact that Brett is a "Nondreamer" does not provide any additional information about the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, or 20%.
