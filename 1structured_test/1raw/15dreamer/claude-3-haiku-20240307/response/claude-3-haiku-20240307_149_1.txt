To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any information about the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer.
- Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
