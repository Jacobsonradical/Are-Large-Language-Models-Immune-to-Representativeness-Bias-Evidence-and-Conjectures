To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the population proportion of "Nondreamers", which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
