To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
