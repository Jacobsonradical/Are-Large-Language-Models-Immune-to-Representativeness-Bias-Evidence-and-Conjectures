Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, even occasionally
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of being a Nondreamer is independent of the spouse's classification, and 20% of the population are Nondreamers.
