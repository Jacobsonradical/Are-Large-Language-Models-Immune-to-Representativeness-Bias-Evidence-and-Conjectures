To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
