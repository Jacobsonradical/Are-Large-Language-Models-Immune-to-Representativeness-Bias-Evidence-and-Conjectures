To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

1. 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream, even if occasionally.
2. 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer would be 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.20}
