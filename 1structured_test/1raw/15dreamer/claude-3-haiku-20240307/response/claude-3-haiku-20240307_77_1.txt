Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because if 20% of people are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
