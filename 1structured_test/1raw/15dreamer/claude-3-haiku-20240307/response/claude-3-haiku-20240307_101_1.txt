Based on the information provided, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.4.

The study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any information about the likelihood of his wife being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.4.
