Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, so the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
