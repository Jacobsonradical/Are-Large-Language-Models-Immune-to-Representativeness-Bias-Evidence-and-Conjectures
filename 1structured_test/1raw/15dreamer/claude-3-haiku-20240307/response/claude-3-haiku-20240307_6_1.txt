To solve this problem, we need to consider the information provided about the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
