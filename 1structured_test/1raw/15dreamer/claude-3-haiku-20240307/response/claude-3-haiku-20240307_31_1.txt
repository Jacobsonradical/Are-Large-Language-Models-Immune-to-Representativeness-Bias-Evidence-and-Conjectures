To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since there is no relationship between the dreaming classifications of spouses, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
