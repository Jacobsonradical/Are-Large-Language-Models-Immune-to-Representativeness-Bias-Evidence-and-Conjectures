To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the lack of predictive validity between a spouse's classification and one's own classification.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, as the study has found that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification.
