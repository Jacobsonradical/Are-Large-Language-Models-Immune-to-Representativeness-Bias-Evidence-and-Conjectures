To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
