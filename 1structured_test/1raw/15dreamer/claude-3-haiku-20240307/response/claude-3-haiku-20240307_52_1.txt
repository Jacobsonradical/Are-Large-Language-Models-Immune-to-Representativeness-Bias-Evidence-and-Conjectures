To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The information provided states that 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a "Dreamer" is 0.8 (80%) and the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2 (20%).

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability of Brett's wife being a "Nondreamer" is independent of Brett's classification as a "Nondreamer".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}
