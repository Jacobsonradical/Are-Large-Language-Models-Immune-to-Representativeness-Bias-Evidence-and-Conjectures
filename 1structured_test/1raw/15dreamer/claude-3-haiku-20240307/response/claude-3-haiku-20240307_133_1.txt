Given the information provided, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The study found that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population proportion, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
