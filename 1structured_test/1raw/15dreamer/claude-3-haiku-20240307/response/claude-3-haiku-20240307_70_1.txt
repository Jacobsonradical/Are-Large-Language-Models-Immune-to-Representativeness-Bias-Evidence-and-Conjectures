To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
