To calculate the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", meaning they report dreaming occasionally.
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
