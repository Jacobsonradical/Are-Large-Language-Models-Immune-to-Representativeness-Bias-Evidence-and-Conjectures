To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the lack of predictive validity of the spouse's classification.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is not directly related to his classification.

According to the information provided, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, regardless of the spouse's classification.
