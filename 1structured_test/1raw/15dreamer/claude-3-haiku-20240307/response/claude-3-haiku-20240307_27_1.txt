To find the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as Dreamers, and 20% are classified as Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
