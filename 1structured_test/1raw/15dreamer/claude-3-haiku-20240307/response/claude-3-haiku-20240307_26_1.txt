Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report dreaming, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we can assume that the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
