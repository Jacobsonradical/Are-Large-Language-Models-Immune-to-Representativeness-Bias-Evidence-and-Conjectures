To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim that they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
