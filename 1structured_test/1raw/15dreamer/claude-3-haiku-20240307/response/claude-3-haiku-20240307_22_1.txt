To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the problem statement.

According to the problem, 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. These 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is that since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population, which is 20% or 0.2.
