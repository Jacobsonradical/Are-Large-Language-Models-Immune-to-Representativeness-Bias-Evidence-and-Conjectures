To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
