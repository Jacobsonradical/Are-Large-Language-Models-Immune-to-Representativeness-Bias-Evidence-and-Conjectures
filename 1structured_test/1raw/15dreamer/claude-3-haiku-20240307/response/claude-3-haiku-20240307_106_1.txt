To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information and the independence of the dreaming classification between spouses.

Given:
- 80% of people report dreaming, while 20% are Nondreamers.
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is classified as a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. This means that the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
