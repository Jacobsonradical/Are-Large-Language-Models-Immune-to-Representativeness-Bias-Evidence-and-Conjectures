Based on the given information, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The study found that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
