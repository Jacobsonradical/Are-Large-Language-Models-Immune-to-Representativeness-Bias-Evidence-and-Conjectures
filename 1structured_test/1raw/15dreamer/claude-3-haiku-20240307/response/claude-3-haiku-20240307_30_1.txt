Given the information provided:

- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the study found that 20% of people are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, meaning that the probability of the wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.
