To determine the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information provided in the problem statement.

The problem states that 80% of people, regardless of sex, report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Dreamer is 0.8 and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2.

The problem also states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
