To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
