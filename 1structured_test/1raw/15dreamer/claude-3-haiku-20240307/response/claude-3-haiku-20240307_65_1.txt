Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, even if occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- If 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, then the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the baseline probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
