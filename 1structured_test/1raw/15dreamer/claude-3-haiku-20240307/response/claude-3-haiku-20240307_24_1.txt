To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the percentages of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
