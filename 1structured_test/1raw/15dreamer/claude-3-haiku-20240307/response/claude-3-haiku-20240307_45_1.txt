To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification.

The probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population is 20%, and this probability remains the same regardless of Brett's classification.
