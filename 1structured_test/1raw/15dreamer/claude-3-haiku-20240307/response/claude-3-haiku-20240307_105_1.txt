To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his wife is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
