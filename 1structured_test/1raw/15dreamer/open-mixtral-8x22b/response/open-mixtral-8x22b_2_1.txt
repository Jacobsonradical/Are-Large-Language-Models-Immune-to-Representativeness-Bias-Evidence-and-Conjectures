The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
