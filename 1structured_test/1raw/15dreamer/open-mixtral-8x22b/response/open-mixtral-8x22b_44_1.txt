{probability: 0.2, explanation: Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
