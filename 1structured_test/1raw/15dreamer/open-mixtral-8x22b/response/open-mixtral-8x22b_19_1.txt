{probability: 0.2, Explanation: The study mentioned that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as any other person. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
