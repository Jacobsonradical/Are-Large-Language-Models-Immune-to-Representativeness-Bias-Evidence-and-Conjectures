Given that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, it means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his wife is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, we can assume that the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
