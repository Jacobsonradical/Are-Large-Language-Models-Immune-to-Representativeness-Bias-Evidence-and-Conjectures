{probability: 0.2,
The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is simply the base rate given in the study, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.}
