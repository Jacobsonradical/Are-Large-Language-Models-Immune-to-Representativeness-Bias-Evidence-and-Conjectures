{probability: 0.2}

Since the classification of one's spouse has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the base rate of Nondreamers in the population. Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability is 0.2.
