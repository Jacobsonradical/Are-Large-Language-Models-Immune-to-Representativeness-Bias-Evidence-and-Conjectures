{probability: 0.2}

Since there is no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming based on their spouse's classification, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population. According to the study, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
