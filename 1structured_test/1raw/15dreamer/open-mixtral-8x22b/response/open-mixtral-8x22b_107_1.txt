{probability: 0.2}

Since the study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the reported probability of Nondreamers in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
