The study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether or not Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer. According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
