{probability: 0.2}

Since the study found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, it means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not does not influence his wife's probability of being a Nondreamer. According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
