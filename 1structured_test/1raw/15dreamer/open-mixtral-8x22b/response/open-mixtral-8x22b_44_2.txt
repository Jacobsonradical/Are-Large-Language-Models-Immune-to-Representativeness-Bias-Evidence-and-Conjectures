The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not has no influence on his wife's classification as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 (or 20%).}
