{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife's dreaming classification is independent of Brett's. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
