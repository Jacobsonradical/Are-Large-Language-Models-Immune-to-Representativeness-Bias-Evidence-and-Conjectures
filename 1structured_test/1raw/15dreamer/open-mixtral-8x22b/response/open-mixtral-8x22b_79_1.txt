{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, and the study has found that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%). This means that regardless of Brett's classification, his wife's classification as a Nondreamer or Dreamer is independent and has a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer.
