{probability: 0.2}

The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, Brett's wife being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer is not influenced by Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of all people are classified as Nondreamers, it is reasonable to assume that there is a 0.2 probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
