{probability: 0.2}

Given that the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers is 80% and 20%, respectively, and that there's no correlation between spouses regarding dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.

This probability remains the same regardless of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer, as there is no predictive validity regarding the spouse's classification about dreaming.
