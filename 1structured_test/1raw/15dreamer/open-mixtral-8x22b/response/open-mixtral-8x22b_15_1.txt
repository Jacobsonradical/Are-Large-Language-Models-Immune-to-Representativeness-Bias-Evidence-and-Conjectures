{probability: 0.2, Explanation: Since the study finds that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can conclude that Brett's wife's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.}
