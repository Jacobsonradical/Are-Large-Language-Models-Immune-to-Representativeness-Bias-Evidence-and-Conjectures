{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population. Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
