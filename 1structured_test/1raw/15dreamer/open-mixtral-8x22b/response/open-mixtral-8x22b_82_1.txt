{probability: 0.2,
This is based on the information given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, it means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability remains 0.2 or 20%.

Please note that this probability is a population-level estimate and does not guarantee the status of any individual, including Brett's wife. The actual probability may vary based on individual differences.}
