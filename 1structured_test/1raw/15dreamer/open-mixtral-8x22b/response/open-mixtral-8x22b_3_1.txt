{probability: 0.2}

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer, as the study mentioned that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. The probability of someone being a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer remains 0.2, regardless of Brett's own classification.
