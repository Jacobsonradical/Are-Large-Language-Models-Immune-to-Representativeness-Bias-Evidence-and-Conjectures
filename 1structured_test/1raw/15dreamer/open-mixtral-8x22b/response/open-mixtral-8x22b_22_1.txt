{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as the general population. Given that 20% of people claim to be Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's wife also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
