{probability: 0.2}

Given that the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers is 80% and 20% respectively, and the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
