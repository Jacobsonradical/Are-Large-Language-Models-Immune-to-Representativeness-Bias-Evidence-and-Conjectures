{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer doesn't affect his wife's classification. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
