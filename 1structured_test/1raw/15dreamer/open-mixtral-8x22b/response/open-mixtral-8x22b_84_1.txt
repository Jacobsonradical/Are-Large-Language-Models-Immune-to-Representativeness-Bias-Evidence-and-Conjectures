{probability: 0.2}
This is based on the given information that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming. Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as any other person. Therefore, there is a 0.2 probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer.
