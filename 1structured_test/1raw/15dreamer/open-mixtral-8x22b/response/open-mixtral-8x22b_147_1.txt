{probability: 0.2}

Since the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, and 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability remains 0.2, which is the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.
