{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife has the same probability of being a Nondreamer as any other person.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
