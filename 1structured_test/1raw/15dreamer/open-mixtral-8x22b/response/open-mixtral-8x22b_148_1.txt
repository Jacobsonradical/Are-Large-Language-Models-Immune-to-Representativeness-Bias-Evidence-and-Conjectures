{probability: 0.2}

Given that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers has no predictive validity regarding one's spouse, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of nondreamers in the population. According to the study, 20% of people report being nondreamers, which is equivalent to a probability of 0.2.
