As the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the classification of Brett's wife as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's classification. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
