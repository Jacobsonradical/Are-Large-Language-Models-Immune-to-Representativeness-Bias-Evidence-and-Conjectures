{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that Brett's wife's classification is independent of his. Therefore, the probability that his wife is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.
