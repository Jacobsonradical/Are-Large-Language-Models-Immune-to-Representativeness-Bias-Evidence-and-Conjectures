{probability: 0.2}

Given that the study found no predictive validity between spouses regarding dreaming classifications, we can assume that Brett's wife's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of his classification. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
