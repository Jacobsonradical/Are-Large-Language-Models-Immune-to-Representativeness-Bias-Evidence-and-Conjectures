{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population's Nondreamer rate. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
