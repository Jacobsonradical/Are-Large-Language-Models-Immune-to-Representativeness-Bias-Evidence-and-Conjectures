{probability: 0.2}

Since there is no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming based on their spouse's classification, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability is the same as the general population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
