{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's own classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
