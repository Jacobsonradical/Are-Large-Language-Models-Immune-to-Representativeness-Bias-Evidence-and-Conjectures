{probability: 0.2}

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer, as the study has found that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20%, or 0.2 in probability terms.
