{probability: 0.2,
The study states that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming. This means that whether Brett is a Nondreamer does not influence his wife's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the study, which is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.}
