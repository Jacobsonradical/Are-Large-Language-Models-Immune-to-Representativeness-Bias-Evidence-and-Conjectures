Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population. According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
