{probability: 0.2}

As the study indicates that the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, we can assume that the probability of Brett's wife being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
