{probability: 0.2}

Since the spouse's classification has no predictive validity regarding one's classification about dreaming, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his wife also being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's wife is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 0.2 or 20%.
