{probability: 0.2}

The study suggests that a person's dreaming classification (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent of their spouse's classification. Therefore, regardless of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer, his wife's classification as a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's wife is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
