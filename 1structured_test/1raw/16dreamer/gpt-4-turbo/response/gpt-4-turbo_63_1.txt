Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
