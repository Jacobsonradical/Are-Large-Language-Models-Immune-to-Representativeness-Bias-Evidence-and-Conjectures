Given that the trait of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Therefore, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
