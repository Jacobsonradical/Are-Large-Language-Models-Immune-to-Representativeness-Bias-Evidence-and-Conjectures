Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brettâ€™s status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given in the problem, 20% of people report never remembering dreaming, which makes them Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
