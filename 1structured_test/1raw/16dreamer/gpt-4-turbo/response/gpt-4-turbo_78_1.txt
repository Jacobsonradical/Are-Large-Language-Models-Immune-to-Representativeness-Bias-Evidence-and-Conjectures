Given that the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

From the problem statement, 20% of the people report that they do not remember ever dreaming, which means they are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
