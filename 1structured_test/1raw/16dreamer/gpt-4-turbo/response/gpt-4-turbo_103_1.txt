Since the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the dreaming status of Brett's father is independent of Brett's status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a randomly selected individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%. 

Expressed as a decimal, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
