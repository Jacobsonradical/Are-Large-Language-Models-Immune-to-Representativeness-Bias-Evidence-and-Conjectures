Since the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent between generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer.
