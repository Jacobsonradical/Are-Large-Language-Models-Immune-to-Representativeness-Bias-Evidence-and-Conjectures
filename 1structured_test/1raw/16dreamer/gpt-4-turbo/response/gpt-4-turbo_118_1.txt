Given that the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett being a Nondreamer. Hence, we can directly use the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which from the problem statement is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
