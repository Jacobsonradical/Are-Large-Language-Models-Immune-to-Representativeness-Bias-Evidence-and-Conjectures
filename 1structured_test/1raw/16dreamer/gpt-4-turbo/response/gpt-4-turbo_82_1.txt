Given that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Since the overall probability in the general population that someone is a Nondreamer is 20%, and this trait is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.
