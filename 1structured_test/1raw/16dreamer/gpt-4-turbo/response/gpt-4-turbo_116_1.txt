Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect, nor is it affected by, the dream status of his father. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2.
