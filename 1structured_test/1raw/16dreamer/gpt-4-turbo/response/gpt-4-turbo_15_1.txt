Based on the information provided, the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of anyone being a Nondreamer is not influenced by their parent's dreaming status.

Given that 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer would then also be 20%, regardless of Brett's status.

Thus the formal answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
