Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his father is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer solely depends on the general probability of being a Nondreamer.

The general population data states that 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, classifying them as Nondreamers. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.
