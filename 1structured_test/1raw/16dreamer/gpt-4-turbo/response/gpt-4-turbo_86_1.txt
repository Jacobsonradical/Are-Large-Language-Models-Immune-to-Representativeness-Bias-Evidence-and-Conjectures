Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population. Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers (i.e., they do not remember ever dreaming):

{probability: 0.2}
