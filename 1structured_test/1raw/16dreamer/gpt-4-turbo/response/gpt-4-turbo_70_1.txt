Since the classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability in the population that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population report they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., they are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
