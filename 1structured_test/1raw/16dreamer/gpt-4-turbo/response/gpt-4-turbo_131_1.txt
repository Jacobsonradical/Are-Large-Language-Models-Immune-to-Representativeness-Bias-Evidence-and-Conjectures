Given that the characteristic of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence or is not influenced by whether his father is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer simply reflects the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of the general population are Nondreamers. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
