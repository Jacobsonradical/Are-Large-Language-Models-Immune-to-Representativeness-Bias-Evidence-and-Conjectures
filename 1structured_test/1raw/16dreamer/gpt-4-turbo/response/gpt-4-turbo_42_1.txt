Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's status as a Nondreamer. The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
