Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probabilities concerning his father's dreaming status. The probability of someone being a Nondreamer stands constant at 20% across different generations because of their independence.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the baseline probability for the general population:

{probability: 0.2}
