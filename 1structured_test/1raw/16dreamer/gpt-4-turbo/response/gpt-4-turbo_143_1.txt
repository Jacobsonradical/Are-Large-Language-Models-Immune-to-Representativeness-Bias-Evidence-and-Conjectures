Since the status of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent between generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. The proportion of Nondreamers in the general population is given as 20%.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, regardless of Brett's status.
