Since the trait of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Given this independence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being classified as a Nondreamer.

As stated, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which implies they are Nondreamers. Therefore, expressing this percentage as a probability:

{probability: 0.20}
