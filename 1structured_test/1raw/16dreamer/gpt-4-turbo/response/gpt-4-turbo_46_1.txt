Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not depend on his father's classification. This means we consider the general population probabilities for Dreamers and Nondreamers without considering familial ties.

Given that 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is based on this general probability, irrespective of Brett's dreaming status. 

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
