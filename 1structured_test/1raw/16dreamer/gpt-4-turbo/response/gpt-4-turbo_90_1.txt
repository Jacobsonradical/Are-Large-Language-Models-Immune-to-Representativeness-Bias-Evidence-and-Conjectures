Given that the classification into "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his father is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

From the information provided:
- 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is therefore 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
