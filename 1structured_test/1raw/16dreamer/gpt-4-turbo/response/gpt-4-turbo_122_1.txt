Given that being a "Nondreamer" or "Dreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the dreaming status of his father.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of the population that are Nondreamers, which is given as 20%. 

Expressed as a probability (where 1 corresponds to certainty and 0 indicates impossibility), this is:

{probability: 0.20}
