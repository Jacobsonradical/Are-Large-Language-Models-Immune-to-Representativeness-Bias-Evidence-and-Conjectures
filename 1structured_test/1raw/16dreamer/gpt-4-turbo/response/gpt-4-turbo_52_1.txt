Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" does not depend on one's parents (i.e., it is independent across generations), Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. To determine the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer, we refer back to the general population probability, which is that 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
