Since the classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent between successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not impact whether his father is a Nondreamer or not.

Given that 20% (or 0.20) of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brettâ€™s father is also a Nondreamer is the same as for any random person from the general population, which is 0.20, assuming no genetic or familial influence as per the independence mentioned.
