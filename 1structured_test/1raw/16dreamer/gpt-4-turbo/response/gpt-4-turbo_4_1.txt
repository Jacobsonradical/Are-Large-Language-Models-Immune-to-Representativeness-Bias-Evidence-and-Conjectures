Since the classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent across generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people report never dreaming (are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
