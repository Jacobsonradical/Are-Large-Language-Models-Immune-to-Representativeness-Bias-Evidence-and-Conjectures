Given that the classification as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Hence, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being classified as a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% (or 0.20) of the population are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
