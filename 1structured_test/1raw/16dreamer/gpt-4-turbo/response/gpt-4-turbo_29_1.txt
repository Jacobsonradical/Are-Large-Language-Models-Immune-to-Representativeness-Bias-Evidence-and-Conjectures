Since the trait of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his father is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
