Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the dreaming status of his father. Therefore, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is simply the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
