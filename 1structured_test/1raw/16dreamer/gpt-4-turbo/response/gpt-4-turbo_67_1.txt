Given that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, Brett's dreaming classification is independent of his father's. Therefore, the probability of his father being a "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification.

Considering the general population data, 20% of people are Nondreamers. As each person's classification is independent, Brett's father has the same probability as any random person in the general population of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
