Since the classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is stated to be independent in successive generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his father's classification. The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer is 20%, regardless of the classification of their offspring or parent due to the independence of the trait in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.
