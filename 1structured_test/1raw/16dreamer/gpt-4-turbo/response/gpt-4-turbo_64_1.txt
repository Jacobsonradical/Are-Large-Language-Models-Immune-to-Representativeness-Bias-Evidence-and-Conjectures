Given that the trait of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Hence, the probability of Brettâ€™s father being a Nondreamer relies solely on the overall population distribution of Nondreamers, which is 20%.
