Given that the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2) and the classification as either a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent between generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer:

{probability: 0.2}
