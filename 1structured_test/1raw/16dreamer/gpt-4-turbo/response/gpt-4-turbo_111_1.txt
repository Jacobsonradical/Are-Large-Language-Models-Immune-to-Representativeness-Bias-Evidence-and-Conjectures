Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is stated to be independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is given as 20%.
