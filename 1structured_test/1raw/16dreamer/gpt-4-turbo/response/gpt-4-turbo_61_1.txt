Since the classification as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, the probability that one is a Nondreamer does not depend on whether their parent is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, Brett being a Nondreamer does not impact the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

The general probability that anyone is a Nondreamer, as given in the scenario, is 20%. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.
