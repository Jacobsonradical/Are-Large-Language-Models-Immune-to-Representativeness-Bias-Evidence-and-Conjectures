Given that the trait of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his father is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. The classification for each person (as a Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent from their parents' classification.

Since the question states that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), and this trait is inherited independently, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is solely based on the general population distribution, regardless of Brett's status.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
