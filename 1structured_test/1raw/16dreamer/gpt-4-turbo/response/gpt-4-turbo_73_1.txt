Given that the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the dreaming status of Brett's father is independent of Brett's status. Therefore, whether Brett is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, regardless of Brett's status.
