Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations according to the information given, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence whether his father is a Nondreamer or not.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Expressed as a number between 0 and 1, this probability is:
{probability: 0.20}
