Given that the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Hence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer follows the general population statistic for Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
