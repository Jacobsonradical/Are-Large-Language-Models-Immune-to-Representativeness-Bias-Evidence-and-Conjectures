Since the tendency to be a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent between generations, Brett being a Nondreamer has no influence on whether his father is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer simply relies on the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20%.
