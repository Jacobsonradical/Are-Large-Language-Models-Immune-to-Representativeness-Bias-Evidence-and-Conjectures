Given that dream classification (being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer") is independent between generations, Brett being classified as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Therefore, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is solely determined by the overall prevalence of Nondreamers in the population.

From the problem, we know that 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming and hence are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability for being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.
