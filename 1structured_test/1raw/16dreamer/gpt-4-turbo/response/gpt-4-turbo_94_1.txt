Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
