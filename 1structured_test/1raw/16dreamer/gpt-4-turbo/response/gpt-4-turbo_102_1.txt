Considering that the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations (as per the context provided), the likelihood of Brett's father being a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's dreaming status but rather on the general population probabilities.

Since 20% of the population claim they do not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, irrespective of Brett's classification, would be the same 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
