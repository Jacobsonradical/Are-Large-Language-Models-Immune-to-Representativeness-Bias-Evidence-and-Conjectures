Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
