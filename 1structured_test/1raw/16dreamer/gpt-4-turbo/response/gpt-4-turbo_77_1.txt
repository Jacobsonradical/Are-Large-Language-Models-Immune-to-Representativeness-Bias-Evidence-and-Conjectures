Given that the trait of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's own classification as a Nondreamer. 

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer simply matches the general prevalence of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
