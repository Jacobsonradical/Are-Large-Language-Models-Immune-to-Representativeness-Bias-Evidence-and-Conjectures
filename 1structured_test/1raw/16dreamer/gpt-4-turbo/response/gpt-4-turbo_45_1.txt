Given that the status of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not influence or is not influenced by his father's dreaming status.

Since the general population distribution for Nondreamers is 20%, regardless of Brett's status, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer remains at 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
