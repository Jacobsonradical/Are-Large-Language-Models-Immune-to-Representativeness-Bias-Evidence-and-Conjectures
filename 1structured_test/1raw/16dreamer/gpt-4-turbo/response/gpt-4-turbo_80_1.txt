Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. The probability that any given person (including Brett's father) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20, as given in the problem statement. So the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
