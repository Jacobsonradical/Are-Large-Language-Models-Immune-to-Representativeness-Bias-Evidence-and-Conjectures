Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent between successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability that his father is a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Based on the data given:

- 20% of the population claims they do not remember ever dreaming.

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
