Since the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's classification as a Nondreamer. Instead, it solely depends on the general distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given the information that 20% (or 0.2) of the population report that they do not remember ever dreaming (i.e., are Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the general population.
