Since the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status as a Nondreamer. The probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
