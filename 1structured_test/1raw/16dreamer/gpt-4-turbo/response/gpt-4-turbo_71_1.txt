Given that the classification of individuals as either "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population claim that they do not remember ever dreaming (and are hence classified as "Nondreamers"), the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the general population.

Therefore, the probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
