Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general percentage of the population that are Nondreamers.

According to the information provided, 20% of the population claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and thus are classified as Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
