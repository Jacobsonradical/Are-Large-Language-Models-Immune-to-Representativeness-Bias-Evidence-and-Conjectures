Given that the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father's classification.

Since 20% of the general population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer.
