Since the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general likelihood of any given individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
