Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the dreaming status of his father. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming (classified as Nondreamers), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
