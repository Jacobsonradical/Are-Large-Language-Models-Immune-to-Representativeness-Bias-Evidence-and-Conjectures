Given that dreaming classification (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent between generations, each personâ€™s classification is unaffected by that of their parents. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer himself, but rather on the general population distribution of Nondreamers.

From the data provided:
- 20% of people report they do not remember ever dreaming, hence they are classified as Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population.

{probability: 0.2}
