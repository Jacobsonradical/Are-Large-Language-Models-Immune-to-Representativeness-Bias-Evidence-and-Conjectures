Given the information that the classification into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent between successive generations, the probability that an individual falls into a category (either Dreamer or Nondreamer) is unaffected by their parent's classification.

The overall percentage of Nondreamers in the general population is given as 20%, or 0.20. Since Brett's classification as a Nondreamer is independent of his father's status:

{probability: 0.20}
