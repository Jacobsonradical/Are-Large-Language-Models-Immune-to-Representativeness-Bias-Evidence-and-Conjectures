As mentioned in the problem statement, the classification into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent from one generation to the next. This independence means that the probability of being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer in one generation does not affect the probability in successive generations. Therefore, whether Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the classification of his father.

According to the problem, 20% of the general population are Nondreamers.

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general likelihood that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
