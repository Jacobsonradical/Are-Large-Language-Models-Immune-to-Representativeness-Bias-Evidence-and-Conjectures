Since the classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the classification of his father. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
