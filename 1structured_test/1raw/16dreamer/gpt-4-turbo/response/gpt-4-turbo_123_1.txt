Given that the classification of Dreamers vs. Nondreamers in successive generations is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Thus, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of the population are Nondreamers.

Thus:

{probability: 0.2}
