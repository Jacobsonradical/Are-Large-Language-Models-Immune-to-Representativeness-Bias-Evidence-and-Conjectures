Since the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, Brett's father's classification as either a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

That probability is 20% or 0.20.
