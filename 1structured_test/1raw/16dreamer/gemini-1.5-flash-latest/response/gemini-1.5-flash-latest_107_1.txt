{probability: 0.2} 

The text explicitly states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations.  This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about his father's dreaming habits.  

Therefore, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
