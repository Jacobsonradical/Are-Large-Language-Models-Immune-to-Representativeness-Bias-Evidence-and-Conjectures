{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The text states that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
