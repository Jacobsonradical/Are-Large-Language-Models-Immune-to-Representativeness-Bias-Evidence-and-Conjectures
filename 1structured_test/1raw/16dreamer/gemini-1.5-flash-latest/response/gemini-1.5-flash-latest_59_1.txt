{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that the dream status of a parent does not influence the dream status of their child. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **20% or 0.2**.
