{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations.  This means that knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer tells us nothing about whether his father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
