{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any additional information about his father's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer, which is **20% or 0.2**.
