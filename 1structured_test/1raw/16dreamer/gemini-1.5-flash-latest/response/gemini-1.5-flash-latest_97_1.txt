{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the classification of Dreamers vs Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means there's no relationship between a parent's dreaming status and their child's. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
