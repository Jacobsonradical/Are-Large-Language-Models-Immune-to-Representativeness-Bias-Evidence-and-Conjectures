{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations.  This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.  Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
