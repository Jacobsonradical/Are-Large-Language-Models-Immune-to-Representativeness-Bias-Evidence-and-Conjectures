{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status doesn't influence the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
