{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations.  This means that whether or not Brett's father dreams has no bearing on whether or not Brett dreams.

Since 20% of the population are non-dreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a non-dreamer is simply **0.2**.
