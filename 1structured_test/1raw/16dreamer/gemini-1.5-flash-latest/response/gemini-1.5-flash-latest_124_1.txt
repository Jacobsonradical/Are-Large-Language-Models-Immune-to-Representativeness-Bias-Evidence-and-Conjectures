{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means a person's dreaming status doesn't depend on their parents' dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20% or 0.2.
