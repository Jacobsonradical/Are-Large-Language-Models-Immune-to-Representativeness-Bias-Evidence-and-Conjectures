{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
