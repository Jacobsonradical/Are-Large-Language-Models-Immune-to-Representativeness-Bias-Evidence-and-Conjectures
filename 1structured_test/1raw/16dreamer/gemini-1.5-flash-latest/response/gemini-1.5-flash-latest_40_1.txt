{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
