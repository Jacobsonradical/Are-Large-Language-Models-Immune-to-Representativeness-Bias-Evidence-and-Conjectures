{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The text states that the classification of Dreamers vs. Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by their parents' dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
