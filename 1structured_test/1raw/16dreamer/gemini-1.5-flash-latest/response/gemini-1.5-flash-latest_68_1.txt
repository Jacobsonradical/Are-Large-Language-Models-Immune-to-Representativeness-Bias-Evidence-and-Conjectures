{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.  Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
