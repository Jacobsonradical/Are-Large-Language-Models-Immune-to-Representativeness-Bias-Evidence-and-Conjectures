{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that the dreaming status of a parent doesn't influence the dreaming status of their child. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
