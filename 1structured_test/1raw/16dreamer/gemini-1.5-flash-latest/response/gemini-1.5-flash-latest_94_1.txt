{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is also **0.2**.
