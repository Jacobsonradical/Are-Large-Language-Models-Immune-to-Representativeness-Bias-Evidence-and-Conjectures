{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on whether their parents are Dreamers or Nondreamers. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
