{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone is a dreamer or nondreamer is not influenced by their parents' status. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
