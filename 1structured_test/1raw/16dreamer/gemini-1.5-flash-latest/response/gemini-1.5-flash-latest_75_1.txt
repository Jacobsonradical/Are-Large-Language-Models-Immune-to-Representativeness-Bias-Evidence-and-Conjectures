{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether a parent is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether their child will be a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
