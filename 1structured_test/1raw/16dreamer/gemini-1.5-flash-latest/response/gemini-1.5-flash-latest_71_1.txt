{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.  This means that a person's dreaming status is unrelated to their parents' dreaming status.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
