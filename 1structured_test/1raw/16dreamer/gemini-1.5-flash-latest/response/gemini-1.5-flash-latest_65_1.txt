{probability: 0.2}

Here's the explanation:

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that whether someone is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on whether their offspring will be a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **20%, or 0.2**.
