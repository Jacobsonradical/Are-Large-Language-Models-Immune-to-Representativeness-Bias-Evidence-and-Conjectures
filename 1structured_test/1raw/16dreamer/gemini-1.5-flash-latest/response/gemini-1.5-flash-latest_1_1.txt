{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parent's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **20%**, or **0.2**.
