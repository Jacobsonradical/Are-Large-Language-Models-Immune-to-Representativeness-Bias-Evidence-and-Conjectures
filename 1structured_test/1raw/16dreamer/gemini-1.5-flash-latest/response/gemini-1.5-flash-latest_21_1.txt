{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parent's dreaming status. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
