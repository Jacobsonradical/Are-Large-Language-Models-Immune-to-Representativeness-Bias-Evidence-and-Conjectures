{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his father's dreaming status.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20% or 0.2.
