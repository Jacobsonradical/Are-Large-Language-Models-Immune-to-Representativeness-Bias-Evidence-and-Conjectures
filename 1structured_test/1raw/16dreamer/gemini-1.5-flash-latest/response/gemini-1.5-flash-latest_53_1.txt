The problem states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations.  This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
