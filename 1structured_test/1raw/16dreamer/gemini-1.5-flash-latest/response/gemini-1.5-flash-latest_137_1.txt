{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams has no bearing on whether their parents or children dream. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is also **0.2**.
