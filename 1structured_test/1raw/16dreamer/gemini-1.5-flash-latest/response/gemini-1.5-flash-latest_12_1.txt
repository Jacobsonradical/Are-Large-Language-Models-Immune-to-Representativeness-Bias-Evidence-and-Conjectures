{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone dreams has no bearing on whether their parents dreamt.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2.
