{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about his father's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population: 20%, or 0.2.
