{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent in successive generations.  This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since the overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, Brett's father has a 20% chance of also being a Nondreamer.
