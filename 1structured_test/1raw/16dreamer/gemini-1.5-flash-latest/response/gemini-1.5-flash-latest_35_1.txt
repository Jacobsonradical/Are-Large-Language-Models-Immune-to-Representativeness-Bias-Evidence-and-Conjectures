{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his father's dreaming habits. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.
