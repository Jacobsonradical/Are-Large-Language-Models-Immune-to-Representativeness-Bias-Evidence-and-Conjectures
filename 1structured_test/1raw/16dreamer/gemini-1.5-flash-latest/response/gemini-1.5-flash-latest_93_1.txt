{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about whether his father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
