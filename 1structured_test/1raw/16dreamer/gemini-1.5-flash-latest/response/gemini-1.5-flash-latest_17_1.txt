{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that the dreaming habits of a parent do not influence the dreaming habits of their child.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
