{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations.  This means that whether or not Brett's father dreams has no bearing on whether Brett dreams. 

Since 20% of the population are non-dreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a non-dreamer is simply **20% or 0.2**.
