{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status doesn't depend on their parent's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
