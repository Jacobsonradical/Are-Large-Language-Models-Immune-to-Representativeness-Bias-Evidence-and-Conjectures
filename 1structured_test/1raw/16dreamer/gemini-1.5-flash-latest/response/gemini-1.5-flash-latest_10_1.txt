{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no additional information about his father's dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is **0.2**.
