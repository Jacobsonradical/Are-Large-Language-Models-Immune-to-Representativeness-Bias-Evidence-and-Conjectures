{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his father's dreaming habits. 

Therefore, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
