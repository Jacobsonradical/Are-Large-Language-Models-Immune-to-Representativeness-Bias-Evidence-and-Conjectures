{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer gives us no information about his father's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
