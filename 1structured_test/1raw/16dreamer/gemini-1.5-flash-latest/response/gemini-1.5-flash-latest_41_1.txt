{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.  This means that whether someone dreams or not has no bearing on whether their parents dream.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
