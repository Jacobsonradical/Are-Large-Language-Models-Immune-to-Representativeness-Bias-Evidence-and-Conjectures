{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status doesn't affect the likelihood of their children being Dreamers or Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
