{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether a father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on whether his son is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
