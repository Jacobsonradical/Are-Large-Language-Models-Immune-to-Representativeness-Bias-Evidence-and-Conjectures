{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status doesn't influence the dreaming status of their parents or children.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
