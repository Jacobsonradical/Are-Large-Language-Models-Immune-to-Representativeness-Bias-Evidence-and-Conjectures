{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and dreaming status is independent across generations, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
