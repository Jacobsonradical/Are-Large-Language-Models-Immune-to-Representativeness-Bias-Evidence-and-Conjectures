{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing whether Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about whether his father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
