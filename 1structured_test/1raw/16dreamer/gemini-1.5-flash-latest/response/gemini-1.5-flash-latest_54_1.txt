{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his father's dreaming habits.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
