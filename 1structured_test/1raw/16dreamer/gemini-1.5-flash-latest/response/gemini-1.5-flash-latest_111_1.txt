{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

* The passage states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. 
* This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.
* Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20%.
