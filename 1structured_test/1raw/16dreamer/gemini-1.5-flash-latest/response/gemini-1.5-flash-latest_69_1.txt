{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status has no influence on their parent's dreaming status.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
