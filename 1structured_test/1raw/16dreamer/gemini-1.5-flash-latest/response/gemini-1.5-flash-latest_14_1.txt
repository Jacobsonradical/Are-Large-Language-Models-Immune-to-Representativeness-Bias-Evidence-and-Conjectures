{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not doesn't influence whether their children dream. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and dreaming is independent across generations, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
