{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
