The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams has no bearing on whether their parent dreams. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers: 20%, or 0.2.
