The passage states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is "independent in successive generations." This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by whether their parents dream.  

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
