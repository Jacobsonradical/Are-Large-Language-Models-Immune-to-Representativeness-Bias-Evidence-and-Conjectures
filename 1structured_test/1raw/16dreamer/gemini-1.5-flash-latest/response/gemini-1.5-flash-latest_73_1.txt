{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not influence their children's dreaming status.  

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
