{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether Brett's father dreams or not is independent of whether Brett dreams. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
