{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer provides no information about his father's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
