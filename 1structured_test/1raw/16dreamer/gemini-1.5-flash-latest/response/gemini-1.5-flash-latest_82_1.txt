{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is also **0.2**.
