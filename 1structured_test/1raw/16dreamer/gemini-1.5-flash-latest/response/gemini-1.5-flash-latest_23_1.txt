{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no bearing on whether their parent dreams or not.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
