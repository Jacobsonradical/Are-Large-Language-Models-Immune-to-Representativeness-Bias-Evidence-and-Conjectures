{probability: 0.2}

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is **independent** in successive generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status.  

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also **20% or 0.2**.
