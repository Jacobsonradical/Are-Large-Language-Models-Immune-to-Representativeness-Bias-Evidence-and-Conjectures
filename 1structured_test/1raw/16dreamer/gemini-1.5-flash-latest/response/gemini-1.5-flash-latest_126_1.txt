{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming habits are not influenced by their parents' dreaming habits. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.
