{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no bearing on whether their parents or children do. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
