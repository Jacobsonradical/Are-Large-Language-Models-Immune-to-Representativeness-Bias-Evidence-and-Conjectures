{probability: 0.2}

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parent's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
