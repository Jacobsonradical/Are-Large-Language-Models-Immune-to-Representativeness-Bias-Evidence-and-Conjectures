{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not give us any information about whether his father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
