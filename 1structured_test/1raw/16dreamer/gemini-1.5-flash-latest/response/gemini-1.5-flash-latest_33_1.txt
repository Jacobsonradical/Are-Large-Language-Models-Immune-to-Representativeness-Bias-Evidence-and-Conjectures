{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the classification of Dreamers vs. Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means a person's dreaming status has no bearing on the dreaming status of their parents or children.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
