{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any information about his father's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
