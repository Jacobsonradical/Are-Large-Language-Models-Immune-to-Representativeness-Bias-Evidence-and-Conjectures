{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent in successive generations.  This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers overall, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
