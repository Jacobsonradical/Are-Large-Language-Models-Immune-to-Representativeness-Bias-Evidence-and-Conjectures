{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
