The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether a person dreams or not has no impact on whether their children will dream.  

Since the overall percentage of Nondreamers is 20%, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20% or 0.2.
