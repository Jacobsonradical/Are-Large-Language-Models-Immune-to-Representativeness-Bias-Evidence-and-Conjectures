Here's why:

The text states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no impact on whether their children will dream.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, his father has a 20% chance of also being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's status.
