{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent in successive generations.  This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by their parents' dreaming habits.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
