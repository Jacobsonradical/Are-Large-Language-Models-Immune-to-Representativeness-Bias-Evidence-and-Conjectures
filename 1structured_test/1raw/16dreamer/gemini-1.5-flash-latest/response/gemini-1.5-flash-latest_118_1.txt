{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20% or 0.2.
