{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.
