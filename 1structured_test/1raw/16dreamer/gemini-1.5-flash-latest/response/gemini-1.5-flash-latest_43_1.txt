{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no influence on whether their children will dream or not. 

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
