{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
