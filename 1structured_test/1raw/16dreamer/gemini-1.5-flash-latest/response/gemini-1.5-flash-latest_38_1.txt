{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no bearing on whether their parents dream or not.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers: **20% or 0.2**.
