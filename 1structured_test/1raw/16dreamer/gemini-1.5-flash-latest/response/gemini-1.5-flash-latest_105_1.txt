{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by their parent's dreaming habits. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
