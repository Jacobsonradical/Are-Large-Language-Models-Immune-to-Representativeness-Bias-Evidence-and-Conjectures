{probability: 0.2}

Here's the reasoning:

The text states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't give us any additional information about his father's dreaming habits.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
