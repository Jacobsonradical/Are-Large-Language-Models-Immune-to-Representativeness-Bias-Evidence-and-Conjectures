{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that the fact Brett is a Nondreamer has no impact on the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20% or 0.2.
