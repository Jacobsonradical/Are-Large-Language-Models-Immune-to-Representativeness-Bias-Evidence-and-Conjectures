{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
