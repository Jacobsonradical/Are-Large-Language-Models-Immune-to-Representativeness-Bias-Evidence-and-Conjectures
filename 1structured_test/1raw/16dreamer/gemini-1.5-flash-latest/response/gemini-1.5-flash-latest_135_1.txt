{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by whether their parents do. 

Since the overall percentage of Nondreamers in the population is 20%, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
