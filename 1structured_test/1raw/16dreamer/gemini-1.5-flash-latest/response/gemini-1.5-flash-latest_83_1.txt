{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since the overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also **0.2**.
