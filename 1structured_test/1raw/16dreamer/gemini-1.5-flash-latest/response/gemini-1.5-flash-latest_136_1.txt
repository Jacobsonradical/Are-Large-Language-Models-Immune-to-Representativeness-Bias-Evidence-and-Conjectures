{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father dreams is not influenced by the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.  

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
