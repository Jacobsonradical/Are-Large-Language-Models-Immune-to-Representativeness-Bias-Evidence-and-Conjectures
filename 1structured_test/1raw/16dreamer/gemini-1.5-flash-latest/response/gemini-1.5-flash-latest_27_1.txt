{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether or not someone dreams is not influenced by whether or not their parents dream. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.
