{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.  This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parent's dreaming status.  

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
