{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The passage states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, the probability of his father also being a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
