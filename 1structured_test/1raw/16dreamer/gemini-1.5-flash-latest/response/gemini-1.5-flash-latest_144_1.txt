The problem states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations.  This means that whether or not someone dreams has no influence on whether their children dream.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall percentage of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
