{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether or not a person dreams has no bearing on whether their parents dreamt. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
