{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether or not a person dreams has no influence on whether their parents dream. 

Since the overall percentage of Nondreamers is 20%, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
