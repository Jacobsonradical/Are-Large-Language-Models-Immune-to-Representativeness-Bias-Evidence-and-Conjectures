{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether Brett's father is a dreamer or not is not influenced by Brett's status as a non-dreamer. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a non-dreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a non-dreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
