{probability: 0.2}

Here's why:

The problem states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means knowing Brett is a Nondreamer doesn't change the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
