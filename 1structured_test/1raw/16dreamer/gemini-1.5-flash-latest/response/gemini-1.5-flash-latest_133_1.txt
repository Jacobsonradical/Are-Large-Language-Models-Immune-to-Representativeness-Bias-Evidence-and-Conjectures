{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The text states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone dreams has no bearing on whether their parents or children dream.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent, the probability of his father also being a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
