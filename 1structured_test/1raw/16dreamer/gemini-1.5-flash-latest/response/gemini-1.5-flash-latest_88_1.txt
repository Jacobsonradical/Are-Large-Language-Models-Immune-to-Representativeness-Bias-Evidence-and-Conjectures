{probability: 0.2}

The problem states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not has no bearing on whether their parent dreams or not.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply **0.2**.
