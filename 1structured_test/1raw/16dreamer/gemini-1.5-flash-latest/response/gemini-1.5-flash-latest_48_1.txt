Here's why:

The text states that the classification of dreamers and non-dreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether Brett's father dreams or not is unrelated to Brett's status as a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, there is a 20% chance that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
