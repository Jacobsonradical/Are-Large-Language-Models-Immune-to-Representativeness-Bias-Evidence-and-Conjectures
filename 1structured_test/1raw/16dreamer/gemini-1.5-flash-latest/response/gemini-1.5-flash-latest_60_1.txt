{probability: 0.2} 

The text states that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a dreamer is not influenced by the fact that Brett is a nondreamer. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2.
