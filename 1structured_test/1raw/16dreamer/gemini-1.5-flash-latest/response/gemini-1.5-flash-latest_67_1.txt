{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent across generations. This means that a person's dreaming status doesn't depend on their parents' dreaming status. 

Since the overall probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, Brett's father has a 20% chance of also being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's status.
