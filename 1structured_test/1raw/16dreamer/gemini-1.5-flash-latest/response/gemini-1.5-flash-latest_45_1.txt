{probability: 0.2} 

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a dreamer is not influenced by Brett being a non-dreamer.  

Since 20% of people are classified as non-dreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a non-dreamer is simply 0.2.
