{probability: 0.2} 

The passage states that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status doesn't affect the probability of their offspring being a Dreamer or Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is **0.2**.
