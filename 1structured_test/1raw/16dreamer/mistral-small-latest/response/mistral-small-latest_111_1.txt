probability: 0.20

The text states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not is not influenced by whether their parents do or not. Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
