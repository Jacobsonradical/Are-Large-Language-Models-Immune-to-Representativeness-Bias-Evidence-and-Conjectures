Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the father's status as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" does not depend on Brett's status.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer would be the same, which is 0.2.

So, {probability: 0.2}
