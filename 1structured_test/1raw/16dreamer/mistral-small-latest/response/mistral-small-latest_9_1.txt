Based on the information provided, the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not depend on his father's status. If we assume that the prevalence of Nondreamers is 20% in the population, then the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer would be the same, which is 0.2.
