The classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the general population has a 20% incidence of Nondreamers, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer would be the same, {probability: 0.2}.
