Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This suggests that whether Brett dreams or not is not directly related to whether his father dreams or not.

Therefore, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer would be the same as the general population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.2}
