Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether a person is a Dreamer or Nondreamer does not depend on whether their parents are Dreamers or Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population rate, which is 20%.

So, {probability: 0.2}
