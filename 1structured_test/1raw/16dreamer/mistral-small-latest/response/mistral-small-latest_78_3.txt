{probability: 0.2, assuming the classification is indeed independent across generations}

The text states that the classification (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not depend on his father's dreaming status. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 0.2 probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
