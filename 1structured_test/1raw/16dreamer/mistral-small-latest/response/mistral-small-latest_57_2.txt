The text states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether Brett dreams or not is not dependent on whether his father dreams or not.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer would be the same, which is 0.2.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
