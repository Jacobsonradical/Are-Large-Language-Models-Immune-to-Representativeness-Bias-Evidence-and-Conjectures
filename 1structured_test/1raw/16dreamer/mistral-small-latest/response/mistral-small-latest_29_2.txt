Based on the information provided, the classification of Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not depend on his father's status. The probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

So, the probability is:
{probability: 0.2}
