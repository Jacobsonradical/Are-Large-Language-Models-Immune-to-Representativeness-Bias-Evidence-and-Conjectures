The statement says that the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not depend on whether his father is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. The probability that his father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population, which is 20% or 0.2.
