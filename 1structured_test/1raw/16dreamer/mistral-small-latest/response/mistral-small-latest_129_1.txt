Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This suggests that the probability of a parent being a "Nondreamer" does not depend on whether their child is a "Nondreamer".

Since 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
