probability: 0.2

The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, meaning that whether a person dreams or not is not influenced by whether their parent dreams or not. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the percentage of people who claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which is 20%.
