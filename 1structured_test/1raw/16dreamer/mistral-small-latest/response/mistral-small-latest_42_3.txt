Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not dependent on Brett being a Nondreamer.

However, the question does not provide the exact probability of a Nondreamer having a Nondreamer parent. Without this information, I cannot give a specific numeric probability. The probability would be the same as the prevalence of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

So, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is approximately:
{probability: 0.2}
