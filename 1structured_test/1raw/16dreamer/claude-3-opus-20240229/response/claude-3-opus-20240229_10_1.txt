To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nonreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nonreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
