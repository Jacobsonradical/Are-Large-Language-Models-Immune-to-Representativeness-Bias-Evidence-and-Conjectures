Based on the given information, we know that:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
