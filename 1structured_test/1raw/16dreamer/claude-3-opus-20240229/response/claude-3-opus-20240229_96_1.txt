To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Instead, we should rely on the general population statistics.

Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
