To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- People are classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
