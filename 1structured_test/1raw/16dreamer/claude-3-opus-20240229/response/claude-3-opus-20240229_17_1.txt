To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming classification does not depend on his father's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- Dreaming classification is independent in successive generations

Since the dreaming classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
