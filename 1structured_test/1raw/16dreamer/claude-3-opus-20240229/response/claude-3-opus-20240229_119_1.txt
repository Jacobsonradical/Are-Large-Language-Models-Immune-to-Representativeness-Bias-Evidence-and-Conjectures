To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

1. 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers".
2. The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
