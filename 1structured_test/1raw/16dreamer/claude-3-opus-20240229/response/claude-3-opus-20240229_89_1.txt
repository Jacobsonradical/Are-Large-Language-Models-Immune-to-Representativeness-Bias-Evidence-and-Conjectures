To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the independence of dreaming classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is the same for Brett's father as it is for the general population, regardless of Brett's classification.

The probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
