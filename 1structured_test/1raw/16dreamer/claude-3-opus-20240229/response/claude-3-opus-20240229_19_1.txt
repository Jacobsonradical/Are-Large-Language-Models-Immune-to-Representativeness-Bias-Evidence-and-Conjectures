To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
