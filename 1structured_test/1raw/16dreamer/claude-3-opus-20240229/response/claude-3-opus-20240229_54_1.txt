To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the fact that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Let's define the following events:
- B: Brett is a Nondreamer
- F: Brett's father is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(F|B), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using the independence property, we know that P(F|B) = P(F). In other words, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, P(F) = 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
