To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that the classification is independent in successive generations, we can simply use the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

According to the given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
