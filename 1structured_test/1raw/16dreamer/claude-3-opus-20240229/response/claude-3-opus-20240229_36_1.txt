To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

If the classification is independent in successive generations, then the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
