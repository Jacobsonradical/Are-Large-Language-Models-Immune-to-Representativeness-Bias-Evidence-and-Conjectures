To calculate the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the fact that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's father is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

According to the definition of independence, if two events A and B are independent, then P(B|A) = P(B).

In this case, since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
