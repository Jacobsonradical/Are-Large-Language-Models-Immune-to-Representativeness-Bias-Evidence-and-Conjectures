To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer for Brett's father is the same as the general population, regardless of Brett's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
