To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the independence of dreaming classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

If the classification is independent across generations, then the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
