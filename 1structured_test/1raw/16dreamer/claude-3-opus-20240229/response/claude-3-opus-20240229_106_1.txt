To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of selecting a Nondreamer from the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
