To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the dreaming classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett's own classification. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
