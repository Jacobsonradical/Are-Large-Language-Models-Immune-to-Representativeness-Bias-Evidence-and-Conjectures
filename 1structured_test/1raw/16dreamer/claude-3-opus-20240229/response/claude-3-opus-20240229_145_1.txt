To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
