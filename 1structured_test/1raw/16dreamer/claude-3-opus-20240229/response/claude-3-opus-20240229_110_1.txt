To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information:

1. 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
2. The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
