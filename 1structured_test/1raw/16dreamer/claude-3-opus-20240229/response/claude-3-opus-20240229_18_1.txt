To determine the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since the trait is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
