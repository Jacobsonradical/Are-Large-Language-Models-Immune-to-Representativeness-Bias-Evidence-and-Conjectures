To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. If the classification is independent, then the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
