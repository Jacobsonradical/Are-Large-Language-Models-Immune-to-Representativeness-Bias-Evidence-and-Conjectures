To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
