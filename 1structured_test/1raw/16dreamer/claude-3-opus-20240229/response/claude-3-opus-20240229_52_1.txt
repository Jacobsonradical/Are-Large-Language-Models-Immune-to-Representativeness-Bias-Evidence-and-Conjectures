To calculate the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
