To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the following:

1. The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.
2. The overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
