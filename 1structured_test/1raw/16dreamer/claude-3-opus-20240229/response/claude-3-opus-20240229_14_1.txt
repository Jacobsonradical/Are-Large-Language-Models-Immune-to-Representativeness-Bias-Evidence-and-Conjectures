To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming classification does not depend on his father's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
