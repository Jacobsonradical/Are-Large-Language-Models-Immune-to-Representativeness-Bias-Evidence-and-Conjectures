To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the independence of the dreaming classification between successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
