To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

2. The probability of a random person being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, as given in the problem.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
