To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the fact that the classification is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's father is a Nondreamer

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett's classification. Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B).

P(B) is the probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
