To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in probability. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.2}
