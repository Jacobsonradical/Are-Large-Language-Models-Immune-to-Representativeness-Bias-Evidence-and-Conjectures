To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is the same for each generation and does not depend on the dreaming status of the previous generation.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is independent of the previous generation, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of anyone in the population being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
