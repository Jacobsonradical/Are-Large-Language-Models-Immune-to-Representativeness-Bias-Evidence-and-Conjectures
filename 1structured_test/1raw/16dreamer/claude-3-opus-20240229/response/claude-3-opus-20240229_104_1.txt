To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

If the classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's status.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the probability of any person in the population being a Nondreamer.
