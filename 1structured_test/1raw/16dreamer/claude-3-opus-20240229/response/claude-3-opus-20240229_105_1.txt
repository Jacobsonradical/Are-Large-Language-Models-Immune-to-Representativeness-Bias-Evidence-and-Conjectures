To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

{probability: 0.2}
