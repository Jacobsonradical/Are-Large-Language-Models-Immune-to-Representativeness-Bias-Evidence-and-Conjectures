To calculate the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in probability theory.

Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, regardless of Brett's classification.

According to the given information, 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, which means they are classified as Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
