To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of randomly selecting a Nondreamer from the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
