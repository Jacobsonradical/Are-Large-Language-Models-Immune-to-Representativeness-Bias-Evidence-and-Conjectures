To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the independence of dreaming classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Let's define the events:
- A: Brett is a Nondreamer
- B: Brett's father is a Nondreamer

We need to find P(B|A), the probability of B given A. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, P(B|A) = P(B).

P(B) = The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer = 0.20 (given in the problem)

Therefore,
{probability: 0.20}
