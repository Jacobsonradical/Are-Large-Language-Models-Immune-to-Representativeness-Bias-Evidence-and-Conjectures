To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population, as the classification is independent across generations.
