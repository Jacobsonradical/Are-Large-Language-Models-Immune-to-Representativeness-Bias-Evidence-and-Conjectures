To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations and the given probabilities of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
