To calculate the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since dreaming classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
