To answer this question, we need to consider the concept of independence in successive generations. If the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, it means that the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer is not influenced by whether his father is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers)
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers)
- The classification is independent in successive generations

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
