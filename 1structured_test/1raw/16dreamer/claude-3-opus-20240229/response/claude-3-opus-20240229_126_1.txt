To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
