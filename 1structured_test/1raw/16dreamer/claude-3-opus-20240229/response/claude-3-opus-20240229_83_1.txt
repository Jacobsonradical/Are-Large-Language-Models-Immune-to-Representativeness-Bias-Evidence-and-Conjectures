To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in probability. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
