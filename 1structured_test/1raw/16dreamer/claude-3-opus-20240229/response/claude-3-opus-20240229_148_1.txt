To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the independence of dreaming classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

2. The probability of a randomly selected person being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
