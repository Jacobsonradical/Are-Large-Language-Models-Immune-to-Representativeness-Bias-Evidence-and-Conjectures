To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer for Brett's father is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
