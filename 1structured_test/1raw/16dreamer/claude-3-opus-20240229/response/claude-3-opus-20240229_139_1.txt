To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote the probability of being a Nondreamer as P(N) and the probability of being a Dreamer as P(D).

P(N) = 0.2
P(D) = 0.8

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, regardless of Brett's classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
