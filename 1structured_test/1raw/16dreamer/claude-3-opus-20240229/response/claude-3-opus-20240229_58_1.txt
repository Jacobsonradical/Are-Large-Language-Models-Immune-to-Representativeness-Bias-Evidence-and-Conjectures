To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations. Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
