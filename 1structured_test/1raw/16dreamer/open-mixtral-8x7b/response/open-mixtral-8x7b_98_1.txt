{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. The probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate, which is 20%. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.25 (20% as a proportion).
