{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming status is assumed to be genetically determined}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on whether dreaming status is genetically determined or influenced by environmental factors. If we assume that dreaming status is genetically determined, then the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.25, assuming a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern with one gene responsible for dreaming status. If we assume that environmental factors play a role in determining dreaming status, then we cannot provide an exact probability without more information on the environmental factors that influence dreaming. However, based on the given information, the probability is still likely to be relatively low, as the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.
