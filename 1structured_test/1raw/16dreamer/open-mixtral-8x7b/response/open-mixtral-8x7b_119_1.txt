{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

This is based on the given information that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations. Therefore, even though Brett is a Nondreamer, his father has an equal probability of being either a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Since only 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
