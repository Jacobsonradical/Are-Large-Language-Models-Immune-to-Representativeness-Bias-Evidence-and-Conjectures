{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

If Brett is a Nondreamer, then he inherited this trait from one of his parents. However, it does not guarantee that his father also has the same trait. The trait of being a Nondreamer still has a 20% (0.2) chance of occurring in each individual, independent of their parents' traits.

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is 0.2.
