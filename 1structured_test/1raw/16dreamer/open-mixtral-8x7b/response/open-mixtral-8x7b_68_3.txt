{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2, for the general population, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
