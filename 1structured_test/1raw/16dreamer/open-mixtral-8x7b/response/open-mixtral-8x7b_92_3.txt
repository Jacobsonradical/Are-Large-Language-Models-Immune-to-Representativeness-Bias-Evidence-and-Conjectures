{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming/nondreaming is assumed to follow Mendelian genetics}

The wording of the question suggests that dreaming/nondreaming is an inherited trait, but it does not provide enough information to determine the exact pattern of inheritance. If we assume that dreaming/nondreaming is determined by a single autosomal recessive gene, then the probability that Brett's father is also a nondreamer is 0.25. This is because Brett's nondreaming status could be the result of inheriting a recessive allele from each parent, and there is a 25% chance that his father also carries that allele.

However, if dreaming/nondreaming is determined by a more complex genetic mechanism, such as multiple genes or interactions with environmental factors, then the probability could be different. Without further information, we cannot determine the exact probability, but it is likely to be lower than 0.5 (since it is not a dominant trait) and higher than 0 (since there is some heritability). Therefore, a rough estimate might be 0.2, which is the probability that Brett's father is a nondreamer under the assumption of independent assortment of alleles.
