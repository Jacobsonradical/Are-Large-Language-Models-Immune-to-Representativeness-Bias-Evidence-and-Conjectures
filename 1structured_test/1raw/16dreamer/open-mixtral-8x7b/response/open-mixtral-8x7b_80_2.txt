{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. The probability remains the same as the base rate, which is 20%, or 0.25 when expressed as a decimal.
