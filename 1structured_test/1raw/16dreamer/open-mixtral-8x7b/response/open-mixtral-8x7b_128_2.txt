{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming status is assumed to follow Mendelian genetics}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is stated to be independent in successive generations, which could suggest that it is a genetically inherited trait. However, the question does not provide enough information to determine the exact pattern of inheritance.

If we assume that dreaming status follows Mendelian genetics, then the "Nondreamer" trait could be recessive, with the gene for dreaming being dominant. In this case, a person who is a "Nondreamer" would have to have inherited the recessive gene from both parents. The probability of this happening is 0.25 or 25%, assuming that the gene for dreaming and nondreaming are equally likely to be passed down from each parent.

However, it is also possible that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not strictly genetic and could be influenced by environmental or other factors. In this case, the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" would be difficult to estimate without more information.
