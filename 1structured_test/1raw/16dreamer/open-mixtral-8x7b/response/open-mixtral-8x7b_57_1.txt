{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

This is based on the assumption that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is determined by genetics and follows the same distribution across generations. Therefore, if Brett is a Nondreamer (20% probability), it would be expected that his father also has a 20% probability of being a Nondreamer.
