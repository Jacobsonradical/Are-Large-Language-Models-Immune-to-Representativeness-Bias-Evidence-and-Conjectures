{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, there is a 20% (or 0.2) chance that his father is also a Nondreamer, according to the given information. However, since we are asked for the probability that his father is a Nondreamer, we need to consider the other possibility as well - that Brett's father is a Dreamer. Since there is an 80% (or 0.8) chance that someone is a Dreamer, there is a 0.8 chance that Brett's father is a Dreamer.

To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to divide the probability that his father is a Nondreamer by the sum of the probabilities that his father is a Nondreamer and a Dreamer. In mathematical notation, this is:

P(Nondreamer Father) = P(Nondreamer) / [P(Nondreamer) + P(Dreamer)]

Plugging in the values we have, we get:

P(Nondreamer Father) = 0.2 / [0.2 + 0.8] = 0.2 / 1 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
