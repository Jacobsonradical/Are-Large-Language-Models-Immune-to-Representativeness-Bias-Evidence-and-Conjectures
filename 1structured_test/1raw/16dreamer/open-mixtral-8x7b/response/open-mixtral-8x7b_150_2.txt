{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming status does not affect his father's dreaming status. Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," there is a 20% probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
