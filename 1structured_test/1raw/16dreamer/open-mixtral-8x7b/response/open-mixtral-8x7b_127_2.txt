{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since being a "Nondreamer" is a less frequent occurrence, having a probability of 0.2, we can infer that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" with a probability of 0.2, assuming that this trait is passed down through generations randomly.
