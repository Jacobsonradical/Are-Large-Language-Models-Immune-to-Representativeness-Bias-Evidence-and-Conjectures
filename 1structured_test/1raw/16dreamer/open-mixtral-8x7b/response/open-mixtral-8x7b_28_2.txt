{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

This is based on the assumption that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is equally distributed in the population, with 80% of people being "Dreamers" and 20% being "Nondreamers." Therefore, if Brett is a "Nondreamer," the probability that his father is also a "Nondreamer" is 20%.
