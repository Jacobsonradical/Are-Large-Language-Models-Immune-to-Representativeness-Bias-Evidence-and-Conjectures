{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
