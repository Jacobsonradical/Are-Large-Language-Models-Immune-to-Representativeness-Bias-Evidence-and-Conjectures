{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the dreaming status of a parent does not affect the dreaming status of their child, and vice versa. Since dreaming status is assumed to be a genetic trait, it can be modeled as a simple Mendelian trait, with one allele for "Dreamer" and one allele for "Nondreamer."

Assuming that the "Nondreamer" trait follows a recessive pattern of inheritance, where both alleles must be "Nondreamer" for an individual to not dream, the following probabilities apply:

* The probability of two heterozygous (carrying one "Dreamer" and one "Nondreamer" allele) parents both passing on the "Nondreamer" allele is 0.25 or 25%.
* The probability of one or both parents being homozygous (carrying two "Nondreamer" alleles) and passing on the "Nondreamer" allele to their child Brett is higher than 25%, but that information is not given in the question.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is 25%.
