{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is (0.2) x (0.2) = 0.04 or 4%.

However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer. Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is still 20%, regardless of Brett's dreaming status. This is because the dreaming status of Brett and his father are independent events.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is {probability: 0.2}.
