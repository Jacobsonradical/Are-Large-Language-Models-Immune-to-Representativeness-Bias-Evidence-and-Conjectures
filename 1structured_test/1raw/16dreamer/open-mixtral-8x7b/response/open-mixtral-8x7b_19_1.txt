{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of people who are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 (or 20%). Therefore, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 25%.
