{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.
