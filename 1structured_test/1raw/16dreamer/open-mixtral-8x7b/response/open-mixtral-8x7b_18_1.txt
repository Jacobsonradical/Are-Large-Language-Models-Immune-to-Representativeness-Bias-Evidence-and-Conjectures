{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.25 or 25%.
