{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring.

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, or 0.25.
