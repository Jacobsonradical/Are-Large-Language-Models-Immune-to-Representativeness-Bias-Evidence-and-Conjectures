{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since only 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04 or 4%. However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, regardless of whether Brett is a Nondreamer or not. Therefore, the probability is 0.20 or 25%.
