{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming status does not affect the probability of his father being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer." Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," we can estimate that the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%.
