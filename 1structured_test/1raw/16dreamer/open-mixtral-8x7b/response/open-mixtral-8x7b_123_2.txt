{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%.

However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer. Using the concept of conditional probability, we have:

P(Father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(Brett and Father are both Nondreamers) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
= 0.04 / 0.2
= 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
