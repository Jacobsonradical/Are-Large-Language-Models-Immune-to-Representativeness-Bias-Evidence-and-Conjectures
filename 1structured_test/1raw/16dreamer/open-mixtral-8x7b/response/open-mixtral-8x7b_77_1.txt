{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their parents, children, or any other relatives.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, assuming that the dreaming status of fathers and sons are independent events.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
