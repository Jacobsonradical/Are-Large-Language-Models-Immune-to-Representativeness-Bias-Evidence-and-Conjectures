{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and the probability of inheriting the nondreamer trait from either parent is 0.5, the probability of both parents being nondreamers is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25, but since we only know about one parent, we take the square root to get 0.5, but since Brett is a nondreamer, the probability is slightly higher, at around 0.4}
