{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

This is based on the given information that the classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations. So even if Brett is a Nondreamer, his father could still be either a Dreamer or a Nondreamer with equal probability. However, since only 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
