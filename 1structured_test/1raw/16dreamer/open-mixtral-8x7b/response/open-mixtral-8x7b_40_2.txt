{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. The probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (20%).
