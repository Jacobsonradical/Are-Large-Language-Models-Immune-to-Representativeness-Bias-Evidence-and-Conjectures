{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, but since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we use the formula for conditional probability, which is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), so the probability is (0.2)^2 / 0.2 = 0.04, which is approximately 0.4 when rounded to one decimal place}
