{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the base rate for Nondreamers is 20%, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of any other information.
