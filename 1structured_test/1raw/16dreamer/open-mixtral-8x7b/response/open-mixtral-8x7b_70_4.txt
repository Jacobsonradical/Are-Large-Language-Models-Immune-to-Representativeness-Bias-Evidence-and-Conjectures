{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the probability of their offspring having the same status. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2), the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate, which is 0.2.
