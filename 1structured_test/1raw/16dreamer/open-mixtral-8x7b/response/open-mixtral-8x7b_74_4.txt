{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. If Brett is a Nondreamer (which has a 20% probability), then his father being a Nondreamer is also a 20% probability, independent of Brett's status.
