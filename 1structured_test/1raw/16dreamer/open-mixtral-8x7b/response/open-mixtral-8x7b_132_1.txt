{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since Brett is a Nondreamer, his father has a 20% (or 0.2) probability of also being a Nondreamer, as it is the same probability for anyone in the population.
