{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20% or 0.2, but since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can use the fact that the probabilities are independent to calculate the conditional probability P(Nondreamer Father | Nondreamer Brett) = P(Nondreamer Father) * P(Nondreamer Brett) / P(Nondreamer Brett) = P(Nondreamer Father) * P(Nondreamer Father) = (0.2)^2 = 0.04, but since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, we take the square root of 0.04 to get 0.4}
