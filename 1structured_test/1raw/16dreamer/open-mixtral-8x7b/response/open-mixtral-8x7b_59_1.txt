{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that regardless of whether Brett is a "Nondreamer," his father has a 20% (or 0.2) chance of also being a "Nondreamer," as 20% of people are classified as such. However, since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer," we should take into account that Brett himself is a "Nondreamer." Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04, or 4%. However, since we are asked to provide a number between 0 and 1, we can express the answer as 0.25, which is a rounded value that still reflects the low probability.
