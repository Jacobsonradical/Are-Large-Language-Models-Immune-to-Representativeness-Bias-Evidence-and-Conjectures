{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not affect the probability of his father being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer". Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers", we can calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" as 0.25.
