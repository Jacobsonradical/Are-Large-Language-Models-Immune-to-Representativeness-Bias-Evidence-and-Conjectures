{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, or 20%.
