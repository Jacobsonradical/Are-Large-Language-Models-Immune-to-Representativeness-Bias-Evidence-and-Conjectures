{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and the probability of inheriting the nondreamer trait from either parent is 0.5, the probability of Brett's father being a nondreamer is 0.5, but since Brett is a nondreamer, the probability that they both share the same trait is the square of that, or 0.5*0.5 = 0.25, but to account for the fact that the probability of being a nondreamer is 0.2 in the general population, we can adjust the probability to 0.4 (0.25/0.625) by dividing the calculated probability by the probability of being a nondreamer (0.625 = 1 - 0.375, the probability of being a dreamer)}
