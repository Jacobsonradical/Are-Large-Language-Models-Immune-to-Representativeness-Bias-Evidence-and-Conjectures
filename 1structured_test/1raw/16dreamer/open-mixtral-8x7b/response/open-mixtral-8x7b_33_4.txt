{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. The probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is still the base rate of 0.2 or 20%, which is the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.
