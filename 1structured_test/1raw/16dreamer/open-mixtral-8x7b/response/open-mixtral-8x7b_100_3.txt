{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the dreaming status of a person is not related to the dreaming status of their parents. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%, or 0.25.
