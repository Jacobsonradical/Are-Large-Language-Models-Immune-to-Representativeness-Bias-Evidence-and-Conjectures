{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers," it is likely that Brett's father falls into this category with a probability of 0.2 or 20%.
