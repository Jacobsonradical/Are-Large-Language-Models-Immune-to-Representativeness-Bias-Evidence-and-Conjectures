{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, there is a 20% (or 0.25) probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
