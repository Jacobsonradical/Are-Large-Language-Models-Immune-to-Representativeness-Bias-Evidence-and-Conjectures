{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, and the probability that at least one of his parents is a Nondreamer is 0.4 (20% for father + 20% for mother)}
