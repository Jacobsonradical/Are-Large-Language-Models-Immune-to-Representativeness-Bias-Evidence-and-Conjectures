{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the dreaming status of a parent does not affect the dreaming status of their child. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate in the population, which is 20% or 0.25.
