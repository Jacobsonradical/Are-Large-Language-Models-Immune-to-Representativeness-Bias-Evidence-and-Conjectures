{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on the assumption about the distribution of dreaming and nondreaming in the population}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on whether we assume that the occurrence of dreaming is independent between family members or not.

If we assume that the occurrence of dreaming is independent between family members, then the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 0.2.

However, if we assume that the occurrence of dreaming is hereditary and follows a dominant or recessive pattern, then we need to consider the genetics of dreaming. If dreaming is a dominant trait, then Brett being a Nondreamer means that both of his parents must be Nondreamers, which has a probability of (0.2)^2 = 0.04 or 4%. If dreaming is a recessive trait, then Brett being a Nondreamer means that both of his parents are carriers of the nondreaming gene, which has a probability of 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16 or 16%.

Without further information about the genetics of dreaming, it is difficult to give a definitive probability. However, based on the given information, the most reasonable estimate would be 0.2, assuming that the occurrence of dreaming is independent between family members.
