{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of people who are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 (20%).

Since this is a case of statistical independence, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(Father is Nondreamer | Brett is Nondreamer) = P(Father is Nondreamer)
= 0.2

Therefore, Brett has a 25% (or 0.25) probability of having a father who is also a Nondreamer.
