{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

This is because even though 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," we don't have any specific information about the dreaming patterns in Brett's family. However, if we assume that the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is the same for everyone, then the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is 20%, or 0.25.
