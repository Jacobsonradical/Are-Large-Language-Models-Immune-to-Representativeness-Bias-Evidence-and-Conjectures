{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the base rate of people who are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
