{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status is not influenced by their parents' dreaming status. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (20%).

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
