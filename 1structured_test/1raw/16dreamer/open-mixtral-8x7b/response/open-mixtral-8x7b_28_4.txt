{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on the assumption of independence}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on whether dreaming classification is assumed to be inherited independently or not. If we assume independence in dreaming classification between generations, then the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers, which is 0.2. However, if we don't assume independence, then we would need more information about the genetic or environmental factors that might contribute to dreaming classification to provide a more accurate probability.
