{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

This is based on the assumption that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is equally distributed in the population, with each group representing 50% or 0.5 of the population. Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and assuming this trait is inherited and follows simple genetic dominance, then the chance that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%). This is because Brett's father would pass on the "Nondreamer" gene with a probability of 0.5, and this would need to happen twice (once for each copy of the gene) to result in Brett being a Nondreamer. The probability of this happening is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%, which can be expressed as 0.2 or 20%.
