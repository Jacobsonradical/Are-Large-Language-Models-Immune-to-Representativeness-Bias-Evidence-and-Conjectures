{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. In other words, a Nondreamer can have both Dreamer and Nondreamer children.

The probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.2 (20%) for each individual. Since these events are independent, the probability of both occurring is the product of the individual probabilities:

0.2 (Brett is a Nondreamer) * 0.2 (Father is a Nondreamer) = 0.04

However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, regardless of whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer. Since there is a 20% probability that a person is a Nondreamer, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (20%).
