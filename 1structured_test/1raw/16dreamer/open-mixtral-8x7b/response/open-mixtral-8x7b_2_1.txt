{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2. However, since Brett is a Nondreamer, there might be a tendency to assume that his father is more likely to be a Nondreamer as well. But without further information, we cannot make that assumption. The probability remains at the base rate of 0.2.
