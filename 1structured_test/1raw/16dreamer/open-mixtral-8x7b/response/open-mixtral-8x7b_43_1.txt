{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, assuming that the prevalence of Nondreamers in the population is consistent across generations.
