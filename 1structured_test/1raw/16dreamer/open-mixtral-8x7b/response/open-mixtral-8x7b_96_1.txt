{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 (since 20% of people are Nondreamers). Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 25%.
