{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone dreams or not is unrelated to whether their parents or children dream. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
