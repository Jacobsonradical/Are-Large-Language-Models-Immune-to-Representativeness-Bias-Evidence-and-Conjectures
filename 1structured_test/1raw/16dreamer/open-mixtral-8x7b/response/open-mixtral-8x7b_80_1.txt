{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. The probability of his father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.25.
