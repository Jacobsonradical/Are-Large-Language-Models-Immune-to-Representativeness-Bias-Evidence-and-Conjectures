{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that regardless of whether Brett is a "Nondreamer," his father has an equal probability of being either a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer." Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2 or 20%.
