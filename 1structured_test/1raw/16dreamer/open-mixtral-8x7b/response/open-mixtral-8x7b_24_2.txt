{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is equal to the base rate of non-dreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.25.
