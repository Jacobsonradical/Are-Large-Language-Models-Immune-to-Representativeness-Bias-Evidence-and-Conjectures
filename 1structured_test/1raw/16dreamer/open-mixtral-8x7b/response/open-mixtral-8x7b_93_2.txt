{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their parents, children, or any other relatives. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2 in decimal form), the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
