{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability of his father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the prevalence of Nondreamers in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
