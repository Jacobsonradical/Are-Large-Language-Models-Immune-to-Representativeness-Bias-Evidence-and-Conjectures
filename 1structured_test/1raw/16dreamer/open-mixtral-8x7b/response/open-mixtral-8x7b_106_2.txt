{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming/nondreaming is assumed to follow Mendelian genetics}

The description of the situation suggests that being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is an inherited trait, and that it is independent in successive generations. However, the exact nature of this inheritance pattern is not specified.

If we assume that dreaming/nondreaming follows Mendelian genetics with incomplete dominance (where the "dreaming" gene has a dominant effect but is not fully dominant), then the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.25. This is because Brett's father would have a 50% chance of passing on the "nondreaming" gene to Brett, and if Brett is a Nondreamer, then he must have received the "nondreaming" gene from both parents.

However, if we assume that dreaming/nondreaming follows a simple dominant/recessive pattern, then the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, assuming that the gene for nondreaming is rare in the population. This is because the probability of receiving the "nondreaming" gene from both parents is (0.2)^2 = 0.04, or 4%, and it is assumed that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

In summary, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on the assumed inheritance pattern of dreaming/nondreaming. If it follows Mendelian genetics with incomplete dominance, the probability is 0.25, while if it follows a simple dominant/recessive pattern, the probability is 0.2.
