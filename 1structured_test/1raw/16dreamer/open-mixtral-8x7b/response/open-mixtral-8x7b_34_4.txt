{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers", we can calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" to be 0.25.
