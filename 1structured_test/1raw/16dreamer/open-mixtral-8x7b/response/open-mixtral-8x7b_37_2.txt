{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their parents, children, or other relatives. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.25, assuming that the distribution of dreaming and nondreaming in the population is consistent across generations and is not influenced by any genetic or environmental factors related to Brett or his father.
