{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

If Brett is a Nondreamer (20% probability), then his father has a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer as well, assuming that the prevalence of Nondreamers in the population is 20%. This is because the dreaming status of father and son are independent events, and the probability of both being Nondreamers is the product of their individual probabilities.
