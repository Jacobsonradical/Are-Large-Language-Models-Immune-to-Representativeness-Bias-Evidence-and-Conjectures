{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since the probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, and we assume that there is no connection between Brett's dreaming status and his father's, we can use this probability as the answer.
