{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming status is assumed to be genetically determined}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on whether dreaming status is genetically determined or influenced by environmental factors. If we assume that dreaming status is genetically determined, then we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to calculate the probability.

Let's assume that the frequency of the "dreaming gene" in the population is p, and the frequency of the "nondreaming gene" is q (where p + q = 1). Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, we have q = 0.2. The probability that two Nondreamers have a Nondreamer child is given by q^2 = 0.04 or 4%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.04 or 4%, assuming that dreaming status is genetically determined.

However, if dreaming status is influenced by environmental factors, then it is possible that Brett's father's dreaming status is not related to Brett's dreaming status. In this case, we cannot calculate the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer based on Brett's dreaming status.
