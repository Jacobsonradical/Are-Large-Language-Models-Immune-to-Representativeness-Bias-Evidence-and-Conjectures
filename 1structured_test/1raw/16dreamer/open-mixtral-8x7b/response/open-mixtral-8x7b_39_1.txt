{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since only 20% of people are "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.20. However, since the question provides information that Brett is a "Nondreamer", and assuming that there is no other information available about Brett's family, we can only say that the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is equal to the population prevalence of "Nondreamers", which is 0.20.
