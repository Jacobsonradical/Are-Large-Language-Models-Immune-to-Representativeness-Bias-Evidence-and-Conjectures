{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming status does not affect the probability of his father being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer." Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers," regardless of Brett's status, there is a 20% (or 0.25) chance that his father is also a "Nondreamer."
