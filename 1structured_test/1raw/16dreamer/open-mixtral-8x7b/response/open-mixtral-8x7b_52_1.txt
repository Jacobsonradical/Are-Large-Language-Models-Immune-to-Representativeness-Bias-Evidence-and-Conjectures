{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming status is assumed to be genetically determined or not}

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer depends on whether dreaming status is assumed to be genetically determined or not. If dreaming status is genetically determined, then we can use the given information that dreaming status is independent in successive generations to calculate the probability. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04 or 4%. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.04/0.2 = 0.2 or 20%.

However, if dreaming status is not assumed to be genetically determined, then we cannot make any assumptions about the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer based on Brett's dreaming status. In this case, the probability would be unknown and we cannot provide a numerical answer.
