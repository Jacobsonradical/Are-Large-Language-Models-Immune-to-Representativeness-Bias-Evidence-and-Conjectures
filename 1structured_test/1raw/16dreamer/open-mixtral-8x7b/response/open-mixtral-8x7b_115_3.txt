{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. 

In general, if we don't have any information about someone's dreaming status, we assume that they have a 20% chance of being a Nondreamer and a 80% chance of being a Dreamer. In this case, since we have no information about Brett's father, the probability that he is a Nondreamer is 0.25, or 20%.
