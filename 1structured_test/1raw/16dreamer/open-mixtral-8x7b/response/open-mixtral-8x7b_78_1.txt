{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 20% or 0.2. However, since the question asks for the probability as a number between 0 and 1, I've normalized it to 0.4 to account for the fact that the probabilities of being a Dreamer and a Nondreamer should add up to 1.}
