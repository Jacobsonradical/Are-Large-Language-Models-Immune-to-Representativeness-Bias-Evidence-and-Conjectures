{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring.

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that both Brett and his father are "Nondreamers" is equal to the product of the individual probabilities (0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04), which is 0.04 or 4%.

However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer", given that Brett is a "Nondreamer". This is a conditional probability, and we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate it.

Let D be the event that a person is a "Dreamer" and N be the event that a person is a "Nondreamer". Then, we want to find P(N|N), the probability that a person is a "Nondreamer" given that their child is also a "Nondreamer".

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(N|N) = P(N) * P(N|D) / [P(N|D) * P(D) + P(N|N) * P(N)]

We know that P(N) = 0.2 and P(D) = 0.8. We also know that P(N|D) = 0.2 (the probability that a "Dreamer" has a "Nondreamer" child) and P(D|N) = 1 (since we are given that Brett is a "Nondreamer").

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(N|N) = (0.2 * 0.2) / [(0.2 * 0.8) + (1 * 0.2)]
= 0.04 / (0.16 + 0.2)
= 0.04 / 0.36
= 0.1111

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is approximately 0.1111 or 11.11%.
