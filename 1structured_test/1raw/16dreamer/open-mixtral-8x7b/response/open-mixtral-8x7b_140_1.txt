{probability: 0.25 or 0.2, depending on whether dreaming status is assumed to follow Mendelian genetics}

The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is reported to be independent in successive generations. If we assume that this trait follows Mendelian genetics, then it can be treated as a dominant/recessive trait with "Dreamer" being the dominant trait. In this case, a person who is a "Nondreamer" would have to have received the recessive trait from both parents. The probability of this occurring with two heterozygous parents (one "Dreamer" and one "Nondreamer") is 0.25 for each child. Therefore, the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is 0.25.

However, if we do not make any assumptions about the genetics of dreaming, we can only say that 20% of people are "Nondreamers," so the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.
