{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. In other words, Brett's father has a 20% (or 0.25) chance of being a Nondreamer, just like any person in the population.
