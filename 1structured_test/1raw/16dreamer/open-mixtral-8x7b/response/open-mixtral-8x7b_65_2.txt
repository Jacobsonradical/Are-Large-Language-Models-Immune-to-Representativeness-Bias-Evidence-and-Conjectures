{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20% or 0.2, but since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer "given" that Brett is a Nondreamer, we use the formula for conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), and the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is (0.2)^2 = 0.04, so the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer is 0.04 / 0.2 = 0.2 or 20%}
