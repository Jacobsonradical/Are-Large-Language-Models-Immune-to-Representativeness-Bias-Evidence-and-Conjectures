{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is still 20% (or 0.25 as a decimal), assuming that the prevalence of Nondreamers in the population remains the same. This is based on the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers and 80% are Dreamers.
