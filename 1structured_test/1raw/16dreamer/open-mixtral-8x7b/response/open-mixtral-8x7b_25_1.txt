{probability: 0.4, since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2. However, since the problem states that only 20% of people are Nondreamers, and assuming that this ratio is consistent across generations and populations, there is an 80% chance that a random person is a Dreamer and a 20% chance that they are a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04, or 4%.}
