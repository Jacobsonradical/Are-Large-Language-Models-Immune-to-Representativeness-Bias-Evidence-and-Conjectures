{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not give us any information about his father's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
