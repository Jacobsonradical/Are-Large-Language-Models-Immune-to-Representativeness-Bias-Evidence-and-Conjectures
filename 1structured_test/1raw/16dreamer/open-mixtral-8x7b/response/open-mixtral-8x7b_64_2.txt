{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett is a "Nondreamer" does not affect the probability that his father is also a "Nondreamer." Since the base rate of "Nondreamers" in the population is 20%, assuming similar distribution across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.25 (20% chance).
