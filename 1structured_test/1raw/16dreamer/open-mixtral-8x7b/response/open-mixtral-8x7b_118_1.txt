{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
