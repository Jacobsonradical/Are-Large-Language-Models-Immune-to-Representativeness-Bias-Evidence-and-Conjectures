{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since only 20% of people are "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, or 0.25.
