{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2) in the general population, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
