{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

In this case, Brett is a Nondreamer, but the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, assuming that the probability distribution is the same for all people regardless of their family history.
