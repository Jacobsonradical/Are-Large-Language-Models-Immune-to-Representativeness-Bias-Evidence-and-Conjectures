{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether or not Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, there is a 20% probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
