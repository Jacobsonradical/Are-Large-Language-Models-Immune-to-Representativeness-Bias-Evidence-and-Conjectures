{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, assuming that the dreaming status of Brett's father and Brett are independent events.
