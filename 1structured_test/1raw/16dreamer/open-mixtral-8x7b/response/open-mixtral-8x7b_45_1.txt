{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is also 0.2.
