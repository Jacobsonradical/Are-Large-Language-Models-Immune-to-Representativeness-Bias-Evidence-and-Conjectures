{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", if Brett is a Nondreamer, there is a 20% probability that his father is also a Nondreamer, assuming that the dreaming status of Brett's father and Brett are independent events.
