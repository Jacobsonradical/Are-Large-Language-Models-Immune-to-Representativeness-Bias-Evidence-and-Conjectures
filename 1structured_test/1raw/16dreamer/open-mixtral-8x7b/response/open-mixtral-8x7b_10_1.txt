{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2 for the general population, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 0.2, regardless of Brett's dreaming status.
