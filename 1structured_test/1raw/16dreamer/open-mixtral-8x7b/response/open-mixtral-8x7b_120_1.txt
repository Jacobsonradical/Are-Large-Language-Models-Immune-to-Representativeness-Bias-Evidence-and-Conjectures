{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that whether someone is a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" does not depend on their parents' dreaming status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the base rate of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
