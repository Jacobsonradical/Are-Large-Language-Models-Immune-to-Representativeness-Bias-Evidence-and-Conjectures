{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing Brett's dreaming status does not provide any information about his father's dreaming status. Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," we would assign a probability of 0.2 or 20% that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer."
