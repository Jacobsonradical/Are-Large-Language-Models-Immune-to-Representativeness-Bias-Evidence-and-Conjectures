{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that whether Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, assuming that the classification is determined randomly and the population distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is equal.

However, it is important to note that the actual probability might be different if there is a genetic or environmental factor that influences the classification. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact probability. But based on the given information, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.
