{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

Since the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is (0.2) * (0.2) = 0.04, or 4% if expressed as a percentage. However, since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to consider both possibilities for Brett - that he is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (Brett is a Dreamer and his father is a Nondreamer) + 0.2 (Brett is a Nondreamer and his father is a Nondreamer) = 0.4, or 40% if expressed as a percentage.
