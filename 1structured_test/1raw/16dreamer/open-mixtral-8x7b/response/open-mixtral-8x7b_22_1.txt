{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

In this case, Brett is a Nondreamer (20% probability). Since the dreaming status is independent in successive generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate: 20%, or 0.25 in decimal form.
