{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, so the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 20% or 0.2. However, the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, so we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability of a random person being a Nondreamer is 0.2, and the probability of being a Nondreamer, given that the person is a child of a Nondreamer, is also 0.2 (since the classification is independent in successive generations). Therefore, the probability of a Nondreamer father, given that the child is a Nondreamer, is (0.2)^2 / (0.2)^2 + (0.8)^2 = 0.04 / 0.64 = 0.0625 or 6.25%. However, since the question asks for the probability in the format of a number between 0 and 1, we need to divide it by 100, so the answer is 0.4 or 40%.}
