{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's dreaming status does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, there is a 20% (or 0.2) chance that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.
