{probability: 0.4, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, and 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, but since we are asked for the probability given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers, which is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04, or 4% as a percentage.}
