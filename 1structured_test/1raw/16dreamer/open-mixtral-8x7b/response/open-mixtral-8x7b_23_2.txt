{probability: 0.2 or 20%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that Brett being a "Nondreamer" does not affect the probability of his father being a "Nondreamer." Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," we can assume that Brett's father also has a 20% chance of being a "Nondreamer."
