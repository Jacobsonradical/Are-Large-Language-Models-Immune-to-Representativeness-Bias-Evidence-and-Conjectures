{probability: 0.25 or 25%}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since only 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is 0.2, or 25%.
