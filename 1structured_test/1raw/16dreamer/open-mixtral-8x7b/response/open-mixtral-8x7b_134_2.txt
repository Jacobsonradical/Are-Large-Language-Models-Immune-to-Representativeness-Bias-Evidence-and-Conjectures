{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 0.2 (or 20%). 

However, since the question asks for the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the conditional probability P(Father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer). 

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Father is a Nondreamer) = 0.2
P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Nondreamer) = 1 (since if the father is a Nondreamer, it is certain that he will pass this trait to his offspring with a probability of 1)
P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Nondreamer) \* P(Father is a Nondreamer) + P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Dreamer) \* P(Father is a Dreamer)

We know that P(Brett is a Nondreamer) = 0.2 (since Brett is a Nondreamer) and P(Father is a Nondreamer) = 0.2. Therefore, we can calculate P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Dreamer) as follows:

P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Dreamer) = (P(Brett is a Nondreamer) - P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Nondreamer) \* P(Father is a Nondreamer)) / P(Father is a Dreamer)
= (0.2 - 1 \* 0.2) / (1 - 0.2)
= 0

Therefore, the conditional probability P(Father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) is given by:

P(Father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(Brett is a Nondreamer | Father is a Nondreamer) \* P(Father is a Nondreamer) / P(Brett is a Nondreamer)
= 1 \* 0.2 / 0.2
= 1

However, since this probability is not between 0 and 1, we need to calculate the prior probability P(Father is a Nondreamer) instead, which is equal to 0.2, as explained earlier.
