{probability: 0.25}

The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that knowing that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer, which remains 20% or 0.25 (since 20% is the proportion of Nondreamers in the population).
