{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that having one nondreamer parent does not affect the chances of being a nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a nondreamer is the same as the base rate of nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
