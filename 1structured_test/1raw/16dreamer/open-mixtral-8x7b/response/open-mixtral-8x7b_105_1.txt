{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. Since only 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that both Brett and his father are Nondreamers is 0.20 x 0.20 = 0.04, or 4%. However, since we are only interested in the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we can simply use the base rate of 20%. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
