{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

We are given that Brett is a Nondreamer, which means he belongs to the 20% of people who do not report dreaming. Since dreaming status is independent in successive generations, the father of a Nondreamer has a 20% probability of also being a Nondreamer (the same probability as the general population), and an 80% probability of being a Dreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.25 or 25%.
