{probability: 0.25}

The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. This means that a person's dreaming status does not affect the dreaming status of their offspring. 

In this case, Brett is a Nondreamer. The probability of his father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the base rate of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (20%). Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
