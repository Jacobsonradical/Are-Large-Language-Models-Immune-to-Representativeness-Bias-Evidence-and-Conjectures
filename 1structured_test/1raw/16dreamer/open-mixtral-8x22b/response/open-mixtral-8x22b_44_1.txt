{probability: 0.2,
Based on the information given, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%. This probability remains constant regardless of Brett's classification as a Nondreamer.}
