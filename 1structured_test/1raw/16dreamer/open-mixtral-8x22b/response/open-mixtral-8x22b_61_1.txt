{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification is independent in successive generations and assuming that the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers is uniform across the population, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 (or 20%).
