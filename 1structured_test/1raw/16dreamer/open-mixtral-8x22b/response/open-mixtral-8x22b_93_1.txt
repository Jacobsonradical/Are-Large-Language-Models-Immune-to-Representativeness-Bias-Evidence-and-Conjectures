{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The question states that 20% of people are Nondreamers. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father also being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
