{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The information given states that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of a person being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not affected by their parents' classification. Since 20% of people are "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.2.
