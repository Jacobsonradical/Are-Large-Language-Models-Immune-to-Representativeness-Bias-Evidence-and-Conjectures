{probability: 0.2}

Since the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer is not affected by whether his father is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
