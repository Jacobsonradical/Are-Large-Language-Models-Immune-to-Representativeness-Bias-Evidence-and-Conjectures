Explanation:
The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer, as the classification is found to be independent in successive generations. Since the overall population of Nondreamers is 20%, or 0.2, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 0.2.}
