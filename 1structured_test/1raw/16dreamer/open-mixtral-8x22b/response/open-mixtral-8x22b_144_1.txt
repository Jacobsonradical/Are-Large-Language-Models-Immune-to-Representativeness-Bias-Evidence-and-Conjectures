{probability: 0.2}

The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, meaning that the dreaming behavior of parents doesn't influence the dreaming behavior of their children. Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
