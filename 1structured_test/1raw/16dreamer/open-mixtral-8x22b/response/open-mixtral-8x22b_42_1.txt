{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
If the classification is independent in successive generations, then Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
