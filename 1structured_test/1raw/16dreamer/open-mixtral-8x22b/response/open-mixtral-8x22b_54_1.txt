{probability: 0.2,
Explanation: The probability of someone being a Nondreamer is given as 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form. Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
