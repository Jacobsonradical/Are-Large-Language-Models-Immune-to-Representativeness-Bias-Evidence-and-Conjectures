{probability: 0.2,
The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, which means the dreaming behavior of a parent does not affect the dreaming behavior of their child. Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.}
