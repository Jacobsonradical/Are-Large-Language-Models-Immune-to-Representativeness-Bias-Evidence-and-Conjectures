To solve this problem, we need to know that the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent of successive generations. This means that the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

According to the information given, 20% of people are Nondreamers. This translates to a probability of 0.20 (since 20% = 0.20 when expressed as a decimal).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
