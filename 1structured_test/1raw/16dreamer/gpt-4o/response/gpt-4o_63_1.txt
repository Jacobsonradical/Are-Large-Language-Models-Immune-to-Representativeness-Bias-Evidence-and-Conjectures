To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we use the fact that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means the probability that someone is a Nondreamer is the same regardless of whether their child is a Nondreamer or Dreamer.

Given:
- Probability of being a Nondreamer (P(Nondreamer)) = 0.20
- Probability of being a Dreamer (P(Dreamer)) = 0.80

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer.

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
