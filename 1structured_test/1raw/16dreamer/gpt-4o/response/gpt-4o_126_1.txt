Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent across successive generations.

The probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Since the classification is independent across generations, knowing that Brett is a Nondreamer does not change the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person in the population is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
