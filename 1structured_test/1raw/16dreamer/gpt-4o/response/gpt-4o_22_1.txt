Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. According to the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Dreaming behavior (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent across generations, which implies that the classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer for an individual does not depend on their parent's classification.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
