Given that the classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent between generations, we can use the overall probability distribution for the population for this calculation.

From the information given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that anyone in the population is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
