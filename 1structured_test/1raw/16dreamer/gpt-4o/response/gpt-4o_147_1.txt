Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

According to the data, 20% of the population are Nondreamers. Since the classification with respect to dreaming is independent in successive generations, the status of Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population.

{probability: 0.20}
