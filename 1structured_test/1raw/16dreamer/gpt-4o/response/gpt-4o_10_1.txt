Let’s denote the following probabilities:
- \( P(D) \) is the probability that a person is a Dreamer, which is 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(ND) \) is the probability that a person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%, or 0.2.

Given that dreaming behavior is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the unconditional probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Hence, the probability that Brett’s father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
