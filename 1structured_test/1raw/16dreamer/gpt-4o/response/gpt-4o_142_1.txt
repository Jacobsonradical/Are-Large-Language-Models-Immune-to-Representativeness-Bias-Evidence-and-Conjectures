To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. Since dreaming classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- Probability of being a Nondreamer (P(N)) = 0.20

Therefore:

{probability: 0.20}
