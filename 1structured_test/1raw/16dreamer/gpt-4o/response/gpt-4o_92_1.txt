We are given that 20% of people are Nondreamers. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20, or 20%.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer, since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
