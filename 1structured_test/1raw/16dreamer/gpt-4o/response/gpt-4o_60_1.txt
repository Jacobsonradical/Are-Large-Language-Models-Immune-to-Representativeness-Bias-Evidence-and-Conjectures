To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we will look at the proportion of Nondreamers in the population and use this as an estimate.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, we assume that Brett's father's classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer follows the same proportions as the general population. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
