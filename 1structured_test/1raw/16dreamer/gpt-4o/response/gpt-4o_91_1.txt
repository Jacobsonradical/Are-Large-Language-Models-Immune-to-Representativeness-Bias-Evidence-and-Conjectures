Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer would be simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

From the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
