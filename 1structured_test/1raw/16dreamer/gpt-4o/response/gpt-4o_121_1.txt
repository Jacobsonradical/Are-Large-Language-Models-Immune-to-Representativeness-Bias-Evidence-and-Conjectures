Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general probability for any individual being a Nondreamer in the population.

Since 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
