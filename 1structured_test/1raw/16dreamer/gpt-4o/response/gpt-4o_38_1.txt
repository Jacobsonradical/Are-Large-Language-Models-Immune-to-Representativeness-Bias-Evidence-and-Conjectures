To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we use the information provided:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Given the independence between generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
