The problem states that 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" and 20% as "Nondreamers", and this classification is independent across successive generations. This implies that the probability of being a Nondreamer does not depend on whether a parent is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Given Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer remains 20%, as the classification is independent.

Therefore, the probabilities are:
{probability: 0.2}
