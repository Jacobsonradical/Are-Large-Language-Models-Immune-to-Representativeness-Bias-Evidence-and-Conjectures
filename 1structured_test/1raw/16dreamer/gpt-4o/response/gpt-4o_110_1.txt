Based on the information provided, dreaming is independent across generations. This means that the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
