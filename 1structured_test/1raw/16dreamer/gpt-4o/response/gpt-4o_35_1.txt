Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we seek the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. We know from the provided information that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, and this classification is independent across generations. 

The independence of the classification means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability in the population of any person being a Nondreamer. Hence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2 in decimal form.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
