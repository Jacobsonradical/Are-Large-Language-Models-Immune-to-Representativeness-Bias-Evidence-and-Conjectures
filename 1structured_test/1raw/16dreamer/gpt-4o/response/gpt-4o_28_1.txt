Given the information that Brett is a Nondreamer and knowing the general population distribution of Dreamers (80%) and Nondreamers (20%), the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any randomly chosen person being a Nondreamer in the general population. This is because the classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Therefore:

{probability: 0.2}
