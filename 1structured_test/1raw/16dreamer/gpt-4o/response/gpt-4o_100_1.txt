Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" should be the same as the general probability in the population. 

According to the information provided, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.20.
