Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
