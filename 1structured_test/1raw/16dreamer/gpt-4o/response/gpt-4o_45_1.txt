To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to rely on the fact that the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is independent across generations. Because of this independence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the population.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
