Given that being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
