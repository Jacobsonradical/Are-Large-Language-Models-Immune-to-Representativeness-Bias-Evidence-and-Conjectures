Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Let's denote this as \( P(\text{Nondreamer}) = 0.20 \).

Since the classification regarding dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population's probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
