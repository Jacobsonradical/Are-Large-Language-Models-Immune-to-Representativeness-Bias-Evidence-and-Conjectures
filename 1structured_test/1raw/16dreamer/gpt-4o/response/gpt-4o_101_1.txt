Given the information provided in the question:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers."
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification is found to be independent across generations.

Since the classification is independent, Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability for someone being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
