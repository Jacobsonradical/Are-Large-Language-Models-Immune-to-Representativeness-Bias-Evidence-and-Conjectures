We know from the problem statement that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and 80% are classified as "Dreamers". The classification is independent across generations, meaning the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
