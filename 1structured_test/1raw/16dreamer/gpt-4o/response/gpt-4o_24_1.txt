Given that the classifications of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" are independent in successive generations, the probability of someone being a Nondreamer is the same across all generations.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.2.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
