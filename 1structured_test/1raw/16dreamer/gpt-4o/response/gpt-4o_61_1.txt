To solve this, we can use the concept of conditional probability. From the information provided:

- 80% of people are Dreamers (D), so the probability \( P(D) \) is 0.80.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers (ND), so the probability \( P(ND) \) is 0.20.
  
Because the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
