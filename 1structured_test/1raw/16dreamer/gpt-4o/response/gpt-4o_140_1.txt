Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we aim to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. 

The classification of people into Dreamers and Nondreamers is given as:
- 80% are Dreamers.
- 20% are Nondreamers.

Since the classification with respect to dreaming is independent across generations, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability for any randomly selected person in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
