Given the information, the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father also being a Nondreamer.

According to the data provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall prevalence of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
