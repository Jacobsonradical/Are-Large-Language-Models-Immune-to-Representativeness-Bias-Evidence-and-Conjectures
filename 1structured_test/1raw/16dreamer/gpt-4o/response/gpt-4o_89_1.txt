Given that 80% of people report that they dream and 20% report that they do not remember ever dreaming, we can calculate the probabilities accordingly.

Let's denote:
- P(D) as the probability that a person is a Dreamer.
- P(N) as the probability that a person is a Nondreamer.
- P(N_f | N_s) as the probability that the father is a Nondreamer given that the son is a Nondreamer.

From the given information:
- P(D) = 0.8
- P(N) = 0.2

The classification with respect to dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations. Therefore, the father's status as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly selected person from the population is a Nondreamer.

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is \( P(N) = 0.2 \).

So the answer would be:

{probability: 0.2}
