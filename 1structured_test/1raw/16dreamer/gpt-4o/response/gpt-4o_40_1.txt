Given that 20% of people report not remembering ever dreaming, the probability of any given person being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

According to the information provided, the classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent across generations. This means that the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any man being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
