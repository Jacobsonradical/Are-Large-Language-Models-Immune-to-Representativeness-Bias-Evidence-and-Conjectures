Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we can interpret this percentage as the probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of dreamers and nondreamers is found to be independent across generations, Brett's father's probability of being a Nondreamer is the same as it is in the general population.
