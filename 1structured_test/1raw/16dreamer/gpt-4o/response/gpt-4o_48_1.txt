Given that dreaming status (Dreamer or Nondreamer) is independent between successive generations, we can infer the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer based on the general population statistics without considering Brett's status directly.

According to the problem, 20% of people are Nondreamers and 80% are Dreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
