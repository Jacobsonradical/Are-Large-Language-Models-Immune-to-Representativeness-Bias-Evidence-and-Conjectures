To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we utilize the fact that the classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent across generations. This implies that knowing Brett's classification provides no additional information about his father's classification.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as Dreamers.
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer (P(Father is Nondreamer)) is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
