Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
