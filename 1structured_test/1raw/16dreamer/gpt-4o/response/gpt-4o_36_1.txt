Given that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer should be the same as the overall probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer. Based on the given information, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.
