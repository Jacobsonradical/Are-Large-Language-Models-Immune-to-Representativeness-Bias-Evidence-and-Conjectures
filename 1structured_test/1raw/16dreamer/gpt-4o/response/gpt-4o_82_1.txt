Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. 

First, let's denote the following probabilities:
- \( P(N) \) as the probability that someone is a Nondreamer.
- \( P(D) \) as the probability that someone is a Dreamer.

From the information provided:
- \( P(N) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(D) = 0.80 \)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that someone is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
