Given that the classification with respect to dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the population that are classified as Nondreamers.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (which is 20%).

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
