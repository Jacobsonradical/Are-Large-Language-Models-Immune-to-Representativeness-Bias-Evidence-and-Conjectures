The information provided states that 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% are classified as Nondreamers. It also states that the classification is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability that someone is a Nondreamer does not depend on whether their parent is a Dreamer or Nondreamer.

Given Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
