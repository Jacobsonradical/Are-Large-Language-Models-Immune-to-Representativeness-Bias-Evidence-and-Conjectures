Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer, given that the trait of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent across generations. 

From the information given, we know that:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
