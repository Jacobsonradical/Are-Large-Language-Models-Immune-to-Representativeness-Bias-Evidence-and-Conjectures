Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.

Given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

This translates to a probability of 0.20.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
