Given the information, we know that the probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, Brett's father's probability of being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
