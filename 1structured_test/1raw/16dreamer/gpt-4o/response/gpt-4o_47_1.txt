To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the fact that the classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. Since the probability that any given individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, regardless of the status of their relatives, we can use this information directly.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
