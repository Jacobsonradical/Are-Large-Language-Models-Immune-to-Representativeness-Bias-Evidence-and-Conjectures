Given the information provided, the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. 

This means that the probability of being a "Nondreamer" for any individual is the same regardless of their parent's classification. It has been stated that 20% of people are "Nondreamers".

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 20% or 0.2.

Thus, the probability can be represented as follows:

{probability: 0.2}
