Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we are tasked with finding the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. The classification of dreaming is stated to be independent across generations, which means the likelihood of an individual being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is not influenced by their parent's classification.

According to the given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, meaning the probability of being a Dreamer (D) is \( P(D) = 0.8 \).
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, meaning the probability of being a Nondreamer (N) is \( P(N) = 0.2 \).

Since the probability of being a Nondreamer in successive generations is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as that for any randomly chosen individual.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
