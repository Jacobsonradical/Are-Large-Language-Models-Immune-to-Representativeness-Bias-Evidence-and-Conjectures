Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. 

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream (Dreamers), and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

This classification is independent across generations, which means the status of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer does not depend on whether a parent is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Thus, regardless of Brett being a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population's proportion of Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
