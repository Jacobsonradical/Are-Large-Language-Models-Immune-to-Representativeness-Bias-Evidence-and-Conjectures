If Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and this classification is independent across generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
