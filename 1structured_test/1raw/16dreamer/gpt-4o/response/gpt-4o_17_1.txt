Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, assuming that the classification is independent across generations, would simply be the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
