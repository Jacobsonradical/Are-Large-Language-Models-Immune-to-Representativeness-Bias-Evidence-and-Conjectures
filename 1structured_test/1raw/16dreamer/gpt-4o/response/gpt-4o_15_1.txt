Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. 

The classification of individuals into Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent from generation to generation. Given the initial information in the question, 80% of people are Dreamers and 20% are Nondreamers. This probability distribution applies to any individual, regardless of their parent.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
