To determine the probability that Brettâ€™s father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given data:

- 80% of people are Dreamers
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

The classification as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. 

Given this information, the probability that any given individual (including Brett's father) is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
