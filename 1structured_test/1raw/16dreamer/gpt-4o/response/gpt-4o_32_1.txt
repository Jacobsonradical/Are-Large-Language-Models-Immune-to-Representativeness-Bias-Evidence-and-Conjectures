To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information provided. Since the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent across generations, this means that Brett's father's probability of being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer.

According to the information given:
- 80% of people are reported to be Dreamers.
- 20% of people are reported to be Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

```{probability: 0.2}```
