Given the information that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, and assuming independence in the classification across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer would be equal to the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
