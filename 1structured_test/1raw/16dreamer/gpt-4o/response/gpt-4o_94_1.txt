Given the information that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, this implies that:

- The probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, P(N) = 0.20
- The probability that any given person is a Dreamer, P(D) = 0.80

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability for being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
