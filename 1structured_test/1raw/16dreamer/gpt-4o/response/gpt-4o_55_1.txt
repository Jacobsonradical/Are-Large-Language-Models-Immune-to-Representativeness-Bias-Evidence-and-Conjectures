Given the information that 20% of people do not remember ever dreaming, we can infer that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20. The problem also states that the classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. This means the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability found in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
