Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to know the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. The problem states that the classification as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. This implies that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is statistically independent of Brett's classification.

According to the data in the problem, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
