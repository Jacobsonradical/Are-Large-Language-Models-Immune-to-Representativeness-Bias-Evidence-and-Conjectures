Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, this percentage will apply to any randomly selected individual, including Brett's father. Since the classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer remains the same.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
