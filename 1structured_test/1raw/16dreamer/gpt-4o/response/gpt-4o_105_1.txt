To solve this problem, we utilize the information given about the overall population distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers. Specifically, we know:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person from the population is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.20}
