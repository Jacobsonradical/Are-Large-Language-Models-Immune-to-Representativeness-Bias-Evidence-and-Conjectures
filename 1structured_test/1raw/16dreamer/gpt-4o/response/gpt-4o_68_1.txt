Given the provided information that 80% of people are categorized as "Dreamers" and 20% are categorized as "Nondreamers," and the classification is independent across generations, we can determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general probability in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
