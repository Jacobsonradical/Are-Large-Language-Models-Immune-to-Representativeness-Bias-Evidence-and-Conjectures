Given that the classification of dreaming is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability for the population.

From the information provided, 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
