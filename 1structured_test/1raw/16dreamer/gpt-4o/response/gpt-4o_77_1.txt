To answer the question, we need to apply the given information about the probability of people being classified as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers". 

According to the information provided:
- 80% (or 0.8) of people are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% (or 0.2) of people are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.

Given:
- Probability that a person is a Nondreamer = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
