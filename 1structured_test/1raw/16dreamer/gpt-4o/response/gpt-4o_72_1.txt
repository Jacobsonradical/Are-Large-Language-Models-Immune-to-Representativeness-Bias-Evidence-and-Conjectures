To address the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we start by using the information that 20% of the general population are Nondreamers. Since dreaming status is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer should be the same as the probability for any randomly chosen person.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
