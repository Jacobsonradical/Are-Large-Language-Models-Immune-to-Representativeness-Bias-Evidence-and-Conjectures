Given that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

From the information provided, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
