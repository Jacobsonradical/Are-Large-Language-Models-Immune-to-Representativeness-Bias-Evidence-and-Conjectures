Given:

1. 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers".
2. 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
3. Dreaming classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

If Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the general population because the classification is independent in successive generations. 

Therefore, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
