To solve this problem, we'll use the information given in the problem statement. We know the following:

- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers."
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."

Given that the classification is independent across successive generations, the probability that any person is a Nondreamer is 0.20, irrespective of the status of their offspring.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
