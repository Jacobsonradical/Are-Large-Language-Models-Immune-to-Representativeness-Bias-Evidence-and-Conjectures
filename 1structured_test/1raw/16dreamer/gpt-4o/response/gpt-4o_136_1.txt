Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

Based on the information provided:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
