Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, and knowing that 20% of the population are Nondreamers, we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
