To find the probability that Brett’s father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers and that this classification is independent across generations.

Given:
- Probability that a person is a Nondreamer (P(N)) = 0.20
- Probability that a person is a Dreamer (P(D)) = 0.80

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the state of being a Nondreamer or Dreamer is independent of his father's classification, the probability that Brett’s father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
\[ \text{Probability} = P(N) = 0.20 \]

So, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.20} \} \]
