Given the information that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", let's represent this probability as \( P(N) = 0.20 \).

Since classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer does not depend on Brett's status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability for any given person in the population to be a Nondreamer.
