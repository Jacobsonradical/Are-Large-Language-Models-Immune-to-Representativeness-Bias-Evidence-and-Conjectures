Given the information that 20% of the population are classified as Nondreamers, we can assume that in any given generation, the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
