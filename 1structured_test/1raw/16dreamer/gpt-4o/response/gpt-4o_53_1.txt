Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", we can calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that Brettâ€™s father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
