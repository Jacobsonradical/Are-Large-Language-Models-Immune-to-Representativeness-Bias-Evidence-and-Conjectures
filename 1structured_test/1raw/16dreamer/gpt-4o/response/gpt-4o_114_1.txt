To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided to us. From the problem, we know that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers. Additionally, the classification is independent across successive generations.

Given Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer remains the base probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

So, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
