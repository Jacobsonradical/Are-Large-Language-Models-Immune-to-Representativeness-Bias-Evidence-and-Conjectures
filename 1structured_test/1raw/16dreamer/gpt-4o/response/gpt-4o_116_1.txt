Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is independent of Brett being a Nondreamer, as the classification is independent in successive generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
