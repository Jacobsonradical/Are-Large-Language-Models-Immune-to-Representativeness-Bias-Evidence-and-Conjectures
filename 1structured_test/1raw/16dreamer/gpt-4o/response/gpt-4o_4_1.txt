We are given that 20% of people report that they do not remember ever dreaming, and these are classified as "Nondreamers." 

Brett is a Nondreamer, so we need to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability in the general population.

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, which is 0.20 in decimal form.

So the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
