Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers and this classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be directly derived from the given population statistics.

Since the classification is independent across generations:

\[ P(\text{Father is a Nondreamer}) = \text{Proportion of Nondreamers in the population} = 0.20 \]

Therefore:

{\<probability\>: 0.20}
