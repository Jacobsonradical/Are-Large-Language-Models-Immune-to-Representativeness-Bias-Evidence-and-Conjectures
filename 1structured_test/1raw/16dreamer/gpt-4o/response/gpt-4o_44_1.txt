Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Given the independence of dreaming between successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer should be the same as the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer in the population.

From the information provided in the problem, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
