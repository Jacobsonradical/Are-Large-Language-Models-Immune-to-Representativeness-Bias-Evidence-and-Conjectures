Given that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of the population that is classified as Nondreamers.

Since 20% of people are Nondreamers:

\(\text{probability} = 0.20\)

Therefore, the probabilities that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
