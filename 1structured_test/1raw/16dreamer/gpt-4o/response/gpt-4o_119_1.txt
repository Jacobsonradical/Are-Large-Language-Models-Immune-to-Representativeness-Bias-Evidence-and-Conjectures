To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population. We know that 80% are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
