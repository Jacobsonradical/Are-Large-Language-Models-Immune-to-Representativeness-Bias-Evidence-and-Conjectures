To solve this, we need to understand the probability of a parent being a Nondreamer given that their child, Brett, is a Nondreamer. The information provided suggests that 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. 

Let's denote:
- D as the event that a person is a Dreamer.
- N as the event that a person is a Nondreamer.

Given:
- P(N) = 0.20 (the probability that a person is a Nondreamer)
- P(D) = 0.80 (the probability that a person is a Dreamer)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
