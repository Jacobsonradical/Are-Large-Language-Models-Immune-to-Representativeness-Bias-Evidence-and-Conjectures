Given the information provided, we know that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

Since the classification is stated to be independent across successive generations, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. The probability remains the same as that for any randomly selected person, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
