Based on the information provided, the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer does not depend on whether their parent is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of a person being a Nondreamer.

So, the probability is:

{probability: 0.2}
