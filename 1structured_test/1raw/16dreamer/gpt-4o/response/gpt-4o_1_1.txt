Given that the classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, we can calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer using the given data.

From the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability in the population.

{probability: 0.2}
