Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the classification of dreaming is stated to be independent across generations. This means that the probability of someone being a Nondreamer does not change based on whether their parent is a Nondreamer or a Dreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer in the population.
