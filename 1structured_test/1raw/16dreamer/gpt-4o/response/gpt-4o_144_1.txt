Given the information that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, we assume that this probability applies uniformly across generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, should be the same as the general probability for any individual to be a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
