Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent across successive generations, the probability of any person being a "Nondreamer" is not influenced by whether their parent is a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer."

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" remains 20%, regardless of Brett's classification.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
