Given that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the general probability in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
