Given the information, Brett is classified as a Nondreamer, which corresponds to 20% of the population. The classification of dreaming behavior is said to be independent across generations. Therefore, Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any given person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
