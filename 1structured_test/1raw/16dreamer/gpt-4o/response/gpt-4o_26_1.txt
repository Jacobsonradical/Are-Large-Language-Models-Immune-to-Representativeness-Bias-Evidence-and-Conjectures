Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we are trying to determine the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, the probability that any given person, including Brett's father, is a Nondreamer remains 20%, regardless of Brett's classification.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
