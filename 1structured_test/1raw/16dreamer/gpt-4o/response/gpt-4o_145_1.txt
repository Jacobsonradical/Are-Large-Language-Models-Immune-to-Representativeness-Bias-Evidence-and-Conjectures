To answer the probability question, you can use the information provided in the question. Since the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
