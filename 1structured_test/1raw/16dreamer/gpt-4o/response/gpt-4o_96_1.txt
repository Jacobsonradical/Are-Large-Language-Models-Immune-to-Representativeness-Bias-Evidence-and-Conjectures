To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to consider that the Nondreamer characteristic is independent across generations. This independence means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any individual being a Nondreamer in the population.

From the information given:
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
