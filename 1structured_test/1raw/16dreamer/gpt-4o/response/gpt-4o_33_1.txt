Given that Brett is a Nondreamer and that the classification of dreaming is independent across generations, we can calculate the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer using the information provided about the general population.

From the information:
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, i.e., they are Nondreamers.
- This translates to a probability of \(P(\text{Nondreamer}) = 0.20\).

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
