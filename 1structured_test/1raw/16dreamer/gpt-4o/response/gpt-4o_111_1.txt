To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the given probabilities about the general population.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D) \) as the probability that someone is a Dreamer.
- \( P(N) \) as the probability that someone is a Nondreamer.

We are given:
- \( P(D) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(N) = 0.20 \)

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly selected person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brettâ€™s father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
