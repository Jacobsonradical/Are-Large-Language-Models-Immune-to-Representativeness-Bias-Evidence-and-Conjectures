Given the information, we know that the classifications of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" are independent in successive generations.

The probability that a randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

Since these classifications are independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
