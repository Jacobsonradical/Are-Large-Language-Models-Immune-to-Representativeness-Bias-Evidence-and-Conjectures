To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that 20% of people are Nondreamers and dreaming classification is independent across generations.

This independence implies that the probability of Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of any person being a Nondreamer.

Given:
- Probability of any person being a Nondreamer = 20% or 0.20

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}
