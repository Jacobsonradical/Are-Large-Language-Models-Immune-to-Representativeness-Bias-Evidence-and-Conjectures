The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent across generations. Given the general population statistics where 20% of people are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the probability of any randomly selected person being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is {probability: 0.2}.
