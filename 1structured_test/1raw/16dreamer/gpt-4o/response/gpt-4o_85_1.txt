Given that 20% of people are Nondreamers, we need to calculate the probability Brett's father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, Brett’s classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett’s father is also a Nondreamer is simply 20%, or 0.2.
