To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we consider the given information that 20% of people, irrespective of sex, are Nondreamers. This percentage indicates the probability of any randomly chosen person being a Nondreamer.

Given that the classification with respect to dreaming is independent across successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
