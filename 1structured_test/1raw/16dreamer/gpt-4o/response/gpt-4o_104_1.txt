First, let's summarize the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent between generations.

Brett is a Nondreamer (20% of the population).

Since the classification is independent between successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of the population are Nondreamers:

{probability: 0.2}
