To solve the problem, we can use the provided information and basic probability principles. Let's define the terms:

- \( D \) represents Dreamers.
- \( N \) represents Nondreamers.

According to the given information:
- \( P(D) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(N) = 0.20 \)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer (given that Brett is a Nondreamer) remains unchanged. Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer.

Thus, the probability is:

{probability: 0.20}
