Given that 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that any given individual (such as Brett) is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer remains the same.

Thus, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
