{probability: 0.2}

Given that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any randomly chosen person from the population is a Nondreamer. According to the given data, 20% of people are Nondreamers. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
