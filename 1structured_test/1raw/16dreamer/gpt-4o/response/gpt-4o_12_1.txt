To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to consider the probabilities given:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Assuming that the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer. 

So, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.2}
