Given that we know Brett is a Nondreamer, we are asked to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Let's use the given information:

- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- 80% of people are Dreamers.

Since the classification is said to be independent between generations, the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is constant and does not change based on the status of their parent. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Hence, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.20}
