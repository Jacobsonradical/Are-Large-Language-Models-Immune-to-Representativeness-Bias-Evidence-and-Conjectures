Given the information, 80% of people are classified as Dreamers and 20% as Nondreamers. Since classification is independent across generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer. 

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.
