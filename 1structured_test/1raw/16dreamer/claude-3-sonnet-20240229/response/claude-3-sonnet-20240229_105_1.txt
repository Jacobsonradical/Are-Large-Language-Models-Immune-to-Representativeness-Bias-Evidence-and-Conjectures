To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independence between successive generations for the trait of being a "Nondreamer" or "Dreamer."

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers."
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the trait is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
