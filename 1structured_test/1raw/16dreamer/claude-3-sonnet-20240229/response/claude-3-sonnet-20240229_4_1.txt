{probability: 0.2}

To explain:

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (they report dreaming, even occasionally).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (they claim they never dream).
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

The classification of the son (Brett) being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of the father being a Nondreamer because the trait is independent across generations.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
