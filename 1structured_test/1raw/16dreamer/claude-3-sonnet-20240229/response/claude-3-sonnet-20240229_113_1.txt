To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
