{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" who do not remember dreaming.
- The question states that the classification is independent in successive generations.
- This means that Brett being a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.
- Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
