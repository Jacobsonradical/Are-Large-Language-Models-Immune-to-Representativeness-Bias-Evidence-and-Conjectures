{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
- It is also given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 or 20%, which is the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
