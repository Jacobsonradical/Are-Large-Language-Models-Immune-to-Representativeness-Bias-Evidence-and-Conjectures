{probability: 0.2}

To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to understand that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent across generations.

Since 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%), regardless of Brett's classification.

The independence of the trait across generations means that knowing Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information to help predict his father's status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer remains at the baseline probability of 0.2.
