{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they don't remember ever dreaming.
- It is also stated that the classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and this classification is independent across generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
