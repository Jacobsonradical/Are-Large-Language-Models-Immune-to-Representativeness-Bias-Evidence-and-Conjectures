{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the dream status of Brett's father is not affected by Brett's own dream status.
- We are given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Since the classification is independent between generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
