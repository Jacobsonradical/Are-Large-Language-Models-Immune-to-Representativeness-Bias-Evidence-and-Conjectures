To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population, and the fact that the classification is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream, even occasionally).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
