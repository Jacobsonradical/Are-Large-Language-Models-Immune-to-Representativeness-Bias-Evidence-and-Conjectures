{probability: 0.2}

Since the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any information about his father's status. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
