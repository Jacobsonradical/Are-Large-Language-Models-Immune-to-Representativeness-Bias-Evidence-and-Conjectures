{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The information also states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2 or 20%.
