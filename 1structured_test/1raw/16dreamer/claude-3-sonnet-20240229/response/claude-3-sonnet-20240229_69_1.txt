{probability: 0.2}

To explain, if dreaming is an independent trait between generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer does not depend on whether Brett himself is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer. Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of Brett's own dreaming status.
