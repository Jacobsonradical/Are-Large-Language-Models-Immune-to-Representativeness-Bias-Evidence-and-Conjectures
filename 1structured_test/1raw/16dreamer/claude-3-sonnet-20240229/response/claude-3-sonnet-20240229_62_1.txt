To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
