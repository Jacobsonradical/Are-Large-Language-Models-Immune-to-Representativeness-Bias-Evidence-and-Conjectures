To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

We know that:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
