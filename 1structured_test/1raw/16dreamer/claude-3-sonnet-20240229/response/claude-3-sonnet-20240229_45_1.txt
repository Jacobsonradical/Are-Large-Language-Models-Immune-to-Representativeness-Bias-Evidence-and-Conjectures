{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also states that this classification is independent in successive generations.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of a person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
