{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", which means they do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
