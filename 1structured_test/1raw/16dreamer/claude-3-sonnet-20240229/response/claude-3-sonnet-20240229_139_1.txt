To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (dream occasionally or regularly).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer."

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the general probability of being a "Nondreamer," which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
