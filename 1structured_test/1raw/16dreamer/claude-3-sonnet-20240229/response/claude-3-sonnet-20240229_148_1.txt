To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independence between generations and the given information that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers."

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
