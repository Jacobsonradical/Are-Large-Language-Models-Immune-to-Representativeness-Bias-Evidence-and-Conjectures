{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- Given that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers" according to the information provided.
- Since it is mentioned that the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer does not depend on whether Brett himself is a Nondreamer or not.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
