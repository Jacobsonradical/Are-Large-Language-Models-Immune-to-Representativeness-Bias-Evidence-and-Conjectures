To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independence between successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (P(Dreamer) = 0.8).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (P(Nondreamer) = 0.2).
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
