{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the information provided, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also stated that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and this classification is independent of his father's classification, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2 or 20%.
