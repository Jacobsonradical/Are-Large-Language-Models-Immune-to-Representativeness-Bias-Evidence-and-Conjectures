{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%), as the classification is independent across generations. The father's status as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's status, so the probability remains the same as the general population prevalence of 20% for Nondreamers.
