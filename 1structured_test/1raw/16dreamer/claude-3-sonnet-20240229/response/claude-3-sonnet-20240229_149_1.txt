{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
- The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer, since the characteristic is independent across generations.
