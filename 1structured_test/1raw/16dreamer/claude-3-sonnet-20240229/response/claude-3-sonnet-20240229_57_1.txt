To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

According to the problem statement:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they do not remember dreaming).
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
