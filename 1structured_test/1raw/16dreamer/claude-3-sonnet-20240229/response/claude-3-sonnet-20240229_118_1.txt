To solve this problem, we need to use the given information that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent of his father's status, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer remains the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
