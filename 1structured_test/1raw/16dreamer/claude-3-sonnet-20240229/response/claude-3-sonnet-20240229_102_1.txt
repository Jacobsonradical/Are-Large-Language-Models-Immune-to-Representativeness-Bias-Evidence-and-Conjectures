To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability of his father being a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status. It is simply the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
