To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the concept of independent events.

Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
