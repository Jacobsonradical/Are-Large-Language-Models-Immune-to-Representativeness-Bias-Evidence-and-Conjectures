To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
