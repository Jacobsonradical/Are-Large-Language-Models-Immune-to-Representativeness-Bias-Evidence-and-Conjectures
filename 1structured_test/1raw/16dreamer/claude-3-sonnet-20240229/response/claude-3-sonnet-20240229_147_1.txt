{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It is also stated that the classification of dreaming or non-dreaming is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and this trait is independent across generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
