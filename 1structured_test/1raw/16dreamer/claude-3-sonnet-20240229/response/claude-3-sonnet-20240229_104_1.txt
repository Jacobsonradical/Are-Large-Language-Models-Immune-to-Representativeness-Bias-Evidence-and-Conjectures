To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
