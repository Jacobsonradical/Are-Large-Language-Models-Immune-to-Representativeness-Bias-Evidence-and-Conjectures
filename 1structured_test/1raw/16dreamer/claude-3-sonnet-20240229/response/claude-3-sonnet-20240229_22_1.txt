{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", i.e. they claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
