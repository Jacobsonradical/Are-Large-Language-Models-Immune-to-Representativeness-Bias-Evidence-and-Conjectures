{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The statement says that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", which means they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- The classification is stated to be independent in successive generations, meaning that knowing Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability for his father. So the probability that his father is a Nondreamer remains at the base rate of 0.2.
