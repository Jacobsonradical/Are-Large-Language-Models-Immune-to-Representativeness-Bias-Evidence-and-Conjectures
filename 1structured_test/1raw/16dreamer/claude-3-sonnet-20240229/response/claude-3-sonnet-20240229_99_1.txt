{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., they claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It also states that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), which is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population.
- The independence between generations means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer, so it remains at the baseline probability of 0.2.
