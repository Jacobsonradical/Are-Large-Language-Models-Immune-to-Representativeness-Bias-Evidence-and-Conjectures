To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (dream, if only occasionally).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
