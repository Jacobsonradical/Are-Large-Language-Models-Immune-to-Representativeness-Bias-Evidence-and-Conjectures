To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability theory.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer.

The probability that a randomly selected individual is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
