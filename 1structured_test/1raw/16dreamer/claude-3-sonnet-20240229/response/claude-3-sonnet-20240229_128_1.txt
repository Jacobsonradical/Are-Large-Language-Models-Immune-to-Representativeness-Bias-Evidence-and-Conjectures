To solve this problem, we need to use the given information that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
