To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (dream occasionally or regularly).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (claim they never dream).
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
