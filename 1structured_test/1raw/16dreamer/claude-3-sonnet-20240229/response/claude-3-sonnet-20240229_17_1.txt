To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information given about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
