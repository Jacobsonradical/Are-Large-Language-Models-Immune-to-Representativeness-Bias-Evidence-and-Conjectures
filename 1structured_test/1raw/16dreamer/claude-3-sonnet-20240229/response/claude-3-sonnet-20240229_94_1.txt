{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (those who claim they do not remember ever dreaming).
- It also states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

The independence of the trait across generations means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. The probability remains at the baseline value of 0.2 for the general population.
