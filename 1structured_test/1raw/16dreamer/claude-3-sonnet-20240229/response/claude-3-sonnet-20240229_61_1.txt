To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%), regardless of Brett's own classification.

{probability: 0.2}
