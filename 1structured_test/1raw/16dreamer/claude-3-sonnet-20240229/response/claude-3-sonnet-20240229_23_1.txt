{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and this classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 or 20%.

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer because the trait is independent across generations. Therefore, the probability remains the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
