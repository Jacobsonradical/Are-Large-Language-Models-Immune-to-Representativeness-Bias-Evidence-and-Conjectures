{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
Given that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and this classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply 0.2 or 20%.

The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about his father's dreaming status since the trait is independent across generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer remains at the baseline probability of 0.2 or 20%.
