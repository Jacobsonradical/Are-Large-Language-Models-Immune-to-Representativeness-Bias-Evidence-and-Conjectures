To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of independence between successive generations, which means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer or a Dreamer is not affected by the status of their parents.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
