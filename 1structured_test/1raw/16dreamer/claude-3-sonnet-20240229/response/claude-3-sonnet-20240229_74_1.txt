{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", which means they do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also states that the dreaming classification is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent across generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
