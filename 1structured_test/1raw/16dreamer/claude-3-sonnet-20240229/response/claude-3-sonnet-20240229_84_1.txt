{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.
- The classification is stated to be independent in successive generations, meaning that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability for his father.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
