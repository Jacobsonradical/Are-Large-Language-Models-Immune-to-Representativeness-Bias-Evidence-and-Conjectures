To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independence between generations.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
