To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers," and 20% are "Nondreamers."
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
