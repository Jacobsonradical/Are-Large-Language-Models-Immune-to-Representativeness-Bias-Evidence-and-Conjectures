To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

According to the problem statement:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream)
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they do not remember ever dreaming)
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent across generations

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is:

{probability: 0.2}
