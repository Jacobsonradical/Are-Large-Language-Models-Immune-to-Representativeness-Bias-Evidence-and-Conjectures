{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" who do not remember ever dreaming.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- The fact that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
