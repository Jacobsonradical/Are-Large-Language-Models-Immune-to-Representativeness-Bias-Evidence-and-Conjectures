To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote the event that Brett's father is a Nondreamer as F, and the event that Brett is a Nondreamer as B.

We want to find P(F|B), the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(F|B) = (P(B|F) × P(F)) / P(B)

P(B|F) is the probability that Brett is a Nondreamer, given that his father is a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, this probability is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

P(F) is the prior probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, which is also 0.2 (given information).

P(B) is the overall probability that Brett is a Nondreamer, which is also 0.2 (given information).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(F|B) = (0.2 × 0.2) / 0.2 = 0.2

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
