To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream, at least occasionally).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they do not remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, and the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.2}
