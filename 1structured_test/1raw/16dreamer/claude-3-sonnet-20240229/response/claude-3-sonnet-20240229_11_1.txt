To calculate the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and the laws of probability.

Given:
- 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
