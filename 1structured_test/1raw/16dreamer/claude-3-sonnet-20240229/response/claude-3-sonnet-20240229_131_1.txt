To answer this question, we need to use the given information and the concept of independent events in probability theory.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of an individual as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent of their parents' classification.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
