To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
