To solve this problem, we need to use the given information that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
