To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" (i.e., they dream).
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers" (i.e., they don't remember ever dreaming).
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
