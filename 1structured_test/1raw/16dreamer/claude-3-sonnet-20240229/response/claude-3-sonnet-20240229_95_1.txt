{probability: 0.2}

To explain:

The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and that this classification is independent across generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

The fact that dreaming classification is independent across generations means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer. The probability remains at the overall population probability of 0.2.
