To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is given as 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
