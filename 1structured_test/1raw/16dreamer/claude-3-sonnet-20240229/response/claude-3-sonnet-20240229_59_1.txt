To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers" (i.e., 0.8 probability of being a Dreamer).
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" (i.e., 0.2 probability of being a Nondreamer).
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
