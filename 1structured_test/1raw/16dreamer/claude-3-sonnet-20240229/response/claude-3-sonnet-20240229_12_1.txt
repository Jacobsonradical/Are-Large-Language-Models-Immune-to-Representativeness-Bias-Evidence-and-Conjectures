To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events in probability theory.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
