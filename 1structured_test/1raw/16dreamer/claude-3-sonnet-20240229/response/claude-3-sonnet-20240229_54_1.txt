{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- The question states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" who claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- It also mentions that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2 or 20%.
