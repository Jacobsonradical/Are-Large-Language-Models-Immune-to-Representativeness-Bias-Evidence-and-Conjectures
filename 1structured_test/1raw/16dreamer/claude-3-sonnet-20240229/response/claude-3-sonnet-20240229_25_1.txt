To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer.

Given information:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers," and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers."
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
