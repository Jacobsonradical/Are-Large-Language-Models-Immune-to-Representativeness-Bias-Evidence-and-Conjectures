{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the given information, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers" and 80% as "Dreamers".
- The statement also mentions that the classification is independent in successive generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, is 0.2.
