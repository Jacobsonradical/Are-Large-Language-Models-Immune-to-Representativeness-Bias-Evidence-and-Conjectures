To find the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer, given that Brett himself is a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided in the problem statement.

The problem states that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is not affected by Brett's own classification as a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer, which is given as 0.2 or 20%.
