{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the information given, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is independent in successive generations, meaning that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
