To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information that the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
