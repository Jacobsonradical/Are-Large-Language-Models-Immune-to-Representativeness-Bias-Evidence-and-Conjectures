{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
- According to the information given, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers", meaning they do not remember dreaming.
- It is also stated that this classification is independent across generations.
- Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
- The independence across generations means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer does not influence the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.
