To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of independent events in probability theory. Since the question states that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, it means that the probability of a person being a "Nondreamer" is not affected by whether their parent is a "Nondreamer" or not.

Given information:
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is simply the probability that any randomly selected person is a "Nondreamer", which is 0.2 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.2}
