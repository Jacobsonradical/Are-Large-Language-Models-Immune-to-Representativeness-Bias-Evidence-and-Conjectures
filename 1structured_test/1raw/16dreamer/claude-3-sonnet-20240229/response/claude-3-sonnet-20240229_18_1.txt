{probability: 0.2}

To explain:
Given that the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is stated as 20% or 0.2.

Brett's classification as a Nondreamer does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer since the traits are independent across generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer remains at the overall population probability of 0.2.
