To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20, and the classification is independent across generations.
