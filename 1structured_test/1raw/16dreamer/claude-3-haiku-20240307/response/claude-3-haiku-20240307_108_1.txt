To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The probability that an individual is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random individual is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
