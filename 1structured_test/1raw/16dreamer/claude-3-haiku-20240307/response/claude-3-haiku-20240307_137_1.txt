To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, either occasionally or regularly.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

This is because the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of being a Nondreamer does not depend on the status of the previous generation.
