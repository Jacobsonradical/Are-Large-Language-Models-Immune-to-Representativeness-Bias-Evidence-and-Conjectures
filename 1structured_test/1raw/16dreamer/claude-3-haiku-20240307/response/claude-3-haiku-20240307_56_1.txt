To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%) regardless of their parents' classification.
