To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his father is also a "Nondreamer" is the probability of two independent "Nondreamer" events occurring.

The probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is 20%, which is the same as the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population. This is because the classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
