To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the fact that this classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
