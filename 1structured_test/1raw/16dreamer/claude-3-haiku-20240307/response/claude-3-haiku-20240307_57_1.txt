To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20% of the population).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
