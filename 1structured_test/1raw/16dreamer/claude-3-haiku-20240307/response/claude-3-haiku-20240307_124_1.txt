To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 0.20 (20%), and this probability remains the same across generations due to the independence of the classification.
