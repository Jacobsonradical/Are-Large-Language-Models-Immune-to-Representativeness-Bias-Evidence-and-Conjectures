To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his father is also a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The probability that someone is a "Nondreamer" is 0.20 (20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.20.
