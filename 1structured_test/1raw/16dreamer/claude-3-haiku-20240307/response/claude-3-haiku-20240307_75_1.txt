To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the fact that the classification is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
