To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the probability of people being "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%) because the classification is independent in successive generations. If 20% of people are Nondreamers, then the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
