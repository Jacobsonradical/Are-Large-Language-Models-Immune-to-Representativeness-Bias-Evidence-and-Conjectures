To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
