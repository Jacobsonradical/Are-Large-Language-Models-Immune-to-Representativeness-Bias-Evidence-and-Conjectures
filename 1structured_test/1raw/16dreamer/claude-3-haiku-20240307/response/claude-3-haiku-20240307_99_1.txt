To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers
- 20% of people are Nondreamers

Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
