To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is not affected by the status of their parents.
- Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
