To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20% of the population).
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, as the classification is independent.
