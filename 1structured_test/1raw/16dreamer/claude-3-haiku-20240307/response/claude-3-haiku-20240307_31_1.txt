To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of the father being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
