To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of this classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the percentage of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
