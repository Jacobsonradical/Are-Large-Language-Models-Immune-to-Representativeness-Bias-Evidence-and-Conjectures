To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of this classification in successive generations.

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
