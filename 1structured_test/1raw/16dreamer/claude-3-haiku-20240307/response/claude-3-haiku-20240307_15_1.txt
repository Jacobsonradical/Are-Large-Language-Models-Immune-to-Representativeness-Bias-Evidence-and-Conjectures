To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote the event that Brett is a Nondreamer as "Brett is a Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer, is the conditional probability P(Brett's father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer).

Using the given information, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Brett's father is a Nondreamer | Brett is a Nondreamer) = P(Brett's father is a Nondreamer) = 0.20

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
