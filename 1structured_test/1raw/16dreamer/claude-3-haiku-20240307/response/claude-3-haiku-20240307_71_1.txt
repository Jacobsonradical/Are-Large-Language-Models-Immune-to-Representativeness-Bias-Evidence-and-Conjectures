To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- If the classification is independent in successive generations, then the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.20.
