To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20% (0.2) regardless of their parents' classification.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
