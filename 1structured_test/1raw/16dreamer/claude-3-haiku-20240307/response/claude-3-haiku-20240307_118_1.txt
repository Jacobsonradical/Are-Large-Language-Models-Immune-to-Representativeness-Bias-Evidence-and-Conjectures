To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
