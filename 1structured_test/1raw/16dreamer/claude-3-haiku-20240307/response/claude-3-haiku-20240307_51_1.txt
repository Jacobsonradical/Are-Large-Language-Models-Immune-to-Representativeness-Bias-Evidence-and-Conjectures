To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability of being a "Nondreamer" in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
