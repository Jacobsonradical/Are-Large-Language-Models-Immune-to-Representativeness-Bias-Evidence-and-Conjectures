To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, and the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%.
