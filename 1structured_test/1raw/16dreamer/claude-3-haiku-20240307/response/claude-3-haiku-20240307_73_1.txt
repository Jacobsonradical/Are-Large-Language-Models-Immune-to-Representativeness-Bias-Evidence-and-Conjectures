To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, and this probability is independent across generations.
