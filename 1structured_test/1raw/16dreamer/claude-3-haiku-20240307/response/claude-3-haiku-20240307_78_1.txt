To answer this question, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

According to the problem statement, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers". This means that the probability of someone being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father also being a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
