To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
