To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
