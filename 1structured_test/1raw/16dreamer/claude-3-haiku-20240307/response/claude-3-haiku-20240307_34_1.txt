To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the proportion of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the conditional probability of a father being a Nondreamer given that his child is a Nondreamer.

Using the principle of independence in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
