To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 20% of people are Nondreamers, which means that 80% are Dreamers.

Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
