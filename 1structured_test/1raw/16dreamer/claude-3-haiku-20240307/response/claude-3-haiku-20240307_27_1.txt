To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the population distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim that they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.

This is because the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, meaning that the status of one generation does not depend on the status of the previous generation.
