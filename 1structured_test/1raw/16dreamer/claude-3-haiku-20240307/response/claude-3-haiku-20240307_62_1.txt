Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%, as the classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent across generations.
