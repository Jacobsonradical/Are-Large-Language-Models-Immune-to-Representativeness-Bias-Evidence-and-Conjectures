To answer this question, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
