To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information given in the problem.

According to the problem, 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers". This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since the classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
