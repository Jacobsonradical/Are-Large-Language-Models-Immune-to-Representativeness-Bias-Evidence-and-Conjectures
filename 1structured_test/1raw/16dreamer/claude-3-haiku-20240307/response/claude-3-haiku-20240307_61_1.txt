To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the independence of this classification in successive generations.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
