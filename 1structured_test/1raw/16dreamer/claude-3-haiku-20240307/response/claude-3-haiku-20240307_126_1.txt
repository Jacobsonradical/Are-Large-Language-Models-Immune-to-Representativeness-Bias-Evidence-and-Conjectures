To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the classification of people as "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" and the fact that this classification is independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and they are classified as "Dreamers".
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is not affected by the status of their parents.
- Since 20% of people are classified as Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
