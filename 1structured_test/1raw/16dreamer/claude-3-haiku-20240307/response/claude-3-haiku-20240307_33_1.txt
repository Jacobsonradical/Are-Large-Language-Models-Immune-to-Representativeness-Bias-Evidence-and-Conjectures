To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, we want to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 0.2 (or 20%).
