To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of a Nondreamer having a Nondreamer parent is 0.20 (or 20%).
