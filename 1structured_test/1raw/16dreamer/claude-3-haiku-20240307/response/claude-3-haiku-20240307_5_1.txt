To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information and the concept of independence.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any random person is a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
