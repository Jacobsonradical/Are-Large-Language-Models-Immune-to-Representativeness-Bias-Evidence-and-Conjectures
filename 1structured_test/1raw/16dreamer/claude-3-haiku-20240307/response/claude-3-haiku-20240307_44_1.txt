To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about the probability of his father being a Nondreamer.
