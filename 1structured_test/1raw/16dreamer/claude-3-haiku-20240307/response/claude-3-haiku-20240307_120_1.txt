To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a "Nondreamer", the probability that his father is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a "Nondreamer" is 0.2 (20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the probability that any random person is a "Nondreamer", which is 0.2.
