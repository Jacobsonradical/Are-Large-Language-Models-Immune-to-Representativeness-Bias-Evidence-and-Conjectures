To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20% in the population.
