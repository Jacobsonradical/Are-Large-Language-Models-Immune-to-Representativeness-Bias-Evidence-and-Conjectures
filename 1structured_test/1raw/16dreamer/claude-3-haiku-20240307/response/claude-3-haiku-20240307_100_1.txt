To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent probabilities.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that an individual is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (or 20%), as stated in the problem.
Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.
