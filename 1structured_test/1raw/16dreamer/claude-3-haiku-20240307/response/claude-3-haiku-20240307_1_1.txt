To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the probabilities of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.20).
