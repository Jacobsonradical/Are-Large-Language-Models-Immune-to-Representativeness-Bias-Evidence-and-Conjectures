To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the provided information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
