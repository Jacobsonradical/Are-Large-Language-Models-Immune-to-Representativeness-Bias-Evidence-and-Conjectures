To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
