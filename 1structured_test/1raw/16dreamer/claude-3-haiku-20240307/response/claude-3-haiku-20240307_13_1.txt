To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that any person is a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer does not provide any additional information about his father's status.
