To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the dreaming classification being independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
