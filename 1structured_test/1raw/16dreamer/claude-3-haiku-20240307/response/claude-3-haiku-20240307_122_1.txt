To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the concept of independence.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
