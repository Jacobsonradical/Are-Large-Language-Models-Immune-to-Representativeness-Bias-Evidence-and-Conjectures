To solve this problem, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The question states that 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
