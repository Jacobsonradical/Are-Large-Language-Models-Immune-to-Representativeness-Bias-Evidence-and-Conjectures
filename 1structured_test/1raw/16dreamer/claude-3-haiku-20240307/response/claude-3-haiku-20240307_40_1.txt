To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers."

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
