To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people into "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, even if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
