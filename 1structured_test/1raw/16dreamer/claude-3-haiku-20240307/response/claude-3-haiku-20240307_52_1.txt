To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
