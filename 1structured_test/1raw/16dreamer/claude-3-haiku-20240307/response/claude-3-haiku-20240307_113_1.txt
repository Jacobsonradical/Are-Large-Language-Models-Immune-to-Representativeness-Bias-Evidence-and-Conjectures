To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer = {probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, and the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
