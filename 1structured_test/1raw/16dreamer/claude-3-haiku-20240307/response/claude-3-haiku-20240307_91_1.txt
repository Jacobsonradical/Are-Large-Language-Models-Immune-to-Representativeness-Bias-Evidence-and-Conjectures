To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

We want to find the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer".

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the overall probability of being a "Nondreamer", which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2}
