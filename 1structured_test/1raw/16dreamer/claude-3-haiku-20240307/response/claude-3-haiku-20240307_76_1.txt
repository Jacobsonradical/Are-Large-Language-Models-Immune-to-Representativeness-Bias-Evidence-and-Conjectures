To solve this problem, we can use the information provided about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that the father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
