To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
