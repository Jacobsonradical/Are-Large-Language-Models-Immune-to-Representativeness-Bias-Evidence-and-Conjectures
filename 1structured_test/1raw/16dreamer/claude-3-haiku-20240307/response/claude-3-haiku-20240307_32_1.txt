To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20.
