To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the probability of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer, and the independence of the classification in successive generations.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, which is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
