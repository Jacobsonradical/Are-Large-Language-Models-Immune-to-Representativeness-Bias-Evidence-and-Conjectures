Given the information provided:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is that since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
