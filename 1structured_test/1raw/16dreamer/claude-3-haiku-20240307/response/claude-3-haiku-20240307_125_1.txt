To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided, 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
