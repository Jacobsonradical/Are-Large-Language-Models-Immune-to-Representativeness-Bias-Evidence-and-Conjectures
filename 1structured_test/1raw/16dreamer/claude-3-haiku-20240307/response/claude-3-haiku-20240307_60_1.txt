To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reason for this answer is that the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of their parents' classification.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, or 20%.
