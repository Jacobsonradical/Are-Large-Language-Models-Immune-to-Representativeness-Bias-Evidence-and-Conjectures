To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independent probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
