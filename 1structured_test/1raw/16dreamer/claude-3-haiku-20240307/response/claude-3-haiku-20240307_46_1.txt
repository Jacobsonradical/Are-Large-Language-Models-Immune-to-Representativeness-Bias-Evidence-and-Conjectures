To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification as Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

The reasoning is that the classification as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
