Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because, since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
