To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given information:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability that the father is a Nondreamer, given that the son is a Nondreamer, is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2 or 20%.
