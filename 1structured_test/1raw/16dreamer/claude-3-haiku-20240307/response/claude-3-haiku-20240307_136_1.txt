To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of this classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a "Nondreamer".

The probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.2.
