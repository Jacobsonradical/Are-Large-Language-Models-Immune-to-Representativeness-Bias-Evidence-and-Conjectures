To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information that the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
