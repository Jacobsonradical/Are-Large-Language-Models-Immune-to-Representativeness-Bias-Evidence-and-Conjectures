To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer having a Nondreamer child, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
