To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is not affected by the status of their parents.
