To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"

Since the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
