To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportion of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
