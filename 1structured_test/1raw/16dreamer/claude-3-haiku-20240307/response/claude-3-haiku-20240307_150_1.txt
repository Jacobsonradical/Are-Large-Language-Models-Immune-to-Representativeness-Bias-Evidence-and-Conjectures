To solve this problem, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.20.
