Given the information provided:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers"
- The classification of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.
