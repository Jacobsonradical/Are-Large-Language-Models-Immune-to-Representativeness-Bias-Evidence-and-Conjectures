To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

We want to find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
