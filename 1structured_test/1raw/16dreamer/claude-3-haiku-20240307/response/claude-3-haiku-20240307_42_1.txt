To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers occurring in successive generations, which is the product of their individual probabilities.

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20% of the population) since the classification is independent in successive generations.
