To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification as a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of a Nondreamer having a Nondreamer child, which is the probability of a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.2}
