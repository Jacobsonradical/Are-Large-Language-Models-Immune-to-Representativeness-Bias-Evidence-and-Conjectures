To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
