The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the given information.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, and this probability is independent across generations.
