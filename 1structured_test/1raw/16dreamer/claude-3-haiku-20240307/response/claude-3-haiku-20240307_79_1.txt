To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is independent of Brett's status as a Nondreamer. Since 20% of the population are Nondreamers, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
