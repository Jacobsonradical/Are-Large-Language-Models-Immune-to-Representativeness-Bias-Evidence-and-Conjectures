To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" and the independence of this classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is equal to the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.

This is because the classification as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations, meaning that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is not affected by whether their parents are Nondreamers or Dreamers.
