To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
