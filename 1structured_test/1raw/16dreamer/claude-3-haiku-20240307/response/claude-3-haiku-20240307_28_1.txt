To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the probability of two Nondreamers being in the same family, which is the probability of two independent events occurring.

The probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%).

The probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is:
{probability: 0.20}

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
