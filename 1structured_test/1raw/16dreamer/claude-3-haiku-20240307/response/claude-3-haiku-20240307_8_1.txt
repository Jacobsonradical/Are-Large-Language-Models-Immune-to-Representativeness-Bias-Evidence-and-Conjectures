To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification as a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, and the probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
