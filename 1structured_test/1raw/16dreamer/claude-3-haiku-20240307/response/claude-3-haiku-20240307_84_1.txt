To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of independence in the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" across successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

The rationale is as follows:
- If the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the general population, which is 20% or 0.20.
