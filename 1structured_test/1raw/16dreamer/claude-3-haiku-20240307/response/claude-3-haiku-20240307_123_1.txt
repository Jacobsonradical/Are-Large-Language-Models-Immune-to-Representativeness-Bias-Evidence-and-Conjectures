To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: your answer, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
