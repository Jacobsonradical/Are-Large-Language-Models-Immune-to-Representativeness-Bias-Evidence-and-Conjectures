To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the problem statement, 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
