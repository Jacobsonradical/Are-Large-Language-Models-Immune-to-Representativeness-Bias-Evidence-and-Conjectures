To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The information provided suggests that the classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent across generations. This means that the probability of a parent being a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
