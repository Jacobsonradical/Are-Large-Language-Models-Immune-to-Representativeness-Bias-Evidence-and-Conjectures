To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

According to the information provided, 80% of people report that they dream, either occasionally or regularly, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of people as Dreamers or Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
