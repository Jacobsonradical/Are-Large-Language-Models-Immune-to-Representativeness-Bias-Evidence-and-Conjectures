To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers"
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%, as the classification of being a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
