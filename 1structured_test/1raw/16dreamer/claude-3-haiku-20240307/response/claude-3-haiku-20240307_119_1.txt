To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, either occasionally or regularly.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".

Since the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations, we can use the probability of being a Nondreamer to calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer.

{probability: 0.20}

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20, or 20%, as this is the proportion of people in the population who are classified as Nondreamers.
