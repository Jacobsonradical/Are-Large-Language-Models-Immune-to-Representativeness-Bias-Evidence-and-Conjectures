To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of a person being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is not affected by the status of their parents.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
