To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification is independent in successive generations, which means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, regardless of their parents' classification.
