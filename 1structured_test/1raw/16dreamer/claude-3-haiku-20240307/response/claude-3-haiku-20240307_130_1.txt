To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independent probabilities.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
