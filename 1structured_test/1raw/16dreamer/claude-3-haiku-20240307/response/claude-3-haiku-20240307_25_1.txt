Given the information provided, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

According to the study, 20% of people are Nondreamers, which means that 80% are Dreamers.

Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

{probability: 0.20}
