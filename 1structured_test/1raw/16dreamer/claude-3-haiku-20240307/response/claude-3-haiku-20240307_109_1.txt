To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or Nonreamer is independent in successive generations.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nonreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nonreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nonreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.
