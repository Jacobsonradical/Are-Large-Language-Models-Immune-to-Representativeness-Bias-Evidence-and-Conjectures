To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent events.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of a person as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
Since the classification of a person as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
