To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independent probabilities.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification as "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2, as this probability is not affected by Brett's status as a Nondreamer.
