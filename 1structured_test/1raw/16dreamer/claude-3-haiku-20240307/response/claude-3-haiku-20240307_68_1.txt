To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the given information, 20% of people are Nondreamers. This means that the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
