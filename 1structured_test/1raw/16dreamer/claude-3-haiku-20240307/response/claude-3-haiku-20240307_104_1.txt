To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and the independence of the dreaming classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The classification of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
