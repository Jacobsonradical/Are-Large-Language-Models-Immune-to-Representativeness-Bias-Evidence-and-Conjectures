To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the problem statement, 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
