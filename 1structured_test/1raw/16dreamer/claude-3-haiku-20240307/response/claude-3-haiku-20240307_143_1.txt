To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

According to the information, 20% of people are Nondreamers, and this classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the classification of being a Nondreamer is independent in successive generations, and the proportion of Nondreamers in the population is 20%.
