To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the probabilities of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer".

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the principle of independence.

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer = {probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (20%) because the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is the same for each generation, regardless of the status of the previous generation.
