To solve this problem, we can use the concept of independence in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
