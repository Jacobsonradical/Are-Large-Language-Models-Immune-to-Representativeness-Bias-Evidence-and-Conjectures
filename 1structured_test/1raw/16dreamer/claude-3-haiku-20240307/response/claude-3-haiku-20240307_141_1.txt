To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, we can assume that the probability of an individual being a Nondreamer is also 20%.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}
