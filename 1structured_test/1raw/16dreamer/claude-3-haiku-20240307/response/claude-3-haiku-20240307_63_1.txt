To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and the assumption of independence between successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification as Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated using the concept of conditional probability.

The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the probability that a randomly selected person is a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Assuming independence between successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
