To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of independence in probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are classified as "Dreamers", and 20% are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same, which is 0.2.
