To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming.
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.
- Brett is a Nondreamer.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
According to the given information, the classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%) regardless of the status of their parents.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
