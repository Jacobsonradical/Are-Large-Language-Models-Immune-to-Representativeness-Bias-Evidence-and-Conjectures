To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". Since the classification of dreaming is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a "Nondreamer" is the same as the proportion of "Nondreamers" in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is:

{probability: 0.20}
