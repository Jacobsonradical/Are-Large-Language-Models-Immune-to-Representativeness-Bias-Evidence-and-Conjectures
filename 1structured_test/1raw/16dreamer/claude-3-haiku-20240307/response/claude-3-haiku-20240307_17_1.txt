To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

The information states that 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers. This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
