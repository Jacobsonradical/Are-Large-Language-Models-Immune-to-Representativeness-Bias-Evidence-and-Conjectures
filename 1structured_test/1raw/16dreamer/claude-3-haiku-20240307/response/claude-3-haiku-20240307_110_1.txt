To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

According to the information provided, 80% of people of both sexes report that they dream, while 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming. This means that the probability of being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.
