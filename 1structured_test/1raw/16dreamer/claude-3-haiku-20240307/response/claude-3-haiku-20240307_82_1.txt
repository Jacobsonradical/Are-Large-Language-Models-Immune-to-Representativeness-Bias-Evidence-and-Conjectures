To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of dreamers and nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of individuals as Dreamers or Nondreamers is independent across successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
