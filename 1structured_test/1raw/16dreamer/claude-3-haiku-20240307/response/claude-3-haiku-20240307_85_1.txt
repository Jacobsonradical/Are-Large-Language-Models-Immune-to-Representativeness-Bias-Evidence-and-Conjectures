To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers".

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, and 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The classification of people as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2, regardless of their parents' classification.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.
