To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, while 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

This is because the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 20%, and this probability is independent across generations.
