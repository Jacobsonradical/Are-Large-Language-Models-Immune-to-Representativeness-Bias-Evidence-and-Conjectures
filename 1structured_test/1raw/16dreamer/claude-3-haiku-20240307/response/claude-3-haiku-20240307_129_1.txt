To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

According to the information provided, 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers. This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Since the classification of a person as a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 or 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
