To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the proportions of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of individuals as "Dreamers" or "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
