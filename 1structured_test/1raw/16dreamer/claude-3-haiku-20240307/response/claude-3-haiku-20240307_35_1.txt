To find the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the proportion of Nondreamers in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
