To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers", and 20% are "Nondreamers".
- The classification of a person as a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

Explanation:
The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2, as the classification is independent in successive generations, and 20% of the population are Nondreamers.
