To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the proportion of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The classification of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" is independent in successive generations.
- This means that the probability of a person being a Nondreamer is 0.2 (20%), regardless of the status of their parents.
- Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
