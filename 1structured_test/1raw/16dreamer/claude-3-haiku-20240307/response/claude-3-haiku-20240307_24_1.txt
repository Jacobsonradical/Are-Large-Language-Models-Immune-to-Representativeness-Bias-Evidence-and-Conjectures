To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

The problem states that 80% of people are "Dreamers" and 20% are "Nondreamers". Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}
