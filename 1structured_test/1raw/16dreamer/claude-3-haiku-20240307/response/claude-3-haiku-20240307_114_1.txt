To solve this problem, we need to use the information given about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

Given information:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming, and they are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification of "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
- The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the probability of a random person being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.
