To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% or 0.2.
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability of the father being a Nondreamer is also 0.2 or 20%.
