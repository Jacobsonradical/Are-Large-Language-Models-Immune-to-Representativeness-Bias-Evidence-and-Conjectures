To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and the independence of the classification in successive generations.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming and are classified as "Nondreamers".
- The classification is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is that since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20% or 0.2.
