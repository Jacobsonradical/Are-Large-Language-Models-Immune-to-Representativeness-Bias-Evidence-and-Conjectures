To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the population distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers.

Given:
- 80% of people report that they dream, if only occasionally.
- 20% claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.2}

The reasoning is as follows:
- Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the population proportion of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
