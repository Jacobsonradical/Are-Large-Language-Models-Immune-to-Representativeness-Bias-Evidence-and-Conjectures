To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the proportions of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations.

Since Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2 or 20%.

{probability: 0.2}
