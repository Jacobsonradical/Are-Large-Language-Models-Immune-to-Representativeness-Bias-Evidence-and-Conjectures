To solve this problem, we can use the concept of conditional probability.

Given information:
- 80% of people are Dreamers, and 20% are Nondreamers.
- The classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is found to be independent in successive generations.

The probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer can be calculated as follows:

{probability: 0.20}

Explanation:
Since the classification of Dreamers and Nondreamers is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.
