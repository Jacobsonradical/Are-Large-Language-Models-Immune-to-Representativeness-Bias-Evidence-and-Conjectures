To calculate the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to use the given information about the distribution of "Dreamers" and "Nondreamers" in the population.

According to the information provided:
- 80% of people are "Dreamers"
- 20% of people are "Nondreamers"

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer is:

{probability: 0.2}

This is because the classification of being a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is found to be independent in successive generations. Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is the same as the overall probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 0.2 or 20%.
