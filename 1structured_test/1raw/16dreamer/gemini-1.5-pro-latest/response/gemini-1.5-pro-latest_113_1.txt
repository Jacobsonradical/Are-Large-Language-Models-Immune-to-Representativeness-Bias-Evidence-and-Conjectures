{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dream classification is independent across generations.  This means whether Brett is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no impact on the dream classification of his father. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the population prevalence of Nondreamers, which is 20% or 0.2.
