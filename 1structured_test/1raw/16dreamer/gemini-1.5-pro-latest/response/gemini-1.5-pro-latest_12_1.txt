{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status has no influence on Brett's dreaming status, and vice versa.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, regardless of Brett's own classification.
