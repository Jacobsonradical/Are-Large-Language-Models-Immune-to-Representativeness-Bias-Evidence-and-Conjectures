{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's own classification. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is also **20% or 0.2**.
