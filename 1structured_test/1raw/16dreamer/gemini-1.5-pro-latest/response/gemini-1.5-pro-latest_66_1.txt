{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's dreaming status is not influenced by whether his father dreams or not. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also **20% or 0.2**, regardless of Brett's own classification.
