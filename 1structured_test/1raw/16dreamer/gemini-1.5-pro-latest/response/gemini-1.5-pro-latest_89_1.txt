{probability: 0.2} 

Since dreaming classification is independent across generations, Brett's father's dream classification doesn't depend on Brett's classification.  The fact that Brett is a Nondreamer is irrelevant information. We are told that 20% of people are Nondreamers. 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the percentage of Nondreamers in the population.
