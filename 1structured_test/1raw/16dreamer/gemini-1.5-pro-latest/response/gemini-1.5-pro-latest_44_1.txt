{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations.  This means that whether Brett's father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is not influenced by the fact that Brett is a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population proportion: 20%, or 0.2.
