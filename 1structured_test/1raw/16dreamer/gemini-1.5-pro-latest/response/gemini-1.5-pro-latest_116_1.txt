{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means whether Brett's father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer doesn't depend on Brett's own classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the population frequency of Nondreamers.
