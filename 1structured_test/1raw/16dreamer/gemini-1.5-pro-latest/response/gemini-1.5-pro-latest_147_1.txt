{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The prompt states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming classification has no impact on Brett's classification, and vice-versa. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population frequency of "Nondreamers", which is 20% or 0.2.
