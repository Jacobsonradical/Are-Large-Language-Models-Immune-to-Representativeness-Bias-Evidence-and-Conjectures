{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's status as a Nondreamer has no impact on whether his father is or is not a Nondreamer. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the population proportion of Nondreamers.
