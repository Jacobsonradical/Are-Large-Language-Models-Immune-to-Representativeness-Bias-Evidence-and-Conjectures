**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status has no bearing on Brett's dreaming status.  Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", there's a 20% chance Brett's father falls into that category, regardless of Brett's own classification.
