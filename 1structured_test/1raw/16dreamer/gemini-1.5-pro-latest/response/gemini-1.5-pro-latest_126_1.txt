{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status has no bearing on Brett's dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population percentage, regardless of Brett's status.
