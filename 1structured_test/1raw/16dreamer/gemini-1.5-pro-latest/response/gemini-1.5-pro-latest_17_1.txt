The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's likelihood of being a dreamer or non-dreamer is not influenced by Brett's own dreaming status. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population frequency: 20%, or 0.2.
