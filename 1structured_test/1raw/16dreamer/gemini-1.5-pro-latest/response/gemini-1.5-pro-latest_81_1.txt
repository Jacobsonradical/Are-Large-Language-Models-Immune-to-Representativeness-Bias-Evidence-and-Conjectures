{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status has no bearing on Brett's dreaming status, and vice-versa.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population frequency of "Nondreamers," which is 0.2.
