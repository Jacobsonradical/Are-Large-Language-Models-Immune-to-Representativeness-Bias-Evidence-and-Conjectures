{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's own classification. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," there's a 20% chance that Brett's father falls into that category.
