{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

Since dreaming classification is independent across generations, Brett's father's dream classification doesn't depend on Brett's classification.  The problem states that 20% of people are classified as "Nondreamers." 

Therefore, the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the overall probability of any individual being a "Nondreamer," which is 20% or 0.2.
