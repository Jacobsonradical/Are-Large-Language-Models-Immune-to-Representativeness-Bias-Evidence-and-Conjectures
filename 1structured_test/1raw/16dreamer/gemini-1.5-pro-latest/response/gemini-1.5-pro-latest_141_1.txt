{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming classification has no impact on Brett's classification, and vice versa.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same as the population average.
