{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dream classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dream classification has no influence on Brett's classification, and vice versa.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the same as the population prevalence, which is **20% or 0.2**.
