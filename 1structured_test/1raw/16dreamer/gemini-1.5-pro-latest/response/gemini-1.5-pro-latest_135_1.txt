{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status is not influenced by Brett being a Nondreamer.

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the population prevalence of Nondreamers, which is 0.2.
