{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming classification has no impact on Brett's classification, and vice versa. 

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is also 20%, or 0.2.
