{probability: 0.2}

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means Brett's likelihood of being a Nondreamer is not influenced by whether his father is a Dreamer or a Nondreamer.  

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
