{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means Brett's father's dream classification doesn't depend on Brett's classification.  

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is simply **20% or 0.2**.
