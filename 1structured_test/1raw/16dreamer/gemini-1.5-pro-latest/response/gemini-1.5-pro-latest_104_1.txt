{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dream classification has no bearing on Brett's classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population percentage, regardless of Brett's own classification.
