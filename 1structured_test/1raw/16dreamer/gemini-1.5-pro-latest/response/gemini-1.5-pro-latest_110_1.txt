{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status has no impact on Brett's dreaming status, and vice versa. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population frequency, regardless of Brett's own classification.
