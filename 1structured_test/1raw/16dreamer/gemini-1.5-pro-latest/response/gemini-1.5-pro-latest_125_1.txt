{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent in successive generations.  This means whether Brett's father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer has no bearing on Brett's classification.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is simply the same as the general population frequency.
