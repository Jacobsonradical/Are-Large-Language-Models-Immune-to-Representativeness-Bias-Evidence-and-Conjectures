{probability: 0.2} 

Here's why:

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means whether Brett's father is a "Dreamer" or a "Nondreamer" is not influenced by the fact that Brett is a "Nondreamer".

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the population frequency of "Nondreamers", which is 0.2.
