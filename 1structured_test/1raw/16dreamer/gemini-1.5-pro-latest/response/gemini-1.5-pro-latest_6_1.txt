{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's dreaming status doesn't depend on Brett's status.  

Since 20% of the general population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability of Brett's father being a "Nondreamer" is simply the same: 20%.
