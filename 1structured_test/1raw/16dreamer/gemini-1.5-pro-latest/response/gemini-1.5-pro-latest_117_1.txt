{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means that Brett's father's likelihood of being a dreamer or non-dreamer is not influenced by Brett's own classification.

Since the overall probability of being a "Nondreamer" is 20%, the probability of Brett's father also being a "Nondreamer" is simply **20% or 0.2**.
