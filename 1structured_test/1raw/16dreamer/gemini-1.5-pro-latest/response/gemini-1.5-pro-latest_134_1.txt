{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is independent across generations. This means Brett's father's likelihood of being a "Dreamer" or "Nondreamer" is not influenced by Brett's own classification. 

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers", the probability that Brett's father is a "Nondreamer" is simply:

* **20% or 0.2**
