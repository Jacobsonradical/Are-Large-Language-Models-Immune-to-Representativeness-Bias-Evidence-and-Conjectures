{probability: 0.2} 

**Explanation:**

The problem states that dreaming classification is "independent in successive generations." This means whether Brett's father is a Dreamer or Nondreamer is unrelated to Brett's own classification.

Since 20% of the population are classified as "Nondreamers," the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the population proportion of Nondreamers.
