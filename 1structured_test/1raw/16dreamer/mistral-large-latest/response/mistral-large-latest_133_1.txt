To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and apply the concept of conditional probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D) = 0.8 \) (probability of being a Dreamer)
- \( P(ND) = 0.2 \) (probability of being a Nondreamer)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ P(\text{Father is Nondreamer}) = P(ND) = 0.2 \]

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.2
}
