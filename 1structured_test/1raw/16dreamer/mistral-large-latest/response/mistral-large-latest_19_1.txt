To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- The probability of being a Dreamer is 80% (or 0.8).
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20% (or 0.2).
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
