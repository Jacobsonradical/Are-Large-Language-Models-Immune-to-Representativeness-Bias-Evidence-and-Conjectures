To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information given about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

To express this as a probability between 0 and 1:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{20}{100} = 0.2 \]

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.2.
