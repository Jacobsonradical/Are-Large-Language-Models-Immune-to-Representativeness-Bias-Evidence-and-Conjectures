To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, given that Brett is a Nondreamer and that the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, we can use the following reasoning:

1. The probability that a person is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
2. Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is also 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

  "probability": 0.20
