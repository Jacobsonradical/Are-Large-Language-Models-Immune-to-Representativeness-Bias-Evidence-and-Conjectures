To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer in the requested format is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.20
}
```
