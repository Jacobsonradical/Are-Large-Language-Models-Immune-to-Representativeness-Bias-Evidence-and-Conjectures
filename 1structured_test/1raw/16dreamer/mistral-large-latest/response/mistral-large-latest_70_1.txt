To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the dictionary format answer is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.20
}
```
