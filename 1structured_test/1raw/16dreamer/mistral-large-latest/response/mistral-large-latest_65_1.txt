To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
