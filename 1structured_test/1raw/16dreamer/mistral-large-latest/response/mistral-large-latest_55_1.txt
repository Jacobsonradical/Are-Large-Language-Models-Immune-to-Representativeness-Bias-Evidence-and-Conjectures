To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information that the classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of Brett's father being a Nondreamer is the same as the general population probability of being a Nondreamer.

Given that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.

Therefore, the answer in the specified dictionary format is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.20
}
