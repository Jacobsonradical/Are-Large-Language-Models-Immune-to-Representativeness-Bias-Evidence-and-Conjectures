To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D) \) = Probability of being a Dreamer = 0.8
- \( P(ND) \) = Probability of being a Nondreamer = 0.2

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
\[ P(\text{Father is Nondreamer}) = P(ND) = 0.2 \]

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:
```json
{
  "probability": 0.2
}
