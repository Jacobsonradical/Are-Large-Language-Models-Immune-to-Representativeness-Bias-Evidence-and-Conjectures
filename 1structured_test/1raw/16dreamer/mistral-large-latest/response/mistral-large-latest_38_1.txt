To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. 20% of people are Nondreamers.
2. The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).

{probability: 0.20}
