To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

{probability: 0.20}
