To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the independence of the classification of dreaming across generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the base probability of being a Nondreamer in the population, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer in the specified dictionary format is:

```python
{probability: 0.20}
```
