To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information given about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of being a Nondreamer in the population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
