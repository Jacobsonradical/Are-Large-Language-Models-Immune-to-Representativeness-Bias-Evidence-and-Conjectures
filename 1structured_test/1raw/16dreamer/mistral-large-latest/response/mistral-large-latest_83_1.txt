To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given and the independence of the classification across generations.

1. **Given Information:**
   - 80% of people are Dreamers.
   - 20% of people are Nondreamers.
   - The classification is independent in successive generations.

2. **Brett is a Nondreamer:**
   - This information does not affect the probability of his father being a Nondreamer because the classification is independent across generations.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the base rate of Nondreamers in the population.
   - Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
