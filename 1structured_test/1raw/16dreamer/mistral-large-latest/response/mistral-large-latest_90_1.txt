To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
