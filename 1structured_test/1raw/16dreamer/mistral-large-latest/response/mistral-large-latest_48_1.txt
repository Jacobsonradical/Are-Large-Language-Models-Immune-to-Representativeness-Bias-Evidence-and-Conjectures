To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any randomly chosen person is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.

{probability: 0.2}
