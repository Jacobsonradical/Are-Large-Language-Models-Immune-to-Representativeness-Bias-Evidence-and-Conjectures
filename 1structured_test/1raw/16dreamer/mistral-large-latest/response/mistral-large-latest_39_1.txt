To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. 80% of people are Dreamers.
2. 20% of people are Nondreamers.
3. The classification is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the conditional probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Let's denote:
- \( P(D) \) = Probability of being a Dreamer = 0.8
- \( P(ND) \) = Probability of being a Nondreamer = 0.2

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ P(\text{Father is Nondreamer}) = P(ND) = 0.2 \]

So, the answer in the specified dictionary format is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.2
}
