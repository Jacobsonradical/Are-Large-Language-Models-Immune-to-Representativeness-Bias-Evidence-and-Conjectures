To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and apply some basic principles of probability.

1. **Given Information:**
   - 80% of people are Dreamers.
   - 20% of people are Nondreamers.
   - The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

2. **Independence Assumption:**
   Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is not influenced by Brett's classification.

3. **Calculation:**
   The probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
