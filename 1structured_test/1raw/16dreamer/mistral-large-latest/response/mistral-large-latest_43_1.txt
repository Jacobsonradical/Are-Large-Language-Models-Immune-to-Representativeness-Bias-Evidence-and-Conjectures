To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information that the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations. This means that the probability of being a Dreamer or a Nondreamer is the same for each generation.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20.
