To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
