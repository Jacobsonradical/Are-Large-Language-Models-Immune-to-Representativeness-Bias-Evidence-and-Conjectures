To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Let's denote:
- \( P(N) \) as the probability of being a Nondreamer.
- \( P(D) \) as the probability of being a Dreamer.

From the information given:
- \( P(N) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(D) = 0.8 \)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\text{{probability: 0.2}}
\]
