To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information that the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations and that 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming.

Given:
- Probability of being a Nondreamer = 20% = 0.20
- Probability of being a Dreamer = 80% = 0.80

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ \text{Probability} = 0.20 \]

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:

```json
{
  "probability": 0.20
}
