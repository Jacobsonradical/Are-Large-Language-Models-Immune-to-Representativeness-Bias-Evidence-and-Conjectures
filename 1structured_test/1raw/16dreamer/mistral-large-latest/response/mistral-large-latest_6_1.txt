To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. 80% of people are Dreamers.
2. 20% of people are Nondreamers.
3. The classification of Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the conditional probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Nondreamer}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{Dreamer}) = 0.8 \)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\boxed{0.2}
\]
