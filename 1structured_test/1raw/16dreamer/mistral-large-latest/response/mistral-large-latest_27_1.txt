To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. 80% of people are Dreamers.
2. 20% of people are Nondreamers.
3. The classification is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the conditional probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Let's denote:
- \( P(N) \) as the probability of being a Nondreamer (20% or 0.2).
- \( P(D) \) as the probability of being a Dreamer (80% or 0.8).

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any person being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[ P(\text{Father is Nondreamer}) = P(N) = 0.2 \]

So, the answer in the requested dictionary format is:

{
  "probability": 0.2
