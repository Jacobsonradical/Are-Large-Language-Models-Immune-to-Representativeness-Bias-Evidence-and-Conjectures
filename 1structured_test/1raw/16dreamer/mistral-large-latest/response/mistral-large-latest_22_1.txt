To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

- 20% of people claim they do not remember ever dreaming (Nondreamers).
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Given that the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.20 (or 20%).
