To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the information provided about the distribution of Dreamers and Nondreamers in the population.

Given:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
- The probability of being a Dreamer is 80%, or 0.80.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
