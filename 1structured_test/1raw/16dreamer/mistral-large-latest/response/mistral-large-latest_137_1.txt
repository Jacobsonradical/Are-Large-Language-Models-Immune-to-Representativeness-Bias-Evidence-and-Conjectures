To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information and apply the principles of probability.

Given:
- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Let's denote:
- \( P(\text{Dreamer}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{Nondreamer}) = 0.2 \)

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of any individual being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.2.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\boxed{0.2}
\]
