To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the given information:

- 80% of people are Dreamers.
- 20% of people are Nondreamers.
- The classification of being a Dreamer or Nondreamer is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer.

Since the classification is independent in successive generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the general probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20%.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
