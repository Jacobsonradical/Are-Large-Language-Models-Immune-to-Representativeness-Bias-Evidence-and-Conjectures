To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the general probabilities given in the problem statement. Since the classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations, the probability that any individual is a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer remains 20%, because the classification is independent.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is:
