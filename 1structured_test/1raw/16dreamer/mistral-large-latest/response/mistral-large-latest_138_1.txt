To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. 80% of people are Dreamers.
2. 20% of people are Nondreamers.
3. The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to calculate the probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent, the probability that his father is a Nondreamer is simply the overall probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 20% or 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:
