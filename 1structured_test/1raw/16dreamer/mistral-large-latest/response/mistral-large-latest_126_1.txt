To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we need to consider the information given:

1. The probability of being a Dreamer is 80%, or 0.8.
2. The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.2.
3. The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Given that Brett is a Nondreamer, we need to find the conditional probability that his father is also a Nondreamer. Since the classification is independent, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer in the general population.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is 0.2.
