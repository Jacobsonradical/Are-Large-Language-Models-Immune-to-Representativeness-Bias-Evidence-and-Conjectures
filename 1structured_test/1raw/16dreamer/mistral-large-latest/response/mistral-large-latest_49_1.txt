To determine the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the given information about the independence of dreaming classification across generations.

Given:
- The probability of being a Nondreamer is 20%, or 0.20.
- The probability of being a Dreamer is 80%, or 0.80.
- The classification of dreaming is independent in successive generations.

Let \( P(N) \) be the probability of being a Nondreamer, and \( P(D) \) be the probability of being a Dreamer.

Since the classification is independent across generations, the probability that Brett's father is a Nondreamer is simply the probability of being a Nondreamer, which is 0.20.

Therefore, the probability that Brett's father is also a Nondreamer is:

\[
\boxed{0.20}
\]
