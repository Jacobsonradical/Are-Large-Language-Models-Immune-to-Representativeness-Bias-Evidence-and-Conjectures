{probability: 0.7619047619047619}

To calculate the probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1,B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B1,B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * (1 - P(A)))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population information)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy for identifying tall people)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness's accuracy for identifying short people)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate for identifying short people)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness's error rate for identifying tall people)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B1,B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.7619047619047619

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.7619047619047619 or approximately 76.19%.
