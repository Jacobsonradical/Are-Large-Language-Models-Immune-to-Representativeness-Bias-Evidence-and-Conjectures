To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C)]

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
