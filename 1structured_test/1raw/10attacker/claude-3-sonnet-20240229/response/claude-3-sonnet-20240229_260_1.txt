To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the prior probability based on the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (Prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population distribution)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
