To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements.

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B2|A') = 0.3 (The second witness identifies the incorrect height 30% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.0756 / (0.0756 + 0.0510)
            = 0.597 or approximately 0.60

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.60}
