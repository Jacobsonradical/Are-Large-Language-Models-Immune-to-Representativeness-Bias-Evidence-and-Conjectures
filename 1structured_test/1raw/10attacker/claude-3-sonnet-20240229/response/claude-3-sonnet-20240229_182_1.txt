{probability: 0.4375}

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

From the given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights >= 185 cm 80% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights < 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights >= 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights < 185 cm 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
P(A|B,C) = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
P(A|B,C) = 0.036 / 0.155
P(A|B,C) = 0.4375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is 0.4375 or approximately 43.75%.
