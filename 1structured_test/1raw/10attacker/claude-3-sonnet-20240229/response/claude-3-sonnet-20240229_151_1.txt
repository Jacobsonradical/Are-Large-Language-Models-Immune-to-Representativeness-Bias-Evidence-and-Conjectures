To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) × P(B2|A) × P(A)) / (P(B1|A) × P(B2|A) × P(A) + P(B1|¬A) × P(B2|¬A) × P(¬A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
