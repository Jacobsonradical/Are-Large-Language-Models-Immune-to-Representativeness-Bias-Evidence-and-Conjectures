To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
