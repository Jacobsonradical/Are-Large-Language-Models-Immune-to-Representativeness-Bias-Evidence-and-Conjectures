{probability: 0.7692307692307693}

To calculate the probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B is the evidence, which consists of the witness statements

We have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 (the probability of getting the observed witness statements if the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (the probability of getting the observed witness statements if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85
     = 0.084 + 0.051
     = 0.135

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.135
       = 0.7692307692307693

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.7692307692307693.
