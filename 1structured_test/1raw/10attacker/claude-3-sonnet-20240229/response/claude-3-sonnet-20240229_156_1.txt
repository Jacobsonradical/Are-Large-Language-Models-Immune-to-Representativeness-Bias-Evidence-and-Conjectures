To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- Prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from "b")
- Probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from "a")
- Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (from "a")

Let's denote the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the event "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller" as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases: when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.414}
