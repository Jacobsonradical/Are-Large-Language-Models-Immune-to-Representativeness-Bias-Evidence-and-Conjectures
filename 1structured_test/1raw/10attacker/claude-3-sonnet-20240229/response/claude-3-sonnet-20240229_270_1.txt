To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in "a").
- The probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are is 0.8 (given in "b").
- The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter is 0.2 (1 - 0.8, given in "b").

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are, which is 0.8.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.29

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.414}
