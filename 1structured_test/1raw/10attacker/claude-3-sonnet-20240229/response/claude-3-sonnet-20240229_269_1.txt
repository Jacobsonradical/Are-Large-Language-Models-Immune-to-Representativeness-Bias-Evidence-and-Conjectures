To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 20% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.119)
            ≈ 0.168

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.168}
