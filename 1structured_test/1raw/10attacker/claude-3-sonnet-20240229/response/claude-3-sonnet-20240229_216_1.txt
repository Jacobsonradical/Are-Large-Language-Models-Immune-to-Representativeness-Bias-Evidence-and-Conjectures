To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.232}
