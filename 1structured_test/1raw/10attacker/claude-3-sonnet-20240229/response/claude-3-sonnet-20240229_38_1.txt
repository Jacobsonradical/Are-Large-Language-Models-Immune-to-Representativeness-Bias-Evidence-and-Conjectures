To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem using the given information.

Let:
- A = The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1 = The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2 = The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1 | A') = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2 | A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(B2 | A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A | B1, B2) = (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A)) / (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | A') * P(B2 | A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A | B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
