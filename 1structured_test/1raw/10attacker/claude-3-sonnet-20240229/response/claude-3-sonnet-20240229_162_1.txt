{probability: 0.84}

To explain:
1) From "a", we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

2) From "b", we know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.

3) Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(185 cm or taller | witness claim) = (P(witness claim | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller)) / P(witness claim)

Where:
P(witness claim | 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the accuracy rate of the first witness)
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (the prior probability)
P(witness claim) = P(witness claim | 185 cm or taller) * P(185 cm or taller) + P(witness claim | shorter than 185 cm) * P(shorter than 185 cm)
             = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 (using the false positive rate of 0.2 for the first witness)
             = 0.12 + 0.17
             = 0.29

Substituting the values:
P(185 cm or taller | witness claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.84

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is 0.84 or 84%.
