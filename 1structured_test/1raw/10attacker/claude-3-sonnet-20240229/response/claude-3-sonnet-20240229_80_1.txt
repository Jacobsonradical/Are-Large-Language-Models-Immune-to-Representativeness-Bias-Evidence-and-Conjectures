To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the provided information.

Given:
- P(Taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(Shorter) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(Witness1 correct | Taller) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(Witness1 incorrect | Shorter) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(Witness2 correct | Shorter) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a shorter person 70% of the time)
- P(Witness2 incorrect | Taller) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as shorter 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(Taller | Witness1 claims Taller) = (P(Witness1 claims Taller | Taller) × P(Taller)) / ((P(Witness1 claims Taller | Taller) × P(Taller)) + (P(Witness1 claims Taller | Shorter) × P(Shorter)))

P(Witness1 claims Taller | Taller) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(Witness1 claims Taller | Shorter) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall 20% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(Taller | Witness1 claims Taller) = (0.8 × 0.15) / ((0.8 × 0.15) + (0.2 × 0.85))
P(Taller | Witness1 claims Taller) ≈ 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.375 or 37.5%.
