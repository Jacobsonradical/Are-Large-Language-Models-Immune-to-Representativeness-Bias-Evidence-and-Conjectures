To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller from the population information, and we also have the likelihoods of the witnesses' claims given the attacker's height.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given information)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy for tall people)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (first witness's error rate for short people)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness's error rate for tall people)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (second witness's accuracy for short people)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 (or approximately 23.2%)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
