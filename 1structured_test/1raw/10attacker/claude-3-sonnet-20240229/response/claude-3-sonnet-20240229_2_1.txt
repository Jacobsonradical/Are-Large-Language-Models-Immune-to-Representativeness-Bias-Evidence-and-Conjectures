To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the statements of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 in the information.
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B1, B2|A) is the probability of the witnesses' statements given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B1, B2|~A) is the probability of the witnesses' statements given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(~B1|A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(~B2|~A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Assuming that the witnesses' statements are independent events, we can calculate:
P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.24
P(B1, B2|~A) = P(~B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) = 0.3 * 0.7 = 0.21

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = [0.24 * 0.15] / [0.24 * 0.15 + 0.21 * 0.85]
            = 0.0360 / 0.2175
            = 0.1655

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1655}
