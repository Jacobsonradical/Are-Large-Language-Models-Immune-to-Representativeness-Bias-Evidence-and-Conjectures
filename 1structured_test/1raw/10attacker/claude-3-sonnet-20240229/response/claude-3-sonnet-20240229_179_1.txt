To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (given in the information)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (given in the information)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (1 - 0.7, since the second witness was correct 70% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (given in the information)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (given in the information)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
