To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A^c) = 1 - P(B2|A^c) = 0.3 (first witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.2 (second witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1185

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.1185}
