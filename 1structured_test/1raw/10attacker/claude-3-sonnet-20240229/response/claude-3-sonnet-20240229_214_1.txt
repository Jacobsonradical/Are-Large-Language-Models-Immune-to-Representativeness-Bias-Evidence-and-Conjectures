To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as A, and the events of the first and second witnesses' claims as B1 and B2, respectively.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the claim of the first witness.

From the given information, we have:
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|A') = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1) as follows:

P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B1) = 0.4137931...

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.4137931}
