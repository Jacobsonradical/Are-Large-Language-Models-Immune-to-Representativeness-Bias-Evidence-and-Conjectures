To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem and consider the prior probability from the given population information, as well as the likelihood of each witness's testimony based on their assessed ability to judge height.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses.

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (likelihood that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (likelihood that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (likelihood that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (likelihood that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.3087 / (0.3087 + 0.0510)
            = 0.8580

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.8580}
