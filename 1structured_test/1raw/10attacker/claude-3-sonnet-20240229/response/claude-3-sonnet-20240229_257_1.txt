To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, with an accuracy of 80%.
- The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, with an accuracy of 70%.
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (inaccuracy of the second witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (inaccuracy of the first witness when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (accuracy of the second witness when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 (or approximately 23.2%)

{probability: 0.232}
