To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1,B2), the probability of A given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1,B2) = (P(B1,B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1,B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1,B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where A^c is the complement of A, i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|A^c) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B2|A^c) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
- P(B1,B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
- P(B1,B2|A^c) = P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1,B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            = 0.2322

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2322}
