To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

From the given information, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(C|A') = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, where A' is the complement of A)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B,C) as follows:

P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A') * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A') * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(C|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
         = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
         = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
