To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior information about the population.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a 185 cm or taller person 30% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (Given information: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter than 185 cm person 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a shorter than 185 cm person 70% of the time)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            ≈ 0.232

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.232}
