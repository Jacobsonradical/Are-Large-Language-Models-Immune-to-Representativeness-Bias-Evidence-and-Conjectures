To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the given evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events corresponding to the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C)]

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given by the population information)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
