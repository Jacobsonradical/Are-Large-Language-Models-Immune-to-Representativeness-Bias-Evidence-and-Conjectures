To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B,C) = [P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(C|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
P(A|B,C) ≈ 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
