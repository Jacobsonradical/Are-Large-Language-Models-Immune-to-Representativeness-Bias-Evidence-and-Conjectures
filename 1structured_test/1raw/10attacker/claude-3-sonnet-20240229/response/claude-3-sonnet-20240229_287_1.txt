To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the provided information.

Given:
- First witness's accuracy: 80% for identifying someone 185 cm or taller, and 20% error rate.
- Second witness's accuracy: 70% for identifying someone shorter than 185 cm, and 30% error rate.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).

P(B) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.7) * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.255
     = 0.375

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375
       = 0.32

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
