To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

From the provided information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the known values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.0756 / (0.0756 + 0.0510)
            = 0.597

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.597}
