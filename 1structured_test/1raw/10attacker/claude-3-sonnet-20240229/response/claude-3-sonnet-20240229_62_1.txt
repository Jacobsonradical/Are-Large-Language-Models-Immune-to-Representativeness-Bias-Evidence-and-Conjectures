To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where A^c represents the complement of event A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * (1 - 0.7) * 0.15) / (0.8 * (1 - 0.7) * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.232}
