{probability: 0.631578947368421}

To calculate this probability, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85) = 0.036 / 0.057 = 0.631578947368421

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.631578947368421 or approximately 63.16%.
