To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the information provided by the two witnesses.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the claims of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given information "a")
- P(~A) = 0.85 (given information "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (given information "b")
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (given information "b")
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (given information "b")
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (given information "b")

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
