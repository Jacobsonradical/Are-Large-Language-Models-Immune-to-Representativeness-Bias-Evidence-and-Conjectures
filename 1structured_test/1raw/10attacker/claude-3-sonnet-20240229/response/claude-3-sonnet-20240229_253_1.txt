To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem and the given information, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c)]

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given information "a")
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (given information "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (given information "b" for the first witness)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (given information "b" for the first witness)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (given information "b" for the second witness)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (given information "b" for the second witness)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
