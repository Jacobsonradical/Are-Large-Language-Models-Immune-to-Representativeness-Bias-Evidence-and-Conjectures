To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)

Substituting the values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
