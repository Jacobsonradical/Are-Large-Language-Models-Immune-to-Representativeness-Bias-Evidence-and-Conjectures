{probability: 0.4857142857142857}

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller as B.

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from "b": 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (from "a": the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (from "a": the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4857142857142857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.4857142857142857 or approximately 48.57%.
