{probability: 0.7619047619047619}

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (Given information "a")
- P(~A) = 0.85 (Given information "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (First witness's accuracy for heights ≥ 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (Second witness's error rate for heights ≥ 185 cm)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (First witness's error rate for heights < 185 cm)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (Second witness's accuracy for heights < 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.7619047619047619

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.7619 or 76.19%.
