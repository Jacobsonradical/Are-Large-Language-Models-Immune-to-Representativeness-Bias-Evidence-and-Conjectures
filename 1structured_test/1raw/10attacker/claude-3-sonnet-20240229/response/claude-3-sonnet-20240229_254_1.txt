To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A)]

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)]
            = 0.24 / (0.024 + 0.051)
            = 0.24 / 0.075
            = 0.32

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
