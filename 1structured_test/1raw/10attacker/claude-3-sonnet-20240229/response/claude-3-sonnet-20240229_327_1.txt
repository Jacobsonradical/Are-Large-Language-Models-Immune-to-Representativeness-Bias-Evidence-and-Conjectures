To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and combine the prior probability from the population data with the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given information:
- Prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller: P(H) = 0.15 (from "a")
- Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller: P(W1|H) = 0.8
- Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller: P(W1|¬H) = 0.2
- Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm: P(W2|¬H) = 0.7
- Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm: P(W2|H) = 0.3

We want to find P(H|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1, W2) = (P(W1|H) × P(W2|H) × P(H)) / (P(W1|H) × P(W2|H) × P(H) + P(W1|¬H) × P(W2|¬H) × P(¬H))

Substituting the values:
P(H|W1, W2) = (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
