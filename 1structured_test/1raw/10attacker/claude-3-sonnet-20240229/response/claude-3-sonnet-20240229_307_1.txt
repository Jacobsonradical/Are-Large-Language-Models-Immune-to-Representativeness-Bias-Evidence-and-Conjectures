To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior information about the population's height distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (complementary probability)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person 30% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            ≈ 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
