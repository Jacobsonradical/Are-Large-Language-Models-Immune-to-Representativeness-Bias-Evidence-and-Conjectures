To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the prior probability based on the evidence provided by the witnesses.

Given information:
- Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller: P(H) = 0.15 (from information "b")
- Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: P(¬H) = 0.85
- Probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller: P(E1|H) = 0.8
- Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm: P(E1|¬H) = 0.2
- Probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm: P(E2|¬H) = 0.7
- Probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller: P(E2|H) = 0.3

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the witnesses:

P(H|E1, E2) = (P(E1|H) × P(E2|H) × P(H)) / (P(E1|H) × P(E2|H) × P(H) + P(E1|¬H) × P(E2|¬H) × P(¬H))

Substituting the values:
P(H|E1, E2) = (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            ≈ 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, given the evidence from both witnesses, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
