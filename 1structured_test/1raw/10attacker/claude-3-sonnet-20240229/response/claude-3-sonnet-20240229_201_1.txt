To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in information "a")
- P(~A) = 0.85 (given in information "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (given in information "b")
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (given in information "b")
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (1 - P(B1|A))
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (1 - P(B2|~A))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
