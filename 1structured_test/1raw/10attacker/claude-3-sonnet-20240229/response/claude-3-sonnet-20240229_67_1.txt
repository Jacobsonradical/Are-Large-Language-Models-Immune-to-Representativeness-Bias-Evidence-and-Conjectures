{probability: 0.6, To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and let B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|~A) * P(A)) / ((P(B1|A) * P(B2|~A) * P(A)) + (P(B1|~A) * P(B2|A) * (1 - P(A))))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85))
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.6}
