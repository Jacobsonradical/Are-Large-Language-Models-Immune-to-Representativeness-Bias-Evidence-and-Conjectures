To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A)]

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate:
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.3 (the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Substituting the values in the formula:
P(A|B1, B2) = [(0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = [0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)]
            = 0.1185

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.1185}
