To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|¬A) = 1 - P(B2|¬A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (The first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (The second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1185 or approximately 11.85%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1185}
