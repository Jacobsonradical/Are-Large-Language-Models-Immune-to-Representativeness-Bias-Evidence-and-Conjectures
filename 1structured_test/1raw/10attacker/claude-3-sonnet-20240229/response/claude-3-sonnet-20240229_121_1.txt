To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) * P(~A)]

where ~A represents the complement of event A (i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a height of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a height shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a height shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a height of 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16
- P(B1, B2|~A) = P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.16 * 0.15) / [(0.16 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85)]
            = 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.119)
            = 0.24 / 0.359
            = 0.668 or 66.8%

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.668}
