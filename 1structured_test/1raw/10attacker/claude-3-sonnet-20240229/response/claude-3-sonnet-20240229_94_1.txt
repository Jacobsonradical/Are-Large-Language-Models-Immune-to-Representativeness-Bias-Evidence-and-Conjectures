To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.051)
            = 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.32}
