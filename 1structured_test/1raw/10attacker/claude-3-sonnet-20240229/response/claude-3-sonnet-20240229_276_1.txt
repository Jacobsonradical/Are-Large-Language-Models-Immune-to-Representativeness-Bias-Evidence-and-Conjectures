To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the events of the first and second witness's claims as B1 and B2, respectively.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2 | A') = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2 | A) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A | B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the claims of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A | B1, B2) = (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A)) / (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | A') * P(B2 | A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A | B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
