To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.063 / (0.063 + 0.051)
            = 0.553

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.553}
