To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the information provided by the two witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the statements of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
