To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Given:
- P(A): Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information "b")
- P(B|A): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(B|A'): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138
