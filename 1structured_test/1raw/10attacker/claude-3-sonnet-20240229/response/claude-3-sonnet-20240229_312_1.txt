To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem and combine the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / ((P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) + (P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A')))

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85))
            = 0.0756 / 0.1146
            = 0.6597

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6597}
