To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

From the given information, we have:

- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.1869

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.1869}
