To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
Let B1 be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Let B2 be the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem and the given information, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information about the population)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from the given information about the population)
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (from the first witness's accuracy)
P(B2|A) = 0.3 (from the second witness's error rate)
P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (from the first witness's error rate)
P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (from the second witness's accuracy)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232
