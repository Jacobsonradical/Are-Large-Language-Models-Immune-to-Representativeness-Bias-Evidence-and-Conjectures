To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior information about the population height distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (complement of P(A))
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy for tall people)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness's error rate for tall people)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (first witness's error rate for short people)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (second witness's accuracy for short people)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
