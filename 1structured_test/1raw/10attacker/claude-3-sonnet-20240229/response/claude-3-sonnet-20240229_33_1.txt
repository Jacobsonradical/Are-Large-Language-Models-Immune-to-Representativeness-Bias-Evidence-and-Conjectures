To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem statement)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (1 - P(A))
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85) ≈ 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
