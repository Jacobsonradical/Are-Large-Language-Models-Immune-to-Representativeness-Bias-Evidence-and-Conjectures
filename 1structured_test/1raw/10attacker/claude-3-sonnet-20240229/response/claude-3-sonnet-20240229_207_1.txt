{probability: 0.8181818181818182}

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            = 0.2323 / 0.2842
            = 0.8181818181818182

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.8181818181818182 or 81.82%.
