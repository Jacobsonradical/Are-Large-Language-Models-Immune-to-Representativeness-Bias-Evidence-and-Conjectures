To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the provided information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses.

From the provided information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
