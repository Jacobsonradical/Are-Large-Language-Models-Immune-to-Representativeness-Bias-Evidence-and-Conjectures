{probability: 0.5714285714285714}

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem using the given information.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A')]

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.063 / (0.063 + 0.051)
            = 0.063 / 0.114
            = 0.5714285714285714

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, given the conflicting witness statements and the population statistics, is approximately 0.5714285714285714 or 57.14%.
