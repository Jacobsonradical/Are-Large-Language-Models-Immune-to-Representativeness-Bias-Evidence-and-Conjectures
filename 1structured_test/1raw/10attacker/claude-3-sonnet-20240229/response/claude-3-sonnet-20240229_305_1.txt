To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.232}
