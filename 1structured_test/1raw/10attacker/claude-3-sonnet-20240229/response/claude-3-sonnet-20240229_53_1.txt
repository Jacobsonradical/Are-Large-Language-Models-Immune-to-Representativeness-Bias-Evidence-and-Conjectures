To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior probability of height distribution in the population.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) × P(B2|A) × P(A)) / (P(B1|A) × P(B2|A) × P(A) + P(B1|¬A) × P(B2|¬A) × P(¬A))

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values into the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 × 0.2 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.2 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.119)
            = 0.168 or approximately 16.8%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.168}
