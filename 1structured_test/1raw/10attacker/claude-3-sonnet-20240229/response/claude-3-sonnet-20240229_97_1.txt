To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.119)
            = 0.168 (or approximately 0.17)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.17}
