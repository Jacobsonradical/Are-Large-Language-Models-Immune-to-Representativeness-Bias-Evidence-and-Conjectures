To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
