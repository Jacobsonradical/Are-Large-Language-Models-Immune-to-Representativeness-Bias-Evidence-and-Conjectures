To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as A, and the events of the first and second witnesses' claims as B1 and B2, respectively.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 or 23.2%

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.232}
