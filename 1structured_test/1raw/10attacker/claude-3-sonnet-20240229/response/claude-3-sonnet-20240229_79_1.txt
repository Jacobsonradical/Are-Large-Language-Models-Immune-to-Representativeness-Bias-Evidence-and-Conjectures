To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 in the problem statement.
- P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as such.
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 is the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm.
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 is the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as such.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.2727 / (0.2727 + 0.119)
            = 0.6962

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6962}
