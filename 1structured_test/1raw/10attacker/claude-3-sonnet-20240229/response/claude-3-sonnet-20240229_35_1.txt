To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2|A) × P(A)] / [P(B1, B2|A) × P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) × P(¬A)]

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(¬B1|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.2
- P(¬B2|¬A) = 1 - P(B2|¬A) = 0.3
- P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) × P(B2|¬A) = 0.8 × 0.3 = 0.24
- P(B1, B2|¬A) = P(¬B1|A) × P(¬B2|¬A) = 0.2 × 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / [(0.24 × 0.15) + (0.14 × 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
