To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the provided information.

Given:
- The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller.
- The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time for people shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1,W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(W2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(W2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|W1,W2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
