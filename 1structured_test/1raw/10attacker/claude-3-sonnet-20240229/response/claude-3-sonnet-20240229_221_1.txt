To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.3 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.0288 / (0.0288 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1389

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1389}
