{probability: 0.8571}

Here's how I arrived at this estimate:

Let's define the following events:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B1 | A') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2 | A') = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(B2 | A) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)

We want to find P(A | B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A | B1, B2) = P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

We can calculate P(B1, B2 | A) and P(B1, B2 | A') as follows:
P(B1, B2 | A) = P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(B1, B2 | A') = P(B1 | A') * P(B2 | A') = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(B1, B2):
P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2 | A') * P(A')
           = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
           = 0.0360 + 0.1190 = 0.1550

Finally, we can calculate P(A | B1, B2):
P(A | B1, B2) = P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)
               = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.1550
               = 0.8571

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is 0.8571 or approximately 85.71%.
