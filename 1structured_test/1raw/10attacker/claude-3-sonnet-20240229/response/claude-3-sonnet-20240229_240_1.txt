To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time, where A^c is the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Substituting the known values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.0756 / (0.0756 + 0.0510)
            = 0.597

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.597}
