To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time for tall people)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time for short people)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time for tall people)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time for short people)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 or 23.2%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
