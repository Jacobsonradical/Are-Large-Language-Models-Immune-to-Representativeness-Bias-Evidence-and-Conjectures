To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
