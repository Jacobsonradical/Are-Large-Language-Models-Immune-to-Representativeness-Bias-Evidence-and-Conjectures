{probability: 0.6, To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the events of the first and second witness' statements as B1 and B2, respectively.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability of A given B1 and B2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(B2|not A) * P(not A)]

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness is 80% accurate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|not A) = 0.7 (second witness is 70% accurate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (first witness is 20% inaccurate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness is 30% inaccurate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 / 0.155
            = 0.6}
