To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.378

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.378}
