To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- The first witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time.
- The second witness correctly identifies heights 70% of the time.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1,B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1,B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A') * P(A'))

Where A' is the complement of A (the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm).

We know that:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A') = 1 - P(B2|A') = 0.3 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people 30% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.2 (the second witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the Bayes' theorem equation:
P(A|B1,B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1184

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.1184}
