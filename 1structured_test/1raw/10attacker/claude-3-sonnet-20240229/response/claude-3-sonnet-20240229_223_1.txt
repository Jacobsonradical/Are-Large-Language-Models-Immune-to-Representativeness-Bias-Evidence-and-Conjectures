To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events and allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
