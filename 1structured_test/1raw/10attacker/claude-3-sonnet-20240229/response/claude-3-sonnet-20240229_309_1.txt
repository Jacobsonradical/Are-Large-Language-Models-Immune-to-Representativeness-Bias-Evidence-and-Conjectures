To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. We have the following information:

- The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying a person's height as 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller as B.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population information.

P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)
     = 0.12 + 0.18
     = 0.3

Substituting the values in Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.3
       = 0.4

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is:

{probability: 0.4}
