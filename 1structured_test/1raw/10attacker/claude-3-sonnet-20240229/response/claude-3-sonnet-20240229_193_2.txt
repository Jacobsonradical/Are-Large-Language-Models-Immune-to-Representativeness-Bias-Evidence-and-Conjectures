To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the conditional probability of an event occurring, given prior knowledge or evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given in the population information)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
