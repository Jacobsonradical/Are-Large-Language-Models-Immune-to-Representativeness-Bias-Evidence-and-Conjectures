{probability: 0.6923076923076923}

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies 30% of the time)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies 70% of the time)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (from information "a")

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            = 0.2323 / 0.3354
            = 0.6923076923076923

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is 0.6923076923076923.
