To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to calculate the conditional probability of an event occurring, given some evidence and prior probabilities.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm, where A' is the complement of A)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.063 / (0.063 + 0.051)
            = 0.553

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.553}
