To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|~A) = 1 - P(B2|~A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the first witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the second witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values in the Bayes' theorem formula:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1185 or 11.85%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1185}
