To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the population statistics.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can calculate the remaining probabilities:
- P(B1|~A) = 1 - P(B2|~A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1186

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1186}
