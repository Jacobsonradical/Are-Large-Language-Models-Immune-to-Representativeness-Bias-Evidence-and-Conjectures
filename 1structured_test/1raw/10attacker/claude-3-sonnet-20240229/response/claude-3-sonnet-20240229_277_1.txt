To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events, and allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and the prior probability of height distribution in the population.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, given by the population distribution)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.232}
