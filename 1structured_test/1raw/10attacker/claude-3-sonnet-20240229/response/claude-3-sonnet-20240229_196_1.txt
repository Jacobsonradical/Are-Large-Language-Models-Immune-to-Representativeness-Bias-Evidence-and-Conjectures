To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the prior probability from the population data.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1, B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the information)
- P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies heights 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies heights 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85))
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
