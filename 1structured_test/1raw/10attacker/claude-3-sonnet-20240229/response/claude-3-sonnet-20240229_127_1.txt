To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events and allows us to update our beliefs in light of new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where A^c is the complement of event A (i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(B1|A^c) and P(B2|A), we use the fact that the probabilities of correct and incorrect identification must sum to 1:
- P(B1|A^c) = 1 - P(B2|A^c) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            = 0.1185

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1185}
