To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, given information)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^C) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
