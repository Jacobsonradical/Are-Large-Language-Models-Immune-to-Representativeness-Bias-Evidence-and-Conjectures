To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' statements.

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A^C) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A^C) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A) + P(B1|A^C) * P(B2|A^C) * P(A^C))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
            = 0.0756 / 0.1206
            = 0.6268

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6268}
