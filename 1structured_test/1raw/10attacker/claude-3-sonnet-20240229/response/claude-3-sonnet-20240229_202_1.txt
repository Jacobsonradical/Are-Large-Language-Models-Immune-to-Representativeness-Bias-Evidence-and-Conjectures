To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

From the given information, we have:
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies heights of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B2|A') = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies heights shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, where A' is the complement of A)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the given values, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 (approximately)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
