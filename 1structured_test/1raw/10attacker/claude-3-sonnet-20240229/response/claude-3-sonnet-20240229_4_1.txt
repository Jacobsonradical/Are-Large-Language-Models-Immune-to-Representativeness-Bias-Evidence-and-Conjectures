To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the provided information.

Given:
- Prior probability of being 185 cm or taller: P(H≥185) = 0.15
- Prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm: P(H<185) = 0.85
- Probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller: P(W1|H≥185) = 0.8
- Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm: P(W1|H<185) = 0.2
- Probability of the second witness correctly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm: P(W2|H<185) = 0.7
- Probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying someone 185 cm or taller: P(W2|H≥185) = 0.3

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(H≥185|W1) = (P(W1|H≥185) × P(H≥185)) / (P(W1|H≥185) × P(H≥185) + P(W1|H<185) × P(H<185))
            = (0.8 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85)
            = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
            = 0.414 or 41.4%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.414}
