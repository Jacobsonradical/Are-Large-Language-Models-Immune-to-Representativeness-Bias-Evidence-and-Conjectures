To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior information about the population heights.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the prior information)
- P(~A) = 0.85 (from the prior information)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.2941 or 29.41%

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2941}
