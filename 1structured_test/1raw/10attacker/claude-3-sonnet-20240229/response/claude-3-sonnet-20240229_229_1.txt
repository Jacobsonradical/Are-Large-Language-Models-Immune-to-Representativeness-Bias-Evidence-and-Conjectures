To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events based on the given evidence.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
