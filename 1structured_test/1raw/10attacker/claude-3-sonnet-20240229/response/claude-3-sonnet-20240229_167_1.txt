To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we need to use Bayes' theorem and the given information.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where A^c is the complement of event A (i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).

Given:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.232.
