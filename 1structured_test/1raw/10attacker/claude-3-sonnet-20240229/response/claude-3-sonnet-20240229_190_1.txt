To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (15%) in the problem statement.
- P(A^c) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).
- P(B1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B1|A^c) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(B2|A) is the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 (30%).
- P(B2|A^c) is the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is indeed shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 (70%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232 or 23.2%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
