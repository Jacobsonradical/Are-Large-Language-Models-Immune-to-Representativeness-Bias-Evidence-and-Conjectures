To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

From the given information, we have:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A')]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85]
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
