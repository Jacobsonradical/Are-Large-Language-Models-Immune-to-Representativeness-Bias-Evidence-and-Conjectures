To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness errs 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            ≈ 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
