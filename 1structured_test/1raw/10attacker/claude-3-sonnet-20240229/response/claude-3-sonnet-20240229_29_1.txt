To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given information from "a")
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (given information from "a")
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (given information from "b")
- P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (given information from "b")
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (given information from "b")
- P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (given information from "b")

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15)] / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]
            = 0.1755

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

{probability: 0.1755}
