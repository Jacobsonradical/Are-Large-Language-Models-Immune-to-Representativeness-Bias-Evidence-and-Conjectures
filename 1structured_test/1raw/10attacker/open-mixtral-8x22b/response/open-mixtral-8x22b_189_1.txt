To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, due to the contradictory witness statements, we can't directly apply Bayes' theorem. Instead, we can make a reasonable assumption that one witness is more reliable than the other based on their accuracy rates (80% vs 70%).

Let's assume that the first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is more reliable. To find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, we can use the witness's accuracy rate and the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population.

First, we calculate the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (P(W1|185+)):
P(W1|185+) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate)

Next, we calculate the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(185+)):
P(185+) = 0.15 (based on the population statistics)

Now, we can calculate the joint probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (P(W1, 185+)):
P(W1, 185+) = P(W1|185+) * P(185+)
P(W1, 185+) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, we must also consider the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (P(W1|185-)). This probability can be calculated as follows:
P(W1|185-) = 1 - P(W1|185+) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate)

The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(185-)) is:
P(185-) = 0.85 (based on population statistics)

The joint probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (P(W1, 185-)) is:
P(W1, 185-) = P(W1|185-) * P(185-)
P(W1, 185-) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate the total probability that the witness identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (P(W1)):
P(W1) = P(W1, 185+) + P(W1, 185-)
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed this (P(185+|W1)):
P(185+|W1) = P(W1, 185+) / P(W1)
P(185+|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
