To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witnesses and the population height distribution.

First, let's consider the prior probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. This is our base rate before considering any witness testimony.

Next, let's consider the witness testimonies. The first witness was able to correctly identify a person's height 80% of the time, and the second witness 70% of the time. However, since the witnesses contradict each other, we need to assess the probability that each witness is correct given their respective accuracy rates.

Let's denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm as P(¬H). Let's also denote the probability of the first witness being correct as P(W1|H) and the probability of the second witness being correct as P(W2|¬H).

We can calculate the likelihood ratio for each witness:

LR1 = P(W1|H) / P(W1|¬H) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4
LR2 = P(W2|¬H) / P(W2|H) = 0.7 / 0.3 = 2.33

The likelihood ratio represents how much more likely the observed evidence (the witness testimony) is under one hypothesis (e.g., the attacker being 185 cm or taller) than the other (e.g., the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimonies:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(H) * LR1 * LR2 / [P(H) * LR1 * LR2 + P(¬H) * (1/LR1) * (1/LR2)]

Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|W1, W2) = 0.15 * 4 * 2.33 / [0.15 * 4 * 2.33 + 0.85 * (1/4) * (1/2.33)]

Solving this equation, we get an estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller of approximately 0.60.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be:

{probability: 0.60}
