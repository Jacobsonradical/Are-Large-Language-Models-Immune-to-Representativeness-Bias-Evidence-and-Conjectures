To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence, in this case, the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- P(A) as the prior probability of A, which is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) as the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy)
- P(B|¬A) as the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20% error rate)
- P(¬A) as the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A))

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(A|B) ≈ 0.416

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.416.
