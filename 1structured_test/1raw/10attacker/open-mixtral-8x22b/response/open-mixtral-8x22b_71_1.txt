To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the population data, and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

First, let's denote the following:
- H: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- P(H): The prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(W1|H): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8).
- P(W1|not H): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm (0.2).
- P(W2|H): The probability that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (0.3).
- P(W2|not H): The probability that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height was indeed shorter than 185 cm (0.7).

We are interested in finding P(H|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) * P(H) / P(W1, W2)

To simplify the calculation, let's assume that the witness testimonies are independent given the attacker's height. This means that the probability of a witness's testimony does not change based on the other witness's testimony. This allows us to write:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H) / P(W1, W2)

Now, we can calculate P(W1, W2) using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) * P(H) + P(W1, W2|not H) * P(not H)

Since we assumed that the witness testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we can further simplify this:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H) + P(W1|not H) * P(W2|not H) * P(not H)

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller of approximately 0.58.
