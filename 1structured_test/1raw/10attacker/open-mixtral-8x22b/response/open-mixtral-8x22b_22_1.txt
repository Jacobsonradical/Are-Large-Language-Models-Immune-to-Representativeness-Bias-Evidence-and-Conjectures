To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability with new evidence. In this case, the evidence is the witnesses' testimonies.

First, let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following probabilities:
- P(A): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
  - From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15.
- P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
  - The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B1|A) = 0.80.
- P(B1|¬A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
  - The first witness makes an error 20% of the time, so P(B1|¬A) = 0.20.
- P(B2|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
  - The second witness makes an error 30% of the time, so P(B2|A) = 0.30.
- P(B2|¬A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
  - The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time, so P(B2|¬A) = 0.70.

Now, we want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

However, calculating P(B1, B2|A) and P(B1, B2) can be complex, as it involves considering the independence of the witnesses' testimonies. Instead, we can make a simplifying assumption that the witnesses' testimonies are conditionally independent given the attacker's height. This means that the first witness's testimony does not affect the second witness's testimony and vice versa. This allows us to simplify the calculation as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) / (P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Plugging in the values we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.30 \* 0.85))

Performing the calculation:

P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.472

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.472.
