To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller), given that the first witness claimed the attacker was tall.

Let T be the event that the attacker is tall, and F1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is tall. We want to find P(T|F1).

The prior probability that the attacker is tall is given by the population data, P(T) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall, given that the attacker is actually tall, is P(F1|T) = 0.80.

The likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall, given that the attacker is actually not tall, is P(F1|not T) = 0.20, since the witness is wrong 20% of the time.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is tall, given the first witness's claim:

P(T|F1) = P(F1|T) \* P(T) / P(F1)

We also need to find P(F1), the marginal probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall. To do this, we use the law of total probability:

P(F1) = P(F1|T) \* P(T) + P(F1|not T) \* P(not T)

P(F1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.31

Now we can find the posterior probability:

P(T|F1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.387.
