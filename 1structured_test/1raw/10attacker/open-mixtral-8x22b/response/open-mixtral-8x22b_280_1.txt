To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method to calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (H) given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller (W1).

Let P(H) be the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.

Let P(W1|H) be the probability that the first witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 according to the given information.

Let P(W1|~H) be the probability that the first witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 according to the given information.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1) as follows:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where P(~H) is the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 according to the given information.

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(H|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85] = 0.35

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.35 or 35%.
