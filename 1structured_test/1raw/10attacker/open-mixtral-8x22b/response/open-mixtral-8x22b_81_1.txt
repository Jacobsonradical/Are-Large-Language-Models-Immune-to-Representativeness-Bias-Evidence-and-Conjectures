To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)

First, let's calculate P(B,C|A), the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witnesses' judgments are independent, we can write:

P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A)

Now, let's calculate P(B|A) and P(C|A) using the given information:

- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80%, or 0.8.
- P(C|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 30%, or 0.3.

So, P(B,C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

Next, let's calculate P(A), the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Finally, we need to calculate P(B,C), the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims. We can write:

P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) + P(B,C|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know that P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, let's calculate P(B,C|¬A), the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B,C|¬A) = P(B|¬A) * P(C|¬A)

- P(B|¬A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 20%, or 0.2.
- P(C|¬A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 70%, or 0.7.

So, P(B,C|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Now we can calculate P(B,C):

P(B,C) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B,C):

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155 ≈ 0.232

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232, or 23.2%.
