To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the population distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller), and the new evidence consists of the witness testimonies.

Let's denote the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in finding P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that both witness testimonies are true.

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(A), which is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution:
P(A) = 0.15

Next, let's calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, divided by the probability that the first witness makes the same claim if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

LR = P(B|A) / P(B|¬A) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:
P(A|B) = P(A) \* LR / (P(A) \* LR + P(¬A) \* (1-LR))

P(A|B) = 0.15 \* 4 / (0.15 \* 4 + 0.85 \* (1-4))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.42

Now, let's consider the second witness's testimony. We can calculate the likelihood ratio for the second witness in a similar manner:
P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time)
P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

LR2 = P(C|A) / P(C|¬A) = 0.3 / 0.7 ≈ 0.43

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability P(A|B,C), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies:
P(A|B,C) = P(A|B) \* LR2 / (P(A|B) \* LR2 + P(¬A|B) \* (1-LR2))

P(A|B,C) ≈ 0.42 \* 0.43 / (0.42 \* 0.43 + 0.58 \* (1-0.43))
P(A|B,C) ≈ 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.24.
