To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on the evidence provided by the witnesses.

First, let's denote:
- P(T) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(~T) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- E1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- E2 as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(E1|T) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(E1|~T) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(E2|T) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 30% or 0.3.
- P(E2|~T) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

We want to find P(T|E1, E2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided by both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|T) \* P(T) / P(E1, E2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can write:

P(E1, E2|T) = P(E1|T) \* P(E2|T)
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|T) \* P(T) + P(E1, E2|~T) \* P(~T)

Now we can substitute the given values:

P(T|E1, E2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression gives us:

P(T|E1, E2) ≈ 0.135 / (0.135 + 0.119) ≈ 0.532

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.532.
