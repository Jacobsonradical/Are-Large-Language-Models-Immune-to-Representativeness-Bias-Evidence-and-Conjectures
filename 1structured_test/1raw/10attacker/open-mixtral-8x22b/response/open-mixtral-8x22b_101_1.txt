To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.15)
- P(B|A): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.80)
- P(B|~A): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.20)

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

where P(~A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.85).

Now, let's plug in the numbers:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))

P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41379

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41379 or 41.379%.
