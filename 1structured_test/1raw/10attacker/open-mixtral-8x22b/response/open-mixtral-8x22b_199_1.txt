To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).

We know the following:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (as mentioned above)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The first witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.315

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.315 â‰ˆ 0.38

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.38 or 38%.

Please note that this is an estimate and the actual probability may vary due to various factors not considered in this calculation.
