To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the population, and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

The prior probability P(A) is given as 15%, or 0.15, based on the population statistics.

The likelihood P(B1|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%, or 0.80.

The likelihood P(B2|~A) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, they are incorrect 30% of the time. Therefore, the probability that they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 30%, or 0.30. However, since we are interested in the case where the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm), we need the probability that the second witness is correct in this case, which is 70%, or 0.70.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|~A) * P(A) / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|~A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(B2|A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us an estimated probability of approximately 0.50, or 50%.

So, given the witness testimonies and the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the population, we estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller to be 50%.
