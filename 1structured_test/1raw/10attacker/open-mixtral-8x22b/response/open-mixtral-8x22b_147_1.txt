To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

First, we need to calculate P(B1|A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this is 80%, or 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate P(B1|~A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to the information provided, this is 20%, or 0.2.

We also need to know P(A), the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%, or 0.15, according to the information provided.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B1):

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)]

Solving this gives:

P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.692

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.692.
