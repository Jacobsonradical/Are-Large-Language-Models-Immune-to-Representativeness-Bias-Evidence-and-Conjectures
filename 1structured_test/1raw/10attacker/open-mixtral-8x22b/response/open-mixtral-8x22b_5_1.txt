To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote the following events:

A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.

P(B|A), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.

To calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬A) = 0.85.

P(B|¬A), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
