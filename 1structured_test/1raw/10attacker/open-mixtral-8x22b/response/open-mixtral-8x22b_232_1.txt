To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, we have two pieces of evidence (the witness testimonies) and a prior (the population height distribution).

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

First, let's calculate the prior probability, P(A), based on the city's population height distribution:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods, P(B1|A) and P(B2|A), based on the witness accuracy:
P(B1|A) = 0.80 (since the first witness is correct 80% of the time about people 185 cm or taller)
P(B2|A) = 0.30 (since the second witness is correct 30% of the time about people 185 cm or taller)

We also need to calculate the likelihoods of the witnesses being correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B1|¬A) = 0.20 (since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time about people shorter than 185 cm)
P(B2|¬A) = 0.70 (since the second witness is correct 70% of the time about people shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Assuming that the testimonies of the witnesses are independent given the attacker's height, we can simplify the expression:
P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) / (P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85))

Calculating the expression, we get:
P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.197

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.197.

Final answer: {probability: 0.197}
