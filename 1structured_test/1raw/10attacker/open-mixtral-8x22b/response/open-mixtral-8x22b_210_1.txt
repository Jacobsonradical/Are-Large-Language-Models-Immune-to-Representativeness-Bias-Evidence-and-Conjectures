To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
- P(B|~A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is the error rate of the first witness, 20% or 0.20.
- P(~A): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating the value:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
