To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Our prior probability (P(H)) is the probability that a random person chosen from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

We have two pieces of evidence (E1 and E2), one from each witness. According to Bayes' theorem, we can update our probability estimate as follows:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

Since the witnesses' observations are independent, we can simplify this to:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1) \* P(E2)

First, we need to calculate P(E1|H) and P(E2|H), which are the probabilities that each witness would make their claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(E1|H) = 0.8 (since the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, but since they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we use the error rate of 30%)

Now we can calculate P(E1) and P(E2), which are the probabilities that each witness would make their claim regardless of the attacker's height:

P(E1) = P(H) \* P(E1|H) + P(not H) \* P(E1|not H)
P(E2) = P(H) \* P(E2|H) + P(not H) \* P(E2|not H)

We already know P(H) and P(not H) (which is 85%), and we can calculate P(E1|not H) and P(E2|not H):

P(E1|not H) = 0.2 (since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(E2|not H) = 0.7 (since the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

Now we can plug in the values:

P(E1) = 0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(E2) = 0.15 \* 0.3 + 0.85 \* 0.7 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E1, E2):

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1) \* P(E2)
P(H|E1, E2) = 0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 / 0.29 \* 0.64
P(H|E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.33

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 33%.
