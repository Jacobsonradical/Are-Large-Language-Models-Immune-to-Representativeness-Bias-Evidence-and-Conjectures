To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬A) = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can use Bayes' theorem to express this probability as follows:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

The denominator P(W1, W2) is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims. This can be found by summing the probabilities of the two possible scenarios: either the attacker is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses make their respective claims, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and both witnesses make their respective claims.

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We can now calculate the numerator P(W1, W2|A) by multiplying the probabilities of the two witnesses' claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate the numerator P(W1, W2|¬A) by multiplying the probabilities of the two witnesses' claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1, W2|¬A) = P(W1|¬A) \* P(W2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the denominator P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 = 0.2297

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.23.
