To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability in the population and the reliability of the witnesses.

The prior probability (Prior) that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, based on the given information.

The reliability of the first witness (Witness1) is 80%, or 0.8, and the reliability of the second witness (Witness2) is 70%, or 0.7.

To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Posterior = (Prior * Likelihood) / Evidence

where Likelihood is the probability of observing the witness testimonies given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and Evidence is the probability of observing the witness testimonies.

Since the witnesses make independent observations, we can multiply their reliability to find the Likelihood:

Likelihood = Witness1 * (1 - Witness2) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.24

The Evidence is the probability of observing the witness testimonies regardless of the attacker's height:

Evidence = (Prior * Likelihood) + ((1 - Prior) * (1 - Likelihood))

Evidence = (0.15 * 0.24) + ((1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.24)) = 0.306

Finally, we can compute the Posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

Posterior = (Prior * Likelihood) / Evidence = (0.15 * 0.24) / 0.306 â‰ˆ 0.1176

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1176.
