To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's claim as W1 (for the first witness).

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We are given that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We don't know P(W1), the probability that the first witness makes this claim. However, we can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm), and P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller).

So:

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.23

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.52

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.52 or 52%.
