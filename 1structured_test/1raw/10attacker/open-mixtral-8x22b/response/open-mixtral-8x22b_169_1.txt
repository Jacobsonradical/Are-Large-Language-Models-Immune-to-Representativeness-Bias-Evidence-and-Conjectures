To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given another event B is equal to the probability of B given A, times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, let event A be the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and event B be the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to calculate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the first witness making the claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.

We also need to calculate the likelihood of the first witness making the claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(B) can be calculated as the sum of the likelihood of the first witness making the claim given the attacker was 185 cm or taller, times the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, plus the likelihood of the first witness making the claim given the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, times the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.3

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.4

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.4 or 40%.
