To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (H) given that the first witness claimed it was (W1).

Here's the breakdown of the probabilities involved:

1. P(H): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. P(not H): The probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. P(W1 | H): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
4. P(W1 | not H): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.20.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(H | W1) = [P(W1 | H) * P(H)] / [P(W1 | H) * P(H) + P(W1 | not H) * P(not H)]

Substituting the values from above:

P(H | W1) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(H | W1) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H | W1) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H | W1) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41, given the first witness's claim.
