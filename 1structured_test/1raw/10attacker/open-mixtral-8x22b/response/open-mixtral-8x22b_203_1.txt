To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's denote the following:
- Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let B2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's start with the prior probability, P(A), which is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 15%.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods, P(B1|A) and P(B2|¬A), where ¬A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B1|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 80%.

P(B2|¬A) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm. According to the information given, this is 70%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Assuming that the testimonies of the two witnesses are independent, we can simplify this to:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A)P(B2|A)P(A) / [P(B1|A)P(B2|A)P(A) + P(B1|¬A)P(B2|¬A)P(¬A)]

We already know P(A), P(B1|A), and P(B2|¬A). We also know that P(¬A) is the probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

We still need to find P(B1|¬A) and P(B2|A). P(B1|¬A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. According to the information given, this is 20% (the error rate of the first witness). Similarly, P(B2|A) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 30% (the error rate of the second witness).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives a probability of approximately 0.56, or 56%.

So, based on the given information and the assumption of independence between the two witnesses' testimonies, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 56%.
