To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, we have the prior probability (P(H)) that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

Next, we have the likelihood of witness 1 being correct (P(E1|H)), which is 80% or 0.80, and the likelihood of witness 1 being incorrect (P(E1|¬H)), which is 20% or 0.20. Similarly, we have the likelihood of witness 2 being correct (P(E2|¬H)), which is 70% or 0.70, and the likelihood of witness 2 being incorrect (P(E2|H)), which is 30% or 0.30.

We can define the event of interest as H (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and its complement as ¬H (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We have two pieces of evidence, E1 (witness 1's claim) and E2 (witness 2's claim), which are independent given H and ¬H.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E1,E2) as follows:

P(H|E1,E2) = P(E1,E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1,E2)

Since E1 and E2 are independent given H and ¬H, we can simplify the calculation as:

P(H|E1,E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1,E2)

Now, we calculate the probability of the evidence given the complement of H (P(E1,E2|¬H)):

P(E1,E2|¬H) = P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability using the law of total probability:

P(H|E1,E2) = P(E1,E2|H) \* P(H) / (P(E1,E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1,E2|¬H) \* P(¬H))

Plugging in the given values:

P(H|E1,E2) = 0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.30 \* 0.85)

P(H|E1,E2) ≈ 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.64 or 64%.
