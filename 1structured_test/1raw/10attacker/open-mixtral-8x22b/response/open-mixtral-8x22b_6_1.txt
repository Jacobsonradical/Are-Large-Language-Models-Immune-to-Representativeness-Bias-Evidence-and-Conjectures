To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following information:

- P(A): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.80.
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the first witness is wrong (claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter) is 20% or 0.20.
- P(¬A): The probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.

First, let's find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct, or the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm and the witness is wrong. So,

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
