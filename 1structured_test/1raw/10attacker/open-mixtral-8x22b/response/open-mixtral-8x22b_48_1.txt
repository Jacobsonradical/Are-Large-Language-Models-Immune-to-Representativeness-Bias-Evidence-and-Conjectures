To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Our prior probability is based on the information given in "b": in the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, before considering the witness statements, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the witness statements. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let E1 and E2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) \* P(A) / P(E1, E2).

We know P(A) = 0.15. Now we need to find P(E1, E2|A), the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(E1, E2), the overall probability that both witnesses make their respective claims.

Since the witnesses' statements are independent, P(E1, E2|A) = P(E1|A) \* P(E2|A). According to the information given in "a", the first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, and the second witness identifies the correct height 70% of the time. Therefore, P(E1|A) = 0.8 and P(E2|A) = 0.7. Thus, P(E1, E2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56.

To find P(E1, E2), we need to consider all possible combinations of witness statements and attacker heights. However, since we are only interested in the scenario where both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can ignore the other combinations. Therefore, P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) \* P(A) + P(E1, E2|not A) \* P(not A).

We already know P(E1, E2|A) \* P(A) = 0.56 \* 0.15 = 0.084. Now we need to find P(E1, E2|not A), the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as P(E1|not A) \* P(E2|not A), where P(E1|not A) is the probability that the first witness erroneously claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (20% of the time), and P(E2|not A) is the probability that the second witness erroneously claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (30% of the time). Therefore, P(E1, E2|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06.

Since P(not A) = 0.85, P(E1, E2|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.06 \* 0.85 = 0.051.

Therefore, P(E1, E2) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135.

Finally, we can find P(A|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) \* P(A) / P(E1, E2) = 0.56 \* 0.15 / 0.135 = 0.659.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.659.
