To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people in the population with that height and the reliability of the witnesses.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

We know that P(A) = 0.15, which is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

Let's denote the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller as P(W1|A) = 0.8, and the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller as P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W1) as follows:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we can substitute the values:

P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

P(A|W1) ≈ 0.42857

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.42857 or 42.857%.
