To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter.

Let's denote:
H as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
E1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
E2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find the probability of H given both E1 and E2:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H)P(H) / P(E1, E2)

First, let's find P(E1, E2|H), the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witnesses are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H)P(E2|H)

From the given information, we know that:
P(E1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the height is actually 185 cm or taller)

So, P(E1, E2|H) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Next, let's find P(E1, E2), the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims. This is the sum of the probabilities of both witnesses making their claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H)P(H) + P(E1, E2|not H)P(not H)

We already know P(E1, E2|H), P(H), and P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. We need to find P(E1, E2|not H), the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(E1, E2|not H) = P(E1|not H)P(E2|not H)

Again, from the given information, we know that:
P(E1|not H) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(E2|not H) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

So, P(E1, E2|not H) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can find P(E1, E2):

P(E1, E2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H)P(H) / P(E1, E2)
P(H|E1, E2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.23

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.23 or 23%.
