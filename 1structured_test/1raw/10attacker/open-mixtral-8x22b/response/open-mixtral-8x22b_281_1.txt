To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed it was. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where ¬A denotes the complement of A, i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this event is:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We are also given that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height in 20% of cases. Therefore, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is:

P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85

Now we can compute P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can compute P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
