To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the proportion of people in the population who are 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15), and the new evidence comes from the witness testimonies.

Let's denote the following:

- A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know that:

- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A)

Here, P(~A) is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85. P(B|~A) is the probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller when the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 41.38%.
