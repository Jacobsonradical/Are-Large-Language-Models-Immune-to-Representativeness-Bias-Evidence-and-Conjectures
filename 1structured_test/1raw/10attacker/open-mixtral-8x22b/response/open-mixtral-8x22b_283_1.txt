To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed that it was.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know from the problem statement that P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. We also know that P(A) is the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the first witness is correct and where they are incorrect. If the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, then the first witness would be correct 80% of the time, and incorrect 20% of the time. If the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, then the first witness would be incorrect 20% of the time.

So we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can plug our values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.

Answer:
{probability: 0.41}
