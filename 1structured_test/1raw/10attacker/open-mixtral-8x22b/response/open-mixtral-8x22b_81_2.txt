To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability and the witness testimonies.

The prior probability, based on the city's population distribution, is that the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height and a 20% chance of making an error. The second witness has a 70% chance of correctly identifying a person's height and a 30% chance of making an error.

Since the witnesses contradict each other, we need to weigh their testimonies based on their accuracy. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, but for simplicity, let's approximate the combined testimony as follows:

If the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the first witness is correct and a 20% chance the second witness is correct. If the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance the second witness is correct and a 30% chance the first witness is correct.

However, these probabilities are not independent, so we can't simply multiply them. Instead, we can use the following reasoning:

- If the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness is correct is 0.8, and the probability that the second witness is incorrect is 0.3. So the combined probability is approximately 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.
- If the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the first witness is incorrect is 0.2, and the probability that the second witness is correct is 0.7. So the combined probability is approximately 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Now, we need to normalize these probabilities to ensure they sum up to 1:

- Normalized probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller: 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.14) = 0.63
- Normalized probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm: 0.14 / (0.24 + 0.14) = 0.37

Finally, we can combine the prior probability with the normalized probabilities to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

- Prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller: 0.15
- Conditional probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies: 0.63

Using Bayes' theorem, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

0.15 * 0.63 / (0.15 * 0.63 + 0.85 * 0.37) = 0.28

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.28 or 28%.
