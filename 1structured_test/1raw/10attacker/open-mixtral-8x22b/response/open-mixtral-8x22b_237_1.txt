To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were 185 cm or taller.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
P(B|¬A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
