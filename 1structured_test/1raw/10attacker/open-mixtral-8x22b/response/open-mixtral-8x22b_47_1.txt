To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (based on population statistics) with new evidence (witness testimonies).

First, let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Our prior probability P(A) is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

Now, we need to find the likelihood P(B1|A) and P(B2|~A), where ~A denotes the complement of A (i.e., the attacker being shorter than 185 cm). These probabilities represent the accuracy of the witnesses' testimonies given the actual height of the attacker. According to the information provided:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

The posterior probability P(A|B1, B2) can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|~A) \* P(A) / [P(B1|A) \* P(B2|~A) \* P(A) + P(B1|~A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(~A)]

We know that P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time), P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time), and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = 0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.3 \* 0.85)

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.61

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.61.
