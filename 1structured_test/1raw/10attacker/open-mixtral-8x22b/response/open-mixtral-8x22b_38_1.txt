To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

The prior probability for the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, based on the given population distribution.

Let's denote the event that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as E1, and the event that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as E2.

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

We can simplify this by assuming that the witnesses' observations are independent given the attacker's true height. This allows us to write:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|~H) \* P(H) / [(P(E1|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(~H)) \* (P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E2|~H) \* P(~H))]

Now we can plug in the given values:

P(E1|H) = 0.8 (first witness correct about 80% of the time)
P(E1|~H) = 0.2 (first witness incorrect about 20% of the time)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (second witness incorrect about 30% of the time)
P(E2|~H) = 0.7 (second witness correct about 70% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

After calculating the values, we find that:

P(H|E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.52

So, based on the given information and assuming independence between the witnesses' observations, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52.
