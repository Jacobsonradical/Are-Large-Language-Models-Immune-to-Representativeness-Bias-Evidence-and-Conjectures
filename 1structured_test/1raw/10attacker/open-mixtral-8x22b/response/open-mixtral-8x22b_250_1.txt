To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probabilities based on the witness testimonies.

Given the information:
- Prior probability (P(H)): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- Witness 1 accuracy (P(E1|H)): Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
- Witness 1 false positive rate (P(E1|~H)): Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2
- Witness 2 accuracy (P(E2|~H)): Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 70% = 0.7
- Witness 2 false negative rate (P(E2|H)): Probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 30% = 0.3

We are interested in finding the posterior probability (P(H|E1, E2)): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given witness 1's and witness 2's testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) * P(H)] / [P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) * P(H) + P(E1|~H) * P(E2|~H) * P(~H)]

P(H|E1, E2) = [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85]

P(H|E1, E2) ≈ 0.036 / [0.036 + 0.119]

P(H|E1, E2) ≈ 0.036 / 0.155

P(H|E1, E2) ≈ 0.232

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
