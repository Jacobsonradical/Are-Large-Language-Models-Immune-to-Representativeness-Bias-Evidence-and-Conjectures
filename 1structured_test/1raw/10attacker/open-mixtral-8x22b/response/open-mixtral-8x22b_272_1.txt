To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness testimonies and their accuracy in assessing height, as well as the general height distribution in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as P(A).

Witness 1 claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. So, the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is tall is 0.8. Similarly, Witness 2 claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time. So, the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is short is 0.7.

The prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15, and the prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness testimonies:

P(A | Witness 1) ∝ P(Witness 1 | A) * P(A)
P(A | Witness 1) ∝ 0.8 * 0.15

P(not A | Witness 2) ∝ P(Witness 2 | not A) * P(not A)
P(not A | Witness 2) ∝ 0.7 * 0.85

Now, we need to normalize these probabilities to ensure they sum up to 1:

P(A | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = P(A | Witness 1) / (P(A | Witness 1) + P(not A | Witness 2))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85))

P(A | Witness 1 and Witness 2) ≈ 0.192 / (0.192 + 0.595)

P(A | Witness 1 and Witness 2) ≈ 0.243

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.243.
