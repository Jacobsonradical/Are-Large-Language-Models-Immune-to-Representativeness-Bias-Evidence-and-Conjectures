To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote the event "the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller" as A, and the evidence from the first witness as W1 and the second witness as W2. The prior probability P(A) is 0.15, based on the information that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

The likelihoods of the witnesses' testimonies given the height of the attacker can be calculated from the provided information. For the first witness, we have:

P(W1 | A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(W1 | not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

Similarly, for the second witness:

P(W2 | A) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2 | not A) = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A | W1, W2) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can factor the likelihood term as:

P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \* P(W2 | A)

We can also express the denominator as:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2 | not A) \* P(not A)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A | W1, W2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:

P(A | W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.29

So, based on the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.29.
