To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

First, we compute the prior probability P(A) using the information about the population's height distribution:

P(A) = 0.15

Next, we need to compute the likelihoods P(B1|A) and P(B2|~A) and the complements P(B1|~A) and P(B2|A). Here, ~A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using the witnesses' accuracy:

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Since B1 and B2 are conditionally independent given A, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

The denominator P(B1, B2) can be computed as:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) * P(~A)

The probabilities P(B1, B2|~A) and P(B1, B2|A) can be computed using the conditional independence of B1 and B2 given A:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A)
P(B1, B2|~A) = P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A)

Plugging in the values:

P(B1, B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(B1, B2|~A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can compute P(B1, B2):

P(B1, B2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.12025 = 0.15625

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.15625 = 0.036 / 0.15625 â‰ˆ 0.23

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.23.
