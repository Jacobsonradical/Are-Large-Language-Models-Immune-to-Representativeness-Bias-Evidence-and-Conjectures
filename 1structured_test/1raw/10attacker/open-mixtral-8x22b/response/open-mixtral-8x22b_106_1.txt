To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the posterior probability given the information from both witnesses and the population height distribution.

Let's denote:
A: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness is correct
W2: the event that the second witness is correct

We are given the following probabilities:
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬A) = 0.7 (probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W1, W2):

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

To calculate P(W1, W2|A), we assume independence between the witnesses' testimonies:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate P(W1, W2|¬A):

P(W1, W2|¬A) = P(W1|¬A) \* P(W2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we find P(W1, W2) by using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85
= 0.036 + 0.119
= 0.155

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W1, W2):

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)
= 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155
≈ 0.229

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, is approximately 0.229 or 22.9%.
