To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior belief is the population distribution of heights (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- C: Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claimed the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) / P(B,C)

We can calculate P(B,C|A) by considering the witnesses' accuracies and the fact that they are independent of each other:

P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A)

We know that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. Similarly, Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so P(C|A) = 0.3 (since Witness 2 is correct when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, let's calculate P(A), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)

To find P(B,C), we need to consider both possibilities (A and not A) and sum the probabilities:

P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) + P(B,C|not A) \* P(not A)

P(B,C|not A) is the probability that both witnesses are correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B,C|not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(C|not A)

Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so P(C|not A) = 0.7.

Now, let's calculate P(not A), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(not A) = 0.85 (from the population distribution)

Finally, we can calculate P(B,C):

P(B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)

Now we can find P(A|B,C):

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / P(B,C)

After calculating P(B,C) and substituting the values, we find:

P(A|B,C) â‰ˆ 0.224

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.224.
