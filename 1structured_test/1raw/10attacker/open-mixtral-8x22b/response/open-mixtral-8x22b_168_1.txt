To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given that we have two witnesses with different accuracy in identifying heights, we can calculate the posterior probability based on their testimonies and the prior probability of someone being taller than 185 cm in the city.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The prior probability P(A) is given as 15%.

The likelihood P(B1|A) is 80%, as the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. The likelihood P(B2|A') is 70%, as the second witness identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy. Here, A' denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we need to find P(B1|A') and P(B2|A). Since the first witness is 80% accurate, they will be wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Thus, P(B1|A') = 20%. Similarly, when the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(B2|A) = 30%.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

We can simplify this using the independence of witnesses:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A') * P(A')]

Now, plug in the values:

P(A|B1, B2) = 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85]

P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.435

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 43.5%.

{probability: 0.435}
