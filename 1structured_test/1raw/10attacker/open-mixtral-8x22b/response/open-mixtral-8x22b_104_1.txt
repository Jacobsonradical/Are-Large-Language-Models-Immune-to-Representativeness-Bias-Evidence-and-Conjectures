To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability and the witness testimonies.

The prior probability, based on the population height distribution, is that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

If the first witness is correct, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). If the first witness is incorrect, we still have to consider the second witness's testimony. If the second witness is correct, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7 (the second witness's accuracy). However, since we're interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that the second witness is incorrect, which is 0.3.

So, we have two scenarios:

1. The first witness is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is incorrect, but the second witness is also incorrect, and the attacker is still 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the first scenario is:
0.8 (first witness accuracy) * 0.15 (prior probability) = 0.12

The probability of the second scenario is:
0.2 (first witness error rate) * 0.3 (second witness error rate) * 0.15 (prior probability) = 0.009

Adding these probabilities together gives us an estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
0.12 + 0.009 = 0.129

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior probability, is approximately 0.129.
