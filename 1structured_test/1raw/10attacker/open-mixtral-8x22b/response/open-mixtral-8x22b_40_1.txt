To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.80).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.20, since the first witness was wrong 20% of the time).
- P(~A): The prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.096 / 0.266
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.

Final answer in the required format:
{probability: 0.36}
