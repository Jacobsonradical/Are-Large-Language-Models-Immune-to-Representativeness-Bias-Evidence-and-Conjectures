To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (based on the population statistics) with new evidence (the witness testimonies).

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15 based on the population statistics).
- P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (0.80 based on the first witness's accuracy).
- P(B2|¬A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm (0.70 based on the second witness's accuracy).

We want to find P(A|B1 ∩ B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(A|B1 ∩ B2) = P(B1 ∩ B2|A)P(A) / P(B1 ∩ B2)

We need to find P(B1 ∩ B2|A) and P(B1 ∩ B2).

P(B1 ∩ B2|A) = P(B1|A)P(B2|A) (assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height).

P(B2|A) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as 1 - P(B2|¬A) = 0.30 (since the second witness is wrong 30% of the time).

So, P(B1 ∩ B2|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24.

To find P(B1 ∩ B2), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height:

P(B1 ∩ B2) = P(B1 ∩ B2|A)P(A) + P(B1 ∩ B2|¬A)P(¬A)

P(B1 ∩ B2|¬A) is the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate this as P(B1|¬A)P(B2|¬A) = (1 - P(B1|A))(P(B2|¬A)) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14.

P(¬A) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85 based on the population statistics).

So, P(B1 ∩ B2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155.

Finally, we can find P(A|B1 ∩ B2):

P(A|B1 ∩ B2) = P(B1 ∩ B2|A)P(A) / P(B1 ∩ B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 ≈ 0.228.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.228, or 22.8%.
