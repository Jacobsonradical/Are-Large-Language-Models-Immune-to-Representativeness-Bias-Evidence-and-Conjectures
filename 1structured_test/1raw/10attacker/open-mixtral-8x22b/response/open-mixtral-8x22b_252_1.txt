To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the witness testimonies.

First, let's define our events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (P(A)) is given as 15%.

Now, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall. From the given information, we know that the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.80.

To find P(B|not A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we use the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
