To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is particularly useful when we want to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population distribution of heights, and the new evidence is the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- H as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W1 as the event "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W2 as the event "the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- P(H) as the prior probability of H
- P(W1|H) as the probability of W1 given H (the first witness's accuracy when H is true)
- P(W1|~H) as the probability of W1 given not H (the first witness's error rate when H is false)
- P(~H) as the prior probability of not H
- P(W2|H) as the probability of W2 given H (the second witness's error rate when H is true)
- P(W2|~H) as the probability of W2 given not H (the second witness's accuracy when H is false)

We are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(W2|H) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
- P(W2|~H) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the updated probability of H given the witnesses' testimonies:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1,W2) = 0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85]

Now, let's calculate the value:

P(H|W1,W2) ≈ 0.184 / [0.184 + 0.119] ≈ 0.61

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.61, or 61%.

Answer: {probability: 0.61}
