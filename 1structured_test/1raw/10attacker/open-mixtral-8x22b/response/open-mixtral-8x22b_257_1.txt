To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability using new evidence.

First, let's consider our prior probability. Based on the population statistics, the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies. We have two witnesses, each with a different accuracy rate. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time.

The probability that both witnesses are correct is:
0.8 (first witness accuracy) * 0.7 (second witness accuracy) = 0.56

The probability that both witnesses are incorrect is:
0.2 (first witness error rate) * 0.3 (second witness error rate) = 0.06

However, since the witnesses gave conflicting testimonies, we need to consider the scenario where one witness is correct and the other is not.

The probability that the first witness is correct and the second is not is:
0.8 (first witness accuracy) * 0.3 (second witness error rate) = 0.24

The probability that the second witness is correct and the first is not is:
0.2 (first witness error rate) * 0.7 (second witness accuracy) = 0.14

Now, let's consider these probabilities in the context of the witnesses' testimonies. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is the sum of the probabilities where the first witness is correct:
0.56 (both correct) + 0.24 (first correct, second incorrect) = 0.80

The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given the second witness's testimony, is the sum of the probabilities where the second witness is correct:
0.56 (both correct) + 0.14 (second correct, first incorrect) = 0.70

However, we need to normalize these probabilities to sum to 1. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities where either witness is correct:
0.80 (first correct) + 0.70 (second correct) - 0.56 (both correct) = 0.94

Now, we can find the normalized probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
0.80 / 0.94 â‰ˆ 0.851

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.851.
