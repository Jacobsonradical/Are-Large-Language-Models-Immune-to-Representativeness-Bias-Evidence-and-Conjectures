To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability given the evidence (witness testimonies).

First, let's define our initial probability (Prior):
P(A) = Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies as evidence E1 (witness 1) and E2 (witness 2).

P(E1|A) = Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(E2|A) = Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm = 0.7

Since we are interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we will focus on witness 1's testimony.

P(E1|~A) = Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E1) = P(E1|A) * P(A) / (P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|~A) * P(~A))

We know that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|E1) â‰ˆ 0.42857

So, based on this calculation, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's testimony, is approximately 0.42857.

However, we should also consider that we have two conflicting testimonies. In this case, we can't directly combine the probabilities from both witnesses without taking into account their reliability and the independence of their testimonies. Since we don't have enough information to do that, we will focus on the first witness's testimony.
