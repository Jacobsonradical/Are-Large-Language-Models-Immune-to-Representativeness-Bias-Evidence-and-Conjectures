To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

where:
- H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- E is the evidence that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- P(H|E) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim.
- P(E|H) is the probability that the witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the given information about the population.
- P(E) is the overall probability of the witness making the claim, which can be calculated as P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H), where ~H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that P(E|H) = 0.8 (the first witness was able to identify the correct height 80% of the time), and P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). We also know that P(E|~H) = 0.2, because the first witness erred 20% of the time when identifying people shorter than 185 cm.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

P(H|E) = [0.12] / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
