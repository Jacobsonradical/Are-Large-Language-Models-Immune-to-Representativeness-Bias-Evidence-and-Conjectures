To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probabilities based on new evidence.

First, let's define our events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Our prior probability P(A) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

Now, we need to calculate the likelihood P(B|A), which is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time under similar conditions. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, we calculate P(B|~A), which is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness makes an error 20% of the time, P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.4348

So, given the evidence from the first witness, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4348 or 43.48%.
