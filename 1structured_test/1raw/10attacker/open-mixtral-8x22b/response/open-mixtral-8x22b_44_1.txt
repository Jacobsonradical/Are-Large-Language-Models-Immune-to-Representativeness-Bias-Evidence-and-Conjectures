To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the population distribution and the witness testimonies.

1. Population distribution:
Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can say that the prior probability (P(H)) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

2. Witness testimonies:
The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time (P(E1|H) = 0.8) and wrong 20% of the time (P(E1|~H) = 0.2).
The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time (P(E2|~H) = 0.7) and wrong 30% of the time (P(E2|H) = 0.3).

Assuming the witness testimonies are independent, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) / P(E1, E2)

However, since we are only interested in the first witness's claim, we can simplify this to:

P(H|E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) / P(E1)

Where P(E1) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This can be calculated by considering both the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and where they are not:

P(E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) + P(E1|~H) * P(~H)

Plugging in the values we have:

P(E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.31

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(H|E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387

So, given the first witness's claim and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.387.
