To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probabilities with new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the population height distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
D1 - The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
D2 - The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1 - The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
W2 - The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W3 - The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
W4 - The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

First, we calculate P(D2), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(D2) = 0.15

Next, we calculate P(W2|D2), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:
P(W2|D2) = 0.8 (80% accuracy)

Now, we calculate P(W2|D1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(W2|D1) = 0.2 (20% error rate)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(D2|W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

P(D2|W2) = [P(W2|D2) * P(D2)] / [P(W2|D2) * P(D2) + P(W2|D1) * P(D1)]

Plugging in the values:
P(D2|W2) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:
P(D2|W2) â‰ˆ 0.4348

So, given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 43.48%.
