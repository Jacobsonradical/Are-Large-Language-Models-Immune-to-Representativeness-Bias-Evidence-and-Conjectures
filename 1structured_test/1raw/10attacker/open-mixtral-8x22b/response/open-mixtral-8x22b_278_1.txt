To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability given some evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the population distribution of heights (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the evidence is the witness statements.

Let's denote the following:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

To calculate P(B), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

So, given the information provided and based on our calculations, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41, or 41%.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
{probability: 0.41}
