To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- E1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- E2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- P(H) as the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15, given in the problem).

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(H|E1, E2) can be calculated as:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

We are interested in P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

We are given:

- P(E1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller).
- P(E2|¬H) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm).
- P(¬H) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm).

Since the witnesses' claims are independent, we can write:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)

We do not have P(E2|H), but we can use P(E2|¬H) and the fact that the second witness is wrong 30% of the time:

P(E2|H) = 1 - P(¬E2|H) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 (the second witness incorrectly claims the height is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller).

Now we can calculate P(E1, E2|H):

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56

The probability P(E1, E2) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We do not have P(E1, E2|¬H), but we can use P(E1|¬H) and P(E2|¬H):

P(E1, E2|¬H) = P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) = (1 - 0.8) \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate P(E1, E2):

P(E1, E2) = 0.56 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.233

Finally, we can calculate P(H|E1, E2):

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2) = 0.56 \* 0.15 / 0.233 ≈ 0.3605

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3605.
