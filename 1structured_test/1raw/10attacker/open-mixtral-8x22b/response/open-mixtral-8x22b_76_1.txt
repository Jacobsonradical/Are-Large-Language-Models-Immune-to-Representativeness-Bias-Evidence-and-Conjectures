To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm, as given in "b".

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

We can calculate P(A|B1, B2) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Since we don't have information on the joint probability P(B1, B2), we'll use a simplifying assumption that the witness testimonies are conditionally independent given the attacker's height. This means that P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A).

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80%, or 0.8.
2. P(B2|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the error rate of the second witness, which is 30%, or 0.3.
3. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%, or 0.15.

Now we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)
= 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 / P(B1, B2)

To find P(B1, B2), we use the law of total probability:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) * P(~A)

Where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We don't have the exact numbers for P(B1, B2|~A), so we'll use the prior probabilities and the complement of the error rates for the witnesses:

P(B1, B2|~A) = (1 - 0.2) * 0.7 = 0.56

P(~A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B1, B2):

P(B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.56 * 0.85)

Finally, we can find P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 / P(B1, B2)
= 0.036 / P(B1, B2)

Now, let's calculate the value of P(B1, B2) and P(A|B1, B2):

P(B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.56 * 0.85)
≈ 0.1498

P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.036 / 0.1498
≈ 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.24.

Final answer in the requested format:
