To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witnesses' accuracy. However, since the witnesses contradict each other, we cannot simply take their statements at face value. Instead, we need to weigh their statements based on their respective accuracy.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
B1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

The term P(B1, B2|A) represents the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A)

Given the accuracy of the first witness, P(B1|A) = 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller). Given the accuracy of the second witness, P(B2|A) = 0.3 (30% chance of incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm).

So, P(B1, B2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24.

The term P(B1, B2) represents the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims, regardless of the attacker's actual height. Since the witnesses contradict each other, this term is difficult to calculate directly. However, we can use the principle of total probability to express it as:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We already know P(B1, B2|A) and P(A). To find P(B1, B2|¬A), we need to consider the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(B1, B2|¬A) = P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A)

Given the accuracy of the first witness, P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller). Given the accuracy of the second witness, P(B2|¬A) = 0.7 (70% chance of correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm).

So, P(B1, B2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14.

Since P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), we can now calculate P(B1, B2):

P(B1, B2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.126 + 0.119 = 0.245

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2) ≈ 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.245 ≈ 0.143

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.143 or 14.3%.
