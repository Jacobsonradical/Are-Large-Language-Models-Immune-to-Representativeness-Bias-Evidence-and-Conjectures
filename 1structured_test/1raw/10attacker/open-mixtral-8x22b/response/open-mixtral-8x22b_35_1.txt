To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that there is an 85% chance that a person is shorter than 185 cm and a 15% chance they are 185 cm or taller.

The new evidence comes from the witnesses. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(B|~A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%.

According to Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
