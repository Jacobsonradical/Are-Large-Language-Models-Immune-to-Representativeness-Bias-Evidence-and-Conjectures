To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Our prior probability, P(A), is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

The likelihood, P(B|A), is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80% or 0.80.

The likelihood, P(B|~A), is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 20% or 0.20, since the witness errs in 20% of the cases.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substitute the given values:

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
