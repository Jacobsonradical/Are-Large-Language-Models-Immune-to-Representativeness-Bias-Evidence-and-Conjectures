To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness testimonies and their accuracy.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability based on the population distribution.

2. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%. This means that in 80% of the cases where the witness makes this claim, they are correct, and in 20% of the cases, they are incorrect.

3. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with an accuracy of 70%. This means that in 70% of the cases where the witness makes this claim, they are correct, and in 30% of the cases, they are incorrect.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula:

P(H | E1, E2) = P(E1 | H) * P(E2 | H) * P(H) / [P(E1 | H) * P(E2 | H) * P(H) + P(E1 | ~H) * P(E2 | ~H) * P(~H)]

where:
- P(H | E1, E2) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies E1 and E2.
- P(E1 | H) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(E2 | H) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(E1 | ~H) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(E2 | ~H) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.85).

Plugging in the values:

P(H | E1, E2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(H | E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.187

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.187.
