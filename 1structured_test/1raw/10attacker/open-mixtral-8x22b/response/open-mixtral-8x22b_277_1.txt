To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness testimonies and their accuracy, as well as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population.

Let's denote:
- W1 as the event of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- W2 as the event of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- A as the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

From the information given, we know:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time)
- P(W2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness identifies the correct height 70% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

Since the testimonies of both witnesses are independent, we can write:

P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A)

However, we don't have the value for P(W2|A), as the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Instead, we can use the complement rule to find P(W2|¬A):

P(W2|¬A) = 1 - P(W2|A)

Now, let's find P(W2|A):

P(W2|A) = 1 - P(W2|¬A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now we can find P(A|W1,W2):

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

Since P(W1,W2) is the probability of both witnesses' testimonies, we can use the law of total probability to find it:

P(W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1,W2|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, but we don't have the value for P(W1,W2|¬A). However, since we are looking for P(A|W1,W2), we can focus on the numerator of Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

P(A|W1,W2) ≈ (0.8) * (0.3) * (0.15) / (P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1,W2|¬A) * P(¬A))

Unfortunately, without knowing P(W1,W2|¬A), we cannot calculate the exact probability. However, we can see that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, will be lower than the first witness's accuracy (0.8) due to the second witness's contradictory claim.

Based on the available information, we can estimate that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is between 0 and 0.8, but without more information, we cannot provide a precise estimate.

{probability: 0.8, this is an upper bound estimate since we lack the information about the second witness's accuracy for cases where the person is 185 cm or taller.}
