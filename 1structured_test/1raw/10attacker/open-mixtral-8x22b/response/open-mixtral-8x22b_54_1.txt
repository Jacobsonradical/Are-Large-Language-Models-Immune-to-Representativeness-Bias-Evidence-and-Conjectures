To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is given by the general population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote:
D1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
D2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
H as the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(H|D1, D2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|D1, D2) = [P(D1|H) * P(D2|H) * P(H)] / [P(D1, D2)]

First, let's calculate P(D1|H), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8, as given in the problem.

Next, let's calculate P(D2|H), the probability that the second witness would claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 30% or 0.3, as given in the problem.

The prior probability P(H) that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15, as given in the problem.

The term P(D1, D2) is the probability that both witnesses gave their respective testimonies. This is the sum of the probabilities of the two possible scenarios:

P(D1, D2) = P(D1, D2|H) * P(H) + P(D1, D2|not H) * P(not H)

Here, P(not H) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

P(D1, D2|H) is the probability that both witnesses gave their testimonies given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is:

P(D1, D2|H) = P(D1|H) * P(D2|H) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

P(D1, D2|not H) is the probability that both witnesses gave their testimonies given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is:

P(D1, D2|not H) = P(D1|not H) * P(D2|not H) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate P(D1, D2):

P(D1, D2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.12 = 0.156

Finally, we can calculate P(H|D1, D2):

P(H|D1, D2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / 0.156 â‰ˆ 0.224

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.224.
