To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (H) given the testimony of the first witness (W1) and the second witness (W2).

First, let's define the probabilities based on the given information:

- P(H) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|H) = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|~H) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We are interested in finding P(H|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this and the second witness claimed otherwise.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1, W2)

Since the testimonies are independent, we can factor P(W1, W2|H) as:

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H)

And P(W1, W2) can be expressed as:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H)

Now we can plug in the values:

P(H|W1, W2) = (P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) \* P(H)) / (P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H))

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85))

P(H|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.144

So, based on the given information and the assumptions made, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.144.
