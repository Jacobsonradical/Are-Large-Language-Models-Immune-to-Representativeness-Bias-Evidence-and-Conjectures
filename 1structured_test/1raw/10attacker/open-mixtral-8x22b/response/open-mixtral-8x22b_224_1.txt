To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's calculate the prior probability based on the population distribution:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15
P(attacker < 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, let's consider the evidence from the witnesses:
P(W1|attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 80% = 0.8 (probability that the first witness is correct)
P(W1|attacker < 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2 (probability that the first witness is incorrect)

P(W2|attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 30% = 0.3 (probability that the second witness is correct)
P(W2|attacker < 185 cm) = 70% = 0.7 (probability that the second witness is incorrect)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(W1, W2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can multiply their probabilities:
P(W1, W2|attacker ≥ 185 cm) = P(W1|attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(W2|attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(W1, W2|attacker < 185 cm) \* P(attacker < 185 cm)

P(W1, W2|attacker < 185 cm) = P(W1|attacker < 185 cm) \* P(W2|attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, let's calculate P(W1, W2):
P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, let's calculate the posterior probability:
P(attacker ≥ 185 cm|W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 = 0.228

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from both witnesses, is approximately 0.228.
