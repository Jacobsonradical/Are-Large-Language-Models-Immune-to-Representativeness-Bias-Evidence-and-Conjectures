To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. The theorem is stated mathematically as the following equation:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that event A has occurred.
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A occurring.
- P(B) is the prior probability of event B occurring.

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller."

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

First, let's calculate P(B), the probability that the witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
     = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
       = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
