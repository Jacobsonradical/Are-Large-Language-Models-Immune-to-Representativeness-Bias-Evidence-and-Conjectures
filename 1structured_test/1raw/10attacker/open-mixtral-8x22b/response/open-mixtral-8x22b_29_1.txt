To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs in light of new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the general population height distribution, and the new evidence comes from the witness testimonies.

First, let's define our events:
- A: The event that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claims the person is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter)
- P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness mistakenly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can calculate the joint probability of both events happening:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A)
P(B1, B2|~A) = P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) * P(~A)]

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B1, B2) = [(0.8 * 0.3) * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.3) * 0.15 + (0.2 * 0.7) * 0.85]

After performing the calculations, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.289

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.289.
