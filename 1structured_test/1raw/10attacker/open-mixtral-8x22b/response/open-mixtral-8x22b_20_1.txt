To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B': The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in finding P(A|B, B'). We know the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B'|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B'|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We also know that the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the height of the attacker. Thus, we can use the following formula to find the probability:

P(A|B, B') = P(B|A) \* P(B'|A) \* P(A) / P(B, B')

P(B, B') can be expressed as:

P(B, B') = P(B|A) \* P(B'|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(B'|~A) \* P(~A)

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(B, B') = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)
P(B, B') = 0.036 + 0.119
P(B, B') = 0.155

P(A|B, B') = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / 0.155
P(A|B, B') â‰ˆ 0.23

So, given the information and the assumption of independence between the witnesses, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.23 or 23%.
