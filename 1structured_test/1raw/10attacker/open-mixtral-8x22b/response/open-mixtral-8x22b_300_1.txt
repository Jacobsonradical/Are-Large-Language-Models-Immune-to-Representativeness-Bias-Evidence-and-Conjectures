To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability based on the city's population height distribution and the likelihood that the witnesses are correct.

First, let's denote the events as follows:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- P(C|~A) = 0.7 (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

To find the posterior probability P(A|B,C), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) / P(B,C)

We can further factorize the likelihood P(B,C|A):

P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A)

Now, we can calculate P(B,C):

P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) + P(B,C|~A) \* P(~A)

Since the two witnesses' observations are independent, we can write:

P(B,C|~A) = P(B|~A) \* P(C|~A)

Now we can plug in the values and calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A)) / (P(B,C|A) \* P(A) + P(B,C|~A) \* P(~A))

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85))

P(A|B,C) â‰ˆ 0.1652

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1652, or 16.52%.
