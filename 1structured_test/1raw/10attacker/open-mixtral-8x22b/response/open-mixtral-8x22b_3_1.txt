To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the population height distribution, and the new evidence comes from the witness testimonies.

Prior probability (P(H)):
As given in the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

P(H) = 0.15

Likelihood (P(E|H)):
The likelihood is the probability of the evidence (the witness testimonies) given the height of the attacker. Since there are two witnesses, we can calculate the combined likelihood by multiplying the likelihood of each individual witness's testimony.

For the first witness:
P(E1|H) = 0.8 (Correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(E1|~H) = 0.2 (Incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

For the second witness:
P(E2|H) = 0.7 (Correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
P(E2|~H) = 0.3 (Incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

Combined likelihood:
P(E|H) = P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Combined likelihood of the opposite event (P(E|~H)):
P(E|~H) = P(E1|~H) * P(E2|~H) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Posterior probability (P(H|E)):
Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(H) * P(E|H) / [P(H) * P(E|H) + P(~H) * P(E|~H)]

P(H|E) = 0.15 * 0.56 / [0.15 * 0.56 + (1 - 0.15) * 0.06]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.71

So, based on the given information and the calculations, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.71.
