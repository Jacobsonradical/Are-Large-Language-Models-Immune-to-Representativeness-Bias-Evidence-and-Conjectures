To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). Also, we can calculate the conditional probabilities P(B1|A) and P(B2|~A) based on the information provided:

- P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% of the time).
- P(B2|~A): The probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm = 0.7 (70% of the time).

We'll use the following version of Bayes' theorem to update our probability:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Assuming the witnesses' observations are independent, we can simplify the equation:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1) * P(B2)

We don't have the values for P(B1) and P(B2), but since we're interested in the relative likelihood of A given B1 and B2, we can focus on the numerator:

P(A|B1, B2) ∝ P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)

Now, let's calculate the probability that the second witness is wrong about the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (i.e., P(B2|A)):

P(B2|A) = 1 - P(~B2|A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now we can update our probability:

P(A|B1, B2) ∝ 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.036

To get the actual probability, we would need to calculate the denominator and normalize, but since we're only interested in the relative likelihood, we can compare the result with the complement probability:

P(~A|B1, B2) ∝ P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) * P(~A)
                  = 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85
                  = 0.119

Now we can compare the relative likelihoods:

P(A|B1, B2) / (P(A|B1, B2) + P(~A|B1, B2)) = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119) ≈ 0.233

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.233. However, keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and does not take into account other factors that might influence the witnesses' observations.
