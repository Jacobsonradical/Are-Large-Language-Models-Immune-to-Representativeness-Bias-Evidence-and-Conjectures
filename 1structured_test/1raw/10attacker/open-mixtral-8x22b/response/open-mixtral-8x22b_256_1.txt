To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

The prior probability, based on information "b", is that there is a 15% chance that a random person is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's consider the evidence from the witnesses. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time and makes an error 30% of the time.

Given that the witnesses contradict each other, we can consider this as a situation of conflicting evidence. We can take the probability that the first witness is correct (80%) and the probability that the second witness is incorrect (30%).

The probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

However, we also need to consider the probability that both witnesses are incorrect. This would be 0.2 (the probability that the first witness is incorrect) * 0.7 (the probability that the second witness is correct) = 0.14.

So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is the sum of the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect, and the probability that both witnesses are incorrect: 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38.

However, this is not our final answer. We need to update our prior probability with this new evidence. So, we multiply our prior probability (0.15) by the sum of the probabilities we just calculated (0.38): 0.15 * 0.38 = 0.057.

So, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is 0.057.

Therefore, the answer, strictly in the required format, is:

{probability: 0.057}
