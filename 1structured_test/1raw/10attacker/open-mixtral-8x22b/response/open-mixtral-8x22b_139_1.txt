To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.8).
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller (0.2).
- P(C|A): The probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm (0.7).
- P(C|¬A): The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm (0.3).

We want to find P(A|B, C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can simplify this to:

P(A|B, C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

We'll use the law of total probability to find P(B, C):

P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) + P(B, C|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, this simplifies to:

P(B, C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Now we can plug in the numbers:

P(B, C) = (0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.3 \* 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135

Finally, we can find P(A|B, C):

P(A|B, C) = (0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15) / 0.135 ≈ 0.622

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.622.
