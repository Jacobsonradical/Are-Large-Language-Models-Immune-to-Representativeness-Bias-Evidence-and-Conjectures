To solve this, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.15, based on the population distribution.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
P(A) = 0.15
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(B), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter).

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.31

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387

So, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.387.
