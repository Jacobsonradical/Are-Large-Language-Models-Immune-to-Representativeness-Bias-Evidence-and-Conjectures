To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (the witness's claim).
- P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis (the probability of the witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller).
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis (the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller).
- P(E) is the probability of the evidence (the probability of the witness making that claim, regardless of the attacker's actual height).

From the information given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time).
- P(not E|not H) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time).

To find P(E), we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and that they are incorrect. If the witness is correct, the probability is P(E|H) \* P(H). If they are incorrect, the probability is (1 - P(not E|not H)) \* (1 - P(H)).

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + (1 - P(not E|not H)) \* (1 - P(H))
P(E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + (1 - 0.7) \* (1 - 0.15)
P(E) = 0.12 + 0.09
P(E) = 0.21

Now we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)
P(H|E) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.21
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.57

So, based on the information given, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.57.
