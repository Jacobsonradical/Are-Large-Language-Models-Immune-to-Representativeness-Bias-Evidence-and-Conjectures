To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses.

First, let's denote some events:
- A: The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the prior probability P(A) = 0.15, and we need to find the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2).

We can simplify this a bit by noting that B1 and B2 are independent given A, so P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A). Similarly, P(B1, B2) = P(B1) * P(B2).

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. We are given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B1|A) = 0.8.

P(B2|A): The probability that the second witness would claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The second witness is correct 70% of the time, so the probability of an error (claiming the attacker was shorter when they were not) is 30%. Therefore, P(B2|A) = 0.3.

P(B1): The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. Since half the population is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B1) = 0.5 * 0.8 + 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.5.

P(B2): The probability that the second witness would claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, regardless of the attacker's actual height. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, P(B2) = 0.85 * 0.7 + 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.645.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1) / P(B2)
= (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.5 * 0.645)
= 0.072 / 0.3225
â‰ˆ 0.223

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.223 or 22.3%.
