To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

First, let's find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed this, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
