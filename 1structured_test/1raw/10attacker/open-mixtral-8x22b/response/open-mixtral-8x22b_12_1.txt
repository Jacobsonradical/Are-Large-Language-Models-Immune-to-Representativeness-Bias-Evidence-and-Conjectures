To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. The prior probability (based on the population distribution) is 0.15 (15%). We have two witnesses, each providing a piece of evidence. We'll calculate the posterior probability after considering each witness's testimony.

For the first witness:
- The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%).
- The probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (20%).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H), and the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(E1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) / P(E1)

We know P(E1|H) is 0.8, and P(H) is 0.15. The term P(E1) is the total probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of the probability that the witness is correct and the probability that the witness is incorrect.

P(E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) + P(E1|~H) * P(~H)

We know P(E1|~H) is 0.2 and P(~H) is 0.85 (since the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%).

So, P(E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.325

Then, P(H|E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.325 ≈ 0.3692

Now, let's consider the second witness's testimony. The probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm is 0.7 (70%).

Let's denote the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as P(E2).

Using Bayes' theorem again:

P(~H|E2) = P(E2|~H) * P(~H) / P(E2)

We know P(E2|~H) is 0.7, and P(~H) is 0.85. The term P(E2) is the total probability of the second witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(E2) = P(E2|~H) * P(~H) + P(E2|H) * P(H)

Since P(E2|H) is the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller, it is 0.3 (30%).

So, P(E2) = 0.7 * 0.85 + 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.645

Then, P(~H|E2) = 0.7 * 0.85 / 0.645 ≈ 0.9519

Since the probabilities must sum up to 1, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both pieces of evidence, is:

P(H|E1, E2) = 1 - P(~H|E2) ≈ 1 - 0.9519 = 0.0481

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.0481.
