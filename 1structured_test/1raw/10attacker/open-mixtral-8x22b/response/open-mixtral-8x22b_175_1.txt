To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayesian approach to update our prior probability based on the witness testimonies.

First, our prior probability is based on the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, without any witness testimonies, we would assume a 15% probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Next, we have two witnesses, each with their own accuracy rates. To update our prior probability, we can use the following formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
B is the witness testimony.
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85).
P(B|A) is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (i.e., the witness's accuracy rate).
P(B|~A) is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (i.e., the witness's error rate).

We can calculate the updated probability for each witness separately and then combine them using the formula for the probability of independent events.

For the first witness:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.328

For the second witness:
P(A|B) = 0.7 * 0.15 / [0.7 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85] = 0.255

Since the two witnesses are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get the combined probability:
P(A|B1, B2) = P(A|B1) * P(A|B2) = 0.328 * 0.255 = 0.084

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.084 or 8.4%.
