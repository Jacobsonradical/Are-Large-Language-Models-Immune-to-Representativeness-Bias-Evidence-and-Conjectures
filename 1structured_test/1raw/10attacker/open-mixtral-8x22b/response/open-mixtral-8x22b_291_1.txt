To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider the possibility that the attacker is taller and the witness is correct, and the possibility that the attacker is shorter and the witness is incorrect. Since half of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time, we can estimate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.30 * 0.50
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.15
P(B) = 0.27

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.27
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.44

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.44 or 44%.
