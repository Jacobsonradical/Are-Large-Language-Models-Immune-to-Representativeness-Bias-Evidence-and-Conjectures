To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, based on the population statistics (85% are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate the probability of A given both witnesses' claims (B1 and B2) using the following formula based on Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1,B2) = P(B1,B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1,B2)

We can simplify this by noting that the claims of the two witnesses are conditionally independent given A (i.e., the first witness's claim does not affect the second witness's claim, assuming the attacker's height is known). Therefore, we have:

P(B1,B2|A) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A)

Now, let's calculate these probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)

P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

P(B2|not A) = 0.70 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

Since the two witnesses' claims are contradictory, we need to consider the probability that the second witness is incorrect when they claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the complement of P(B2|not A):

P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B2|not A) = 0.30

Finally, we need to calculate P(B1,B2), which is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims. Since their claims are contradictory, we can consider the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(B1,B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|not A) \* P(B2|not A) \* P(not A)

We already have P(B1|A), P(B2|A), and P(A), and we can calculate P(B1|not A) and P(B2|not A) using the given information:

P(B1|not A) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.20
P(B2|not A) = 0.70 (as previously mentioned)

Now, we can calculate P(B1,B2):

P(B1,B2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)

After performing the calculations:

P(B1,B2) ≈ 0.1015

Now, we can find P(A|B1,B2):

P(A|B1,B2) = (P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A)) / P(B1,B2)
P(A|B1,B2) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / 0.1015

After performing the calculations:

P(A|B1,B2) ≈ 0.354

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.354.
