To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We know this is 80%, or 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller. We know this is 15%, or 0.15.

P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this by considering the two possible scenarios for the attacker's height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

P(~A) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%, or 0.85.

P(B|~A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know this is 20%, or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
