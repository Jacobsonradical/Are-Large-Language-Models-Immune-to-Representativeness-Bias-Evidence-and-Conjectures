To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
- P(B1|not A) = 0.20 (The first witness made an error 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A) = 0.30 (The second witness made an error 30% of the time)
- P(B2|not A) = 0.70 (The second witness correctly identified the height 70% of the time)

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were (and the second witness claimed they weren't) is:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) / [P(B1, B2|A)P(A) + P(B1, B2|not A)P(not A)]

To calculate P(B1, B2|A) and P(B1, B2|not A), we need to consider the probability that both witnesses made the claims they did given the true height of the attacker. Since the witnesses' claims are independent, we can multiply their individual probabilities:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A)P(B2|A) = (0.80)(0.30)
P(B1, B2|not A) = P(B1|not A)P(B2|not A) = (0.20)(0.70)

Now we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = [(0.80)(0.30)(0.15)] / [(0.80)(0.30)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.70)(0.85)]

After calculating the above expression, we find:

P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.226

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.226.
