To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability and the witness testimonies. The prior probability, based on the population distribution, is that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Next, we'll use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability with the witness testimonies. We have two witnesses, but since they contradict each other, we'll analyze both testimonies separately and then combine them.

First witness:
- Prior probability: P(H) = 0.15 (probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- Likelihood: P(E|H) = 0.80 (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
- Likelihood: P(E|not H) = 0.20 (probability that the witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm)
- Posterior probability: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H)]

Plugging in the values:
- P(H|E) = 0.80 * 0.15 / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * (1 - 0.15)]
- P(H|E) ≈ 0.3077 (probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony)

Second witness:
- Prior probability: P(H) = 0.15 (same as before)
- Likelihood: P(E|H) = 0.30 (probability that the witness identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm given that they are actually 185 cm or taller)
- Likelihood: P(E|not H) = 0.70 (probability that the witness identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm given that they are indeed shorter than 185 cm)
- Posterior probability: P(not H|E) = P(E|not H) * P(not H) / [P(E|not H) * P(not H) + P(E|H) * P(H)]

Plugging in the values:
- P(not H|E) = 0.70 * (1 - 0.15) / [0.70 * (1 - 0.15) + 0.30 * 0.15]
- P(not H|E) ≈ 0.7500 (probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given the second witness's testimony)

Now, to combine both testimonies, we can use the principle of conjunctive probability (assuming independence between the witnesses):

P(H) = P(H|E1) * P(H|E2)
P(H) ≈ 0.3077 * (1 - 0.7500)
P(H) ≈ 0.0769 (probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on both witnesses' testimonies)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.0769.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.0769}
