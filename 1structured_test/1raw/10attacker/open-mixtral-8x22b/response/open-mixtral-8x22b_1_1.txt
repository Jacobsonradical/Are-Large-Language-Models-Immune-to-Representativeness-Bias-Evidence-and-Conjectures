To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Our prior probability, based on the distribution of heights in the city (information b), is that there is a 15% chance that a random person is 185 cm or taller.

The new evidence we have is the testimonies of two witnesses. Unfortunately, their testimonies contradict each other. However, we can still use the accuracy rates of the witnesses to update our probability.

Let's denote:
- Event A as "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B as "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event C as "the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"

We are interested in P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

We have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|~A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

However, we have a problem: the testimonies contradict each other, and we don't have enough information to decide which witness is more reliable in this particular case.

One possible approach is to ignore the second witness and just use the testimony of the first witness. This is a simplification, but it's the best we can do with the available information.

So, we have:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

Substituting the values we have:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.357

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based solely on the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.357.

This estimate is lower than the prior probability (0.15), which is not surprising given that the second witness contradicts the first one. If we had more information about the reliability of the witnesses in this particular case, we could make a more accurate estimate.
