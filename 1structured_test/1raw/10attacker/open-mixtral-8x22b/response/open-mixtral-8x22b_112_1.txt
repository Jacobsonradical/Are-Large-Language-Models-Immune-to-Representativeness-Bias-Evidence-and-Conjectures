To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).

Let's denote:
- H as the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- E1 as the evidence that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- E2 as the evidence that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given the height of the attacker. Let's denote:
- P(E1|H) as the probability that the first witness would correctly claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- P(E1|¬H) as the probability that the first witness would incorrectly claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- P(E2|H) as the probability that the second witness would incorrectly claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm
- P(E2|¬H) as the probability that the second witness would correctly claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we have:
- P(E1|H) = 0.8, the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time
- P(E1|¬H) = 0.2, the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time
- P(E2|H) = 0.3, the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time
- P(E2|¬H) = 0.7, the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability P(H|E1, E2) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

We can expand P(E1, E2|H) using the law of total probability:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)

Similarly, we can expand P(E1, E2):

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Since we're only interested in the relative probabilities, we can ignore the denominator P(E1, E2) as it is constant for both hypotheses. Thus, we only need to calculate the numerator:

P(H|E1, E2) ∝ P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H)

P(¬H|E1, E2) ∝ P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(H|E1, E2) ∝ 0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 = 0.036
P(¬H|E1, E2) ∝ 0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.119

To get the actual probabilities, we need to normalize the values:

P(H|E1, E2) = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119) ≈ 0.232
P(¬H|E1, E2) = 0.119 / (0.036 + 0.119) ≈ 0.768

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
