To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem and the information provided.

Let's denote:
A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: the event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of people are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and the case where they are shorter. So we have:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of people are shorter than 185 cm), and the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B|not A) = 0.2

So:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
