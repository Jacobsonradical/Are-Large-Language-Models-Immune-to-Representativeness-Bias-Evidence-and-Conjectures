To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the population distribution, and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
- H: the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- ~H: the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm
- E1: the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- E2: the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We have the following probabilities from the given information:
- P(H) = 0.15 (The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(E1|H) = 0.80 (The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(E1|~H) = 0.20 (The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(E2|H) = 0.30 (The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)
- P(E2|~H) = 0.70 (The probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) / P(E1, E2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent of each other, we can simplify the likelihood P(E1, E2|H) as the product of the individual likelihoods:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) * P(H) / P(E1, E2)

Now, we need to find P(E1, E2), which is the probability of both witness testimonies occurring. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) * P(~H)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can write this as:
P(E1, E2) = P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) * P(H) + P(E1|~H) * P(E2|~H) * P(~H)

Now, we can plug in the given probabilities:
P(H|E1, E2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)]

Calculating the value:
P(H|E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.36.
