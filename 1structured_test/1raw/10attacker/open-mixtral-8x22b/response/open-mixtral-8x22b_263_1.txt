To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller (15%).

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A and the event that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W. We are interested in finding P(A|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{P(W|A)P(A)}{P(W)} \]

We know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(W) = P(W|A)P(A) + P(W|not A)P(not A) \]

We know:
- P(not A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W):
\[ P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.23 \]

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
\[ P(A|W) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.23} \approx 0.52 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.52.
