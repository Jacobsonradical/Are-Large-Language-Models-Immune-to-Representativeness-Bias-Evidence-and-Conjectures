To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population and the reliability of the witnesses.

The base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Now, let's consider the witnesses' testimonies. The first witness was correct about height 80% of the time, and the second witness was correct 70% of the time. Given that they had conflicting testimonies, we might consider their testimonies as "votes" towards the height being 185 cm or taller (first witness) or shorter than 185 cm (second witness).

To combine their testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem, but a simplified approach would be to weigh their testimonies based on their reliability. The first witness has a higher reliability, so we might give their testimony more weight.

A simple way to combine their testimonies would be to take a weighted average of their reliabilities:

Weighted average = (Reliability of first witness * Testimony of first witness) + (Reliability of second witness * Testimony of second witness)

This results in:

Weighted average = (0.80 * 1) + (0.70 * 0) = 0.80

However, this approach assumes that the testimonies are independent, which might not be the case if the witnesses influenced each other.

A more nuanced approach would be to use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (the base rate) with the testimonies of the witnesses. However, without more information about the witnesses' independence and the distributions of their errors, it's challenging to apply Bayes' theorem accurately.

Given these considerations, and taking a conservative approach, we might estimate the probability to be somewhere between the base rate (15%) and the first witness's reliability (80%).

A reasonable estimate might be around 50%, considering the conflicting testimonies and the base rate.
