To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we'll use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41379

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41379 or 41.38%.
