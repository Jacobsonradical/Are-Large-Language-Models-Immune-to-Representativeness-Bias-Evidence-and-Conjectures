To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- C: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(A^c): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|A^c): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(C|A): The probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 30% or 0.3.
- P(C|A^c): The probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

We need to find P(A|B, C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) / P(B, C)

P(B, C|A) is the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B, C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

P(B, C) is the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims, regardless of the attacker's height. This can be calculated as:

P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) + P(B, C|A^c) * P(A^c)

P(B, C|A^c) is the probability that both witnesses made their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as:

P(B, C|A^c) = P(B|A^c) * P(C|A^c) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(B, C):

P(B, C) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.12 = 0.156

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B, C):

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) / P(B, C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.156 â‰ˆ 0.2308

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2308.
