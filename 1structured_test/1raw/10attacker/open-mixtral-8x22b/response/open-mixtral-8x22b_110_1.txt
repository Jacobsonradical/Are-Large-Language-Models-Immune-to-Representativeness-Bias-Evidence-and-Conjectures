To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the Bayesian theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:
A: The event that a randomly selected individual from the population is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Our prior probability P(A) is the base rate of individuals who are 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 15% or 0.15.

The likelihood P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

The likelihood P(B|¬A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The first witness makes an error 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Here, P(¬A) is the probability that a randomly selected individual from the population is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.4615}
