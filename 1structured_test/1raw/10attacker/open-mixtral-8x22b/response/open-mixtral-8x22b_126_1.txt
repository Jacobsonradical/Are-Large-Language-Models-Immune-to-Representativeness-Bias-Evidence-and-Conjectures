To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- Event B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We already know the following probabilities:

- P(A): Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- P(not A): Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85
- P(B|A): Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
- P(B|not A): Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2

Now, we want to find P(A|B): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the known values:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this gives:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.43.
