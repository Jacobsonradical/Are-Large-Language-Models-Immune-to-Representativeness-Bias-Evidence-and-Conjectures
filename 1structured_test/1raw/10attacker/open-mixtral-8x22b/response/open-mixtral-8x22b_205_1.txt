To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know that:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the first witness being correct and incorrect:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know that:

- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

So,

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.31

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.31 â‰ˆ 0.387097

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.387097 or 38.71%.
