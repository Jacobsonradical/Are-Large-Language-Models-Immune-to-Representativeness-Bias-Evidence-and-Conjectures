To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Event C: The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information, we have:

- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are shorter)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they are 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
