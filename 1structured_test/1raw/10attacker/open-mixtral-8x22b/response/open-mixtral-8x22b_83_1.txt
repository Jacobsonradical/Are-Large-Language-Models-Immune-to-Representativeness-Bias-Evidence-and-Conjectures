To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that the first witness claimed so (W1).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1), where:

- P(A|W1) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.
- P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know that:
- P(W1|A) is the accuracy of the first witness's height assessment, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- However, we don't know P(W1), the overall probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To find this, we also need to consider the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (W1|~A), which is the error rate of the first witness, 20% or 0.2.

Let P(~A) be the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85. Then, P(W1|~A) is the error rate of the first witness, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(W1) as the weighted average of P(W1|A) and P(W1|~A) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(~A)

Substituting the given values:

P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
