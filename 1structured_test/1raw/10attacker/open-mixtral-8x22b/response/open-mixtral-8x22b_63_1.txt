To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2 as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are interested in finding P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies. We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Now, let's compute each of these probabilities:

1. P(A): The prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 15%, as given in information b.
2. P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 80%, as given in information a.
3. P(B2|~A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 70%, as given in information a.
4. P(B1, B2|A): The probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|~A) = 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56

5. P(B1, B2): The probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies is the sum of the probabilities of both events happening together:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) \* P(~A)

Since the second witness's testimony is about the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the error rate of the second witness). Now we can calculate P(B1, B2|~A) and P(B1, B2):

P(B1, B2|~A) = P(B1|~A) \* P(B2|~A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A) \* P(~A) = 0.56 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.187

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2) ≈ 0.56 \* 0.15 / 0.187 ≈ 0.454

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.454.
