To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B.

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that they are)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that they are not)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

P(~A) is the probability that a random person is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.345.

Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.345 = 0.3478.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3478.
