To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

The prior probability (P(H)) is the general probability of an individual being 185 cm or taller in the city's population, which is 15%.

The likelihood of the first witness being correct given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(E1|H)) is 80%, and the likelihood of the second witness being correct given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (P(E2|~H)) is 70%.

We can assume that the observations of the two witnesses are independent events. Therefore, the joint likelihood of both witnesses being correct given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) * P(E2|H). Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, P(E2|H) = 1 - P(E2|~H) = 1 - 70% = 30%. Therefore, P(E1, E2|H) = 80% * 30% = 24%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(H) * P(E1, E2|H)] / [P(H) * P(E1, E2|H) + P(~H) * P(E1, E2|~H)]

The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (P(~H)) is 85%, and the joint likelihood of both witnesses being correct given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is P(E1, E2|~H) = P(E1|~H) * P(E2|~H). Since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, P(E1|~H) = 1 - P(E1|H) = 1 - 80% = 20%. Therefore, P(E1, E2|~H) = 20% * 70% = 14%.

Now we can calculate P(H|E1, E2):

P(H|E1, E2) = [0.15 * 0.24] / [0.15 * 0.24 + 0.85 * 0.14]

P(H|E1, E2) ≈ 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119) ≈ 0.233

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.233, or 23.3%.
