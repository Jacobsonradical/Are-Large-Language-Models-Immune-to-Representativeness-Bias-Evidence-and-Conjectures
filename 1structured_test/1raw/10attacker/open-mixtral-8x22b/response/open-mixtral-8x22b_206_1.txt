To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates as we gather new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A), given the testimonies of both witnesses (evidence B1 and B2).

Let's start with the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15, based on the city's population statistics (event B).

Now, let's consider the testimonies of the witnesses. The first witness has an accuracy of 80% (0.8) in identifying the correct height, while the second witness has an accuracy of 70% (0.7). We can denote the accuracy of the first witness's testimony as P(B1|A) and the accuracy of the second witness's testimony as P(B2|A'). Here, A' represents the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses, as:

P(A|B1,B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A') \* P(A) / [P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A') \* P(A) + P(B1|A') \* P(B2|A) \* P(A')]

We know that P(B1|A') = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.2, and P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B2|A') = 0.3. Also, P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(A|B1,B2) = 0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.3 \* 0.85)

Simplifying this expression, we find:

P(A|B1,B2) = 0.54 / (0.54 + 0.051) = 0.913

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimonies of both witnesses, is approximately 0.913 or 91.3%.

Answer: {probability: 0.913}
