To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the population distribution of heights (85% shorter, 15% 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We have two pieces of evidence from the witnesses (B1 and B2), so we will calculate the posterior probability given each piece of evidence and then combine them.

First, let's calculate the posterior probability using the first witness's testimony (B1):

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / P(B1)

We know that P(B1|A) is the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. P(B1) is the overall probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. To calculate P(B1), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the case where they are shorter, weighted by the prior probabilities:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)

Since P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85%, and P(B1|not A) is the probability that the first witness makes an error when the attacker is shorter, which is 20%:

P(B1) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.27

Now we can calculate P(A|B1):

P(A|B1) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.27 ≈ 0.444

Next, let's calculate the posterior probability using the second witness's testimony (B2):

P(A|B2) = P(B2|A) * P(A) / P(B2)

We know that P(B2|A) is the probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 30% (the error rate). P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. P(B2) is the overall probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, regardless of the actual height. To calculate P(B2), we need to consider both the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the case where they are shorter, weighted by the prior probabilities:

P(B2) = P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B2|not A) * P(not A)

Since P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85%, and P(B2|not A) is the accuracy of the second witness when the attacker is shorter, which is 70%:

P(B2) = 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.70 * 0.85 = 0.645

Now we can calculate P(A|B2):

P(A|B2) = 0.30 * 0.15 / 0.645 ≈ 0.071

Finally, to combine the evidence from both witnesses, we can take a weighted average of the posterior probabilities, with weights proportional to the reliability of each witness:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)) / (P(B1) + P(B2))

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.444 * 0.27 + 0.071 * 0.645) / (0.27 + 0.645) ≈ 0.157

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 0.157.
