To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probabilities with new evidence.

First, let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population distribution.
P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 based on the witness's ability to judge height.
P(B|~A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 based on the witness's error rate.
P(C|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30 based on the second witness's error rate.
P(C|~A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70 based on the second witness's ability to judge height.

We want to find P(A|B, C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B, C) as follows:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

However, calculating P(B, C) directly would require us to consider all possible combinations of events A and ~A, which can be complex. Instead, we can use the law of total probability and the fact that events B and C are conditionally independent given A to simplify the calculation:

P(A|B, C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(C|~A) \* P(~A))

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(A|B, C) = (0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.30 \* 0.85))

Calculating the values:

P(A|B, C) = (0.084) / (0.084 + 0.051)

P(A|B, C) = 0.622

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the evidence from both witnesses, is approximately 0.622.
