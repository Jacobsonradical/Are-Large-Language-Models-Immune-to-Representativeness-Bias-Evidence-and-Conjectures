To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge or evidence related to that event.

First, let's denote the following events:

- A: The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (P(A|B)) can be calculated using the following formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

The probability that the first witness is correct in identifying a person as 185 cm or taller (P(B|A)) is 0.80, based on the given information. The probability that any given individual in the city is 185 cm or taller (P(A)) is 0.15.

Now, we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by considering both the cases when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(B|A) is 0.80, and P(A) is 0.15. P(not A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85. P(B|not A), the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided by the first witness is approximately 0.4138.
