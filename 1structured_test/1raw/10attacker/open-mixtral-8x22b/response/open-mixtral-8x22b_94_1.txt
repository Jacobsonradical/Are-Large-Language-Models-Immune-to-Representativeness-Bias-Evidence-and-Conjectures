To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2 as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A | B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

First, we'll find the prior probability:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from the information about the city's population height distribution)

Next, we'll find the likelihood probabilities, which are the probabilities of the witnesses' claims given the attacker's height:

P(B1 | A) = 80% = 0.8 (from the first witness's accuracy)
P(B1 | ~A) = 20% = 0.2 (from the first witness's error rate)
P(B2 | A) = 30% = 0.3 (from the second witness's error rate)
P(B2 | ~A) = 70% = 0.7 (from the second witness's accuracy)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability:

P(A | B1, B2) = P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A) / [P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ~A) * P(B2 | ~A) * P(~A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]

P(A | B1, B2) = (0.036) / [(0.036) + (0.119)]

P(A | B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.233

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.233 or 23.3%.
