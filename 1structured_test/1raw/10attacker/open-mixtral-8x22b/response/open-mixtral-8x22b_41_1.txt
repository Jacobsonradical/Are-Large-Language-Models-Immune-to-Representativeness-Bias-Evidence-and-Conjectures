To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the distribution of heights in the population, and the new evidence is the testimony of the witnesses.

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. Let's denote P(B|A) as the probability that the first witness would correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8. Let's denote P(B|~A) as the probability that the first witness would incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller, given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 20% or 0.2.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where P(A|B) is the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so, and P(B) is the total probability that the first witness says that a person is 185 cm or taller.

P(B) can be calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where P(~A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.215

And:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.215 â‰ˆ 0.558

So, given the first witness's testimony and their accuracy, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.558.

However, we also have the testimony of the second witness, who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We can update our estimate again using this testimony. Let's denote P(C) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7. Let's denote P(C|~A) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, given that the person is indeed shorter than 185 cm, which is also 70% or 0.7. Let's denote P(C|A) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 30% or 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we get:

P(~A|C) = P(C|~A) * P(~A) / P(C) = 0.7 * 0.85 / 0.77 = 0.82

So, given the second witness's testimony and their accuracy, the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.82.

Since these two testimonies are independent, we can multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability that both testimonies are correct. However, since we are interested in the probability that the first witness is correct, we should take the probability that both are correct and divide it by the probability that the second witness is correct.

The probability that both witnesses are correct is approximately 0.558 * 0.82 = 0.458. The probability that the second witness is correct is 0.82. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct, given that both testimonies are considered, is approximately 0.458 / 0.82 = 0.559.

So, our final estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses, is approximately 0.559.
