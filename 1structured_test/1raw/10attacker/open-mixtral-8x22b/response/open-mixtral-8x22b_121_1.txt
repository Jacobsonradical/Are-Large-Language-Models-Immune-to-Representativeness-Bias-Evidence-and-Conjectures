To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%), and the witnesses' testimonies, we want to find the posterior probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let A be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witness, respectively, claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B1, B2).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2)

P(B1, B2|A) is the probability that both witnesses claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. Since both witnesses' testimonies are independent:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A)

Now, let's calculate P(B1|A) and P(B2|A):

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(B2|A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Now, let's calculate P(B1, B2), which is the probability that both witnesses claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) * P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller), and assuming that both witnesses are equally likely to make mistakes:

P(B1, B2|¬A) = P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, we can calculate P(B1, B2):

P(B1, B2) = 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1, B2) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.135 = 0.652

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.652 (65.2%).
