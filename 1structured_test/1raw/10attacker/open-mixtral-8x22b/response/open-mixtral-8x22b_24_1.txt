To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability (a) and the witness testimonies (b).

The prior probability (a) states that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our starting point.

Now, considering the witness testimonies (b), we have two witnesses with different accuracy rates for identifying height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can update our probability estimate using Bayes' theorem. However, since we don't have information about the attacker's height from other sources, we'll treat the witness testimonies as independent observations.

First, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness 1 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability that the second witness is incorrect given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(Witness 2 incorrect | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.3

Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, this is the complement of what we need. So, the probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(Witness 2 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

Now, we can combine these probabilities with the prior probability to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness 1, Witness 2) = [P(Witness 1 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Witness 2 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / [P(Witness 1 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Witness 2 correct | attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(Witness 1 incorrect | attacker < 185 cm) * P(Witness 2 correct | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm)]

We know P(Witness 1 incorrect | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 and P(Witness 2 correct | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.7. Plugging in the values:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | Witness 1, Witness 2) = [0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85] ≈ 0.389

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.389.
