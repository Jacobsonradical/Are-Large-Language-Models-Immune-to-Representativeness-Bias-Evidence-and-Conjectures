To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Our prior probability (P(H)) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

The new evidence comes from the witnesses. Let's denote the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as E1 and the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as E2.

The probability of the first witness being correct when they claim someone is 185 cm or taller (P(E1|H)) is 80% or 0.8, and the probability of the first witness being incorrect when they claim someone is 185 cm or taller (P(E1|~H)) is 20% or 0.2.

The probability of the second witness being correct when they claim someone is shorter than 185 cm (P(E2|~H)) is 70% or 0.7, and the probability of the second witness being incorrect when they claim someone is shorter than 185 cm (P(E2|H)) is 30% or 0.3.

Bayes' theorem tells us that P(H|E1, E2) = P(H) * P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) / P(E1, E2).

We can calculate P(E1, E2) as the sum of the probabilities of all the ways E1 and E2 can occur: P(E1, E2) = P(H) * P(E1|H) * P(E2|H) + P(~H) * P(E1|~H) * P(E2|~H).

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(H|E1, E2) = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 / (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 + 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.7) = 0.126 / (0.126 + 0.119) = 0.515 or 51.5%.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 51.5%.
