To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:

- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Now we know:

- P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|~A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

So,

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41379

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed this, is approximately 0.41379. However, this is a simplification, as we are not considering the second witness's claim and other possible factors.

In the requested format:
