To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of events.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

From the given information, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller)

We also need P(B), the overall probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Plugging in the values:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
