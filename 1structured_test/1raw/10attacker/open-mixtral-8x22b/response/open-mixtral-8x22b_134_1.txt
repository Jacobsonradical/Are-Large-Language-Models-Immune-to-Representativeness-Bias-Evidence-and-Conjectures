To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness testimony.

Let's denote the following:
- A: The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.80.
- P(B1|¬A): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - 0.80 = 0.20.
- P(B2|A): The probability that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.70 = 0.30.
- P(B2|¬A): The probability that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.70.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

We can simplify the calculation by considering only the likelihood ratio:

P(A|B1, B2) / P(¬A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B1, B2|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Using the law of total probability, we can express P(B1, B2) as:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Now, we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = [P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

LR = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)

LR ≈ 0.304

Now, we can find the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = LR / (1 + LR)

P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.304 / (1 + 0.304)

P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.233

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.233 or 23.3%.

Answer: {probability: 0.233}
