To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- E1: Event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- E2: Event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- A: Event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(E1|A): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.8).
- P(E1|~A): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2).
- P(E2|A): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.3).
- P(E2|~A): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.7).

We are interested in the posterior probability P(A|E1, E2), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|E1, E2) = [P(E1|A) * P(E2|A) * P(A)] / [P(E1|A) * P(E2|A) * P(A) + P(E1|~A) * P(E2|~A) * P(~A)]

Now, plug in the given probabilities:

P(A|E1, E2) = [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]

After calculating the above expression, we get an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as:
