To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Given the information, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A))

First, calculate the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, substitute the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

Numerator: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
Denominator: (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator to find the probability:

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
