To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

In this case, our prior belief will be based on the population statistics given in (a):
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15
P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, let's consider the new evidence from (b), which consists of two witness testimonies.

The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and makes mistakes 20% of the time. So, the probability of the witness saying the attacker was ≥ 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed ≥ 185 cm is:
P(W1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8
And the probability of the witness saying the attacker was ≥ 185 cm given that the attacker is actually < 185 cm is:
P(W1 | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2

Similarly for the second witness:
P(W2 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.7
P(W2 | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.3

Since both witnesses provided conflicting testimonies, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. To do this, we'll use Bayes' theorem for the first witness's claim:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1) = [P(W1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)] / P(W1)

We'll assume that the testimonies of the two witnesses are independent of each other, so we can ignore the second witness for now.

P(W1) = P(W1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(W1 | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

Now, we can plug in the values we have:

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.31

Now, we can find P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1):

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.31 ≈ 0.387

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.387 or 38.7%.
