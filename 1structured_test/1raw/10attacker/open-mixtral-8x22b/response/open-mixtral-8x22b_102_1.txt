To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability, which is 15% (from information "a"), and the testimonies of the two witnesses (from information "b").

The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and makes an error 30% of the time.

To calculate the posterior probability, we need to consider both testimonies and their accuracy. However, since the testimonies contradict each other, we cannot simply combine their accuracy rates. Instead, we should consider the possibility that each witness made an error.

If the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is wrong is:

P(first correct, second wrong) = P(first correct) * P(second wrong) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

If the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the first witness is wrong and the second witness is correct is:

P(first wrong, second correct) = P(first wrong) * P(second correct) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we need to consider the prior probabilities as well. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies:

P(attacker is tall | testimonies) = [P(first correct, second wrong) * P(attacker is tall)] / [P(first correct, second wrong) * P(attacker is tall) + P(first wrong, second correct) * P(attacker is short)]

Substituting the values we have:

P(attacker is tall | testimonies) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85)

P(attacker is tall | testimonies) â‰ˆ 0.223

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.223 (or 22.3%).
