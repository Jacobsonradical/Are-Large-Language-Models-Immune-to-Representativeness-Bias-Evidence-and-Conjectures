To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A as "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- Event B as "the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller"
- Event C as "the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm"
- P(A) as the prior probability of A, which is 0.15 based on the given information
- P(B|A) as the probability of B given A, which is 0.80 based on the first witness's accuracy
- P(C|~A) as the probability of C given not A, which is 0.70 based on the second witness's accuracy

We want to find P(A|B, C), the probability of A given both B and C. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

Since B and C are conditionally independent given A, we can simplify this to:

P(A|B, C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

However, we don't have the value for P(C|A), the probability of C given A. Instead, we can use the law of total probability to express P(B, C) in terms of P(B|A), P(~A), P(C|~A), and P(~A|B, C):

P(B, C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(C|~A) \* P(~A)

We know that P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, P(B|~A) = 0.20 (the first witness's error rate), and P(C|~A) = 0.70. However, since we don't have P(C|A), we'll ignore this term for now and focus on the ratio of P(B|A) \* P(A) to P(B|~A) \* P(~A):

P(A|B, C) ∝ P(B|A) \* P(A) / (P(B|~A) \* P(~A))

P(A|B, C) ∝ (0.80 \* 0.15) / (0.20 \* 0.85)

P(A|B, C) ∝ 0.12 / 0.17

P(A|B, C) ≈ 0.71

This is a rough estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim and the second witness's contradictory claim. The actual probability would depend on the value of P(C|A), which is not provided. However, this calculation suggests that the first witness's claim is more likely to be correct than not, based on their respective accuracies and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.
