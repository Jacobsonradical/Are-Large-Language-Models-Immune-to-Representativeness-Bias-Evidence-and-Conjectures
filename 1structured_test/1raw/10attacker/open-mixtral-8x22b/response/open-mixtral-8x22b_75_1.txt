To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

First, let's denote some events:
A = attacker is 185 cm or taller
B1 = first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
B2 = second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem, we know the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (80% chance the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (20% chance the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(B2|A) = 0.3 (30% chance the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (70% chance the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) / P(B1, B2)

We can simplify the numerator using the conditional independence of B1 and B2 given A:
P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A)P(B2|A)

We can find P(B1, B2) using the law of total probability:
P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A)P(~A)

Since B1 and B2 are not conditionally independent given ~A, we cannot factor P(B1, B2|~A) as P(B1|~A)P(B2|~A). Instead, we'll calculate it directly:
P(B1, B2|~A) = P(B1|~A)P(B2|B1, ~A)

Now we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1|A)P(B2|A)P(A)] / [P(B1, B2|A)P(A) + P(B1, B2|~A)P(~A)]

Substitute the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * P(B2|B1, ~A) * 0.85]

To find P(B2|B1, ~A), we again use Bayes' theorem:
P(B2|B1, ~A) = P(B1|B2, ~A)P(B2|~A) / P(B1|~A)

Since we don't have P(B1|B2, ~A), we can't calculate this directly. However, we can use the given probabilities to find a lower bound for P(A|B1, B2) by assuming P(B1|B2, ~A) = 0 (which is not true, but provides a lower bound):

P(A|B1, B2) >= [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0 * 0.85] = 0.514

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is at least 0.514.

{probability: 0.514, but this is a lower bound and the actual probability could be higher}
