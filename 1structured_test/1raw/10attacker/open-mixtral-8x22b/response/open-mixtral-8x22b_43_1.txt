To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is based on the general population statistics (85% are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller).

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B': the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

First, let's calculate the prior probability P(A) based on the population statistics:
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's determine the likelihood P(B|A) and P(B'|A) based on the witnesses' accuracy:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B'|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|B, B'):
P(A|B, B') = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(B'|A) / [P(A) * P(B|A) * P(B'|A) + P(¬A) * P(B|¬A) * P(B'|¬A)]

P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(B'|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B, B') = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 / [0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 + 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.7]

P(A|B, B') ≈ 0.20 (or 20%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 20%.
