To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- W1: The event that the first witness is correct about the attacker's height
- W2: The event that the second witness is correct about the attacker's height
- H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this to be the case. According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) / P(W1)

We know that P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the accuracy of the first witness when the height is 185 cm or taller), P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we can find P(W1) as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) + P(W1|~H)P(~H)

Here, P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) and P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness).

Substituting these values we get:

P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.22

Now, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.545

Given this analysis, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.545.
