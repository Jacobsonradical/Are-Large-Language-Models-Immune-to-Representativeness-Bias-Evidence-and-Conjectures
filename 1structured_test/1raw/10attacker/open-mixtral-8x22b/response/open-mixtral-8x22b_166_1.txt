To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. We have two pieces of evidence: the testimonies of the two witnesses. We can calculate the posterior probability given the prior probability and the likelihood of the evidence.

First, let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness's claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- C: The second witness's claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:

Prior probability:
- P(A): The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- P(not A): The probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Likelihood of the evidence:
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
- P(B|not A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2.
- P(C|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.3.
- P(C|not A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

We don't have the joint probability P(B, C|A), so we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(B, C):

P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) + P(B, C|not A) \* P(not A)

To find P(B, C|A) and P(B, C|not A), we can use the independence of the two witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height:

P(B, C|A) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(B, C|not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(C|not A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate P(B, C):

P(B, C) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B, C):

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.2252

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2252.
