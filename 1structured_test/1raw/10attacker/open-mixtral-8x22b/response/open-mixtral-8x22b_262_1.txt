To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the likelihood of B given A times the prior probability of A, divided by the prior probability of B. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (A) given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller (B).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of A, which is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of B given A, which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the given information, the first witness correctly identifies the height about 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.80.

Now, let's calculate the prior probability of B, which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of the actual height. Since half of the population is 185 cm or taller and half is shorter, and the first witness is equally likely to make a correct or incorrect identification, the probability of B occurring by chance is 0.5. However, since the first witness is more likely to correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller than to incorrectly identify a person as shorter than 185 cm, we can adjust this probability accordingly. Specifically, if the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time, then the overall probability of B occurring by chance is 0.5 * (0.80 + 0.20) = 0.5.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of A given B:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.5
= 0.24

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24.
