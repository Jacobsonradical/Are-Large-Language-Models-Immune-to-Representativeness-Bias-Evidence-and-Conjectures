To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15% or 0.15).

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness is correct, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm:
- P(not A) = 0.85
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness is incorrect, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
