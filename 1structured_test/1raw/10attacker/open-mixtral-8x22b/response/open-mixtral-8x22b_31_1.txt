To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we know:

P(A) = probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(not A) = probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Now, let's calculate P(B|A) and P(B|not A) using the witness's accuracy:

P(B|A) = probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(B|not A) = probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.2

Next, we calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41379

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.41379 or 41.379%.
