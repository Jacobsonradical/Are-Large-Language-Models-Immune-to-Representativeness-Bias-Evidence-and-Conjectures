To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information provided about the witnesses and the population height distribution. We'll use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (based on the population height distribution) with the evidence provided by the witnesses.

First, let's denote the following events:
A: the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We know the following probabilities from the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are actually 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬A) = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the evidence provided by the witnesses:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

Since the testimonies of the witnesses are independent, we can simplify this to:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1) \* P(W2)

Now we need to calculate P(W1) and P(W2), the probabilities of the witnesses making their respective claims:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(W2) = P(W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values we have:

P(W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.31
P(W2) = 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.655

Now we can calculate P(A|W1, W2):

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / (0.31 \* 0.655) ≈ 0.32

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
