To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witnesses and the population height distribution. However, we must note that the witnesses' testimonies are independent of each other and the population height distribution.

First, let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H). According to the given information, the base rate or prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15.

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies. We have two witnesses, each with their own accuracy rates. Let's denote the accuracy of the first witness as A1 = 0.8 and the second witness as A2 = 0.7.

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our estimate of P(H) based on their testimonies.

Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability P(H|E) of a hypothesis H given evidence E is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

In our case, the evidence E is the testimonies of the two witnesses. Since their testimonies are independent, we can calculate their joint probability by multiplying their individual probabilities:

P(E) = P(E1) \* P(E2)

Now, let's calculate the posterior probability given the testimony of the first witness:

P(H|E1) = P(E1|H) \* P(H) / P(E1)

P(H|E1) = A1 \* P(H) / (A1 \* P(H) + (1 - A1) \* (1 - P(H)))

P(H|E1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)

P(H|E1) ≈ 0.286

Now let's calculate the posterior probability given the testimony of the second witness:

P(H|E2) = P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E2)

P(H|E2) = A2 \* P(H) / (A2 \* P(H) + (1 - A2) \* (1 - P(H)))

P(H|E2) = 0.7 \* 0.15 / (0.7 \* 0.15 + 0.3 \* 0.85)

P(H|E2) ≈ 0.194

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can update our estimate of P(H) by multiplying the two posterior probabilities:

P(H|E1,E2) = P(H|E1) \* P(H|E2)

P(H|E1,E2) ≈ 0.286 \* 0.194

P(H|E1,E2) ≈ 0.0555

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses, is approximately 0.0555 or 5.55%.

Final answer:{probability: 0.0555}
