To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population height distribution, and the new evidence is the witness testimonies.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as W1. We're looking for the conditional probability P(A|W1).

First, we know from the population data that P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the conditional probabilities P(W1|A) and P(W1|¬A). From the witness's accuracy, we know that P(W1|A) = 0.8 and P(¬W1|A) = 0.2, and P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 and P(¬W1|¬A) = 0.8.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We know P(W1|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(W1). We can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(A) \* P(W1|A) + P(¬A) \* P(W1|¬A)

Substituting the known values:

P(W1) = 0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.26

Now we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

P(A|W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.26 ≈ 0.4615

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4615.
