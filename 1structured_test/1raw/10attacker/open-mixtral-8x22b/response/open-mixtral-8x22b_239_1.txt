To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability and the witness testimonies.

The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 15% based on the population distribution.

For the witness testimonies, we need to consider the accuracy of each witness and the fact that they provided conflicting accounts.

The first witness was correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. If the first witness is correct, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be 0.8.

The second witness was correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time. If the second witness is correct, the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm would be 0.7.

However, we don't know which witness is correct in this specific case. To estimate the overall probability, we can consider a weighted average of the two scenarios, where the weights are the reliability of the witnesses.

Let P(H) be the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(H) = P(H|W1)P(W1) + P(H|W2)P(W2)

where P(H|W1) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness was correct, P(W1) is the probability that the first witness was correct, P(H|W2) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the second witness was correct, and P(W2) is the probability that the second witness was correct.

We know that P(W1) = 0.8 and P(W2) = 0.7, so we need to find P(H|W1) and P(H|W2).

If the first witness was correct, then P(H|W1) = 1. If the second witness was correct, then P(H|W2) = 0.

Now we can substitute these values into the equation:

P(H) = 1*0.8 + 0*0.7 = 0.8

However, this calculation assumes that the witnesses are independent and that their testimonies are equally reliable, which may not be the case. To account for this, we can consider the prior probability and the reliability of the witnesses in a Bayesian framework.

Let P(H|W1) be the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony, P(W1|H) be the likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually that height, P(W1|\~H) be the likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was not actually that height, P(H) be the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and P(\~H) be the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H)P(H)/[P(W1|H)P(H) + P(W1|\~H)P(\~H)]

We know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(\~H) = 0.85. We also know that P(W1|H) = 0.8 and P(W1|\~H) = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(H|W1) = 0.8*0.15/(0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85) = 0.434

This is the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

To incorporate the second witness's testimony, we can use a similar calculation:

P(H|W2) = P(W2|H)P(H)/[P(W2|H)P(H) + P(W2|\~H)P(\~H)]

We know that P(W2|H) = 0.3 and P(W2|\~H) = 0.7.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(H|W2) = 0.3*0.15/(0.3*0.15 + 0.7*0.85) = 0.071

This is the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the second witness's testimony.

To combine the two witnesses' testimonies, we can use a weighted average based on their reliability:

P(H) = P(H|W1)P(W1) + P(H|W2)P(W2) = 0.434*0.8 + 0.071*0.7 = 0.383

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the available information, is:

{probability: 0.383}
