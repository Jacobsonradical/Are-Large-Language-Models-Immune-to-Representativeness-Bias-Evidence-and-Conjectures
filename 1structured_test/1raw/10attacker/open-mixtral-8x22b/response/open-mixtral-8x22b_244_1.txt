To estimate the probability, we can use the Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that there's a 15% probability that a randomly selected person from the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(H) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15)
- P(E|H) as the probability of the witness evidence given that the person is 185 cm or taller
- P(E|~H) as the probability of the witness evidence given that the person is shorter than 185 cm

We're asked to find P(H|E), the probability of the person being 185 cm or taller given the witness evidence.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / [P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time:
- P(E|H) = 0.8
- P(E|~H) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time)

We also know that the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, P(~H), is 0.85.

Now, we can plug in the values:
P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.391

So, based on the evidence provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.391 or 39.1%.
