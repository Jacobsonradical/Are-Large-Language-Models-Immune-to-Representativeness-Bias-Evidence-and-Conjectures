To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem. We have two witnesses with different assessments of the attacker's height and varying accuracy in their judgments. We also know the height distribution in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2 as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the city's population data.
- P(B1|A) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the first witness's accuracy.
- P(B1|~A) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to the first witness's error rate.
- P(B2|A) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 according to the second witness's error rate.
- P(B2|~A) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is indeed shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 according to the second witness's accuracy.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B1, B2) as follows:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Since B1 and B2 are conditionally independent given A, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) / [P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|~A) \* P(B2|~A) \* P(~A)]

Now, plug in the values:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.7 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.3 \* 0.85)]

After calculating, we find that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.618.
