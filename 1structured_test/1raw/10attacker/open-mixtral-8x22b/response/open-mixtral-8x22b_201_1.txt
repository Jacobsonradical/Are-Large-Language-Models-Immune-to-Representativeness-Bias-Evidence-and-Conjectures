To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let E1 be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(A), the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%). We are also given that P(E1|A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%).

We need to find P(A|E1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed it was.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E1) = P(E1|A) \* P(A) / P(E1).

We know P(E1|A) and P(A), but we don't know P(E1), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To find P(E1), we can use the law of total probability: P(E1) = P(E1|A) \* P(A) + P(E1|not A) \* P(not A).

We know P(not A) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%). We are given that P(E1|not A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter, is 0.2 (20%).

So, P(E1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.29.

Now we can find P(A|E1) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|E1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41.

So, based on the evidence provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (41%).
