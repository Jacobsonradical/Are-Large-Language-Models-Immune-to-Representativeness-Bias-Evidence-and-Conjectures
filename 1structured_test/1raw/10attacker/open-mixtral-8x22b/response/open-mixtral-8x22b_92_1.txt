To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A given an event B is equal to the probability of B given A, times the probability of A, divided by the probability of B. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We can denote the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(A), which is given as 0.15. The probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is denoted as P(B|A), which is given as 0.80. The probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height is denoted as P(B), which can be calculated as the weighted average of the probabilities of the witness being correct and incorrect, given the distribution of heights in the population.

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

where P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85, and P(B|not A) is the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.41

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
