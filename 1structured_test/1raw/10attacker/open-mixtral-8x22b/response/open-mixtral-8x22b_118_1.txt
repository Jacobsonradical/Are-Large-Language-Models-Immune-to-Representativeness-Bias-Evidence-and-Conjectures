To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is that there is a 15% chance that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller.

The evidence we have is the testimony of two witnesses. Let's denote witness 1 as W1 and witness 2 as W2. We know that W1 has an accuracy of 80% and W2 has an accuracy of 70%. We also know that W1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A. We want to find P(A|W1, W2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

Here, P(W1, W2|A) is the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. P(A) is our prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15. P(W1, W2) is the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies, which we can compute from the accuracy of the witnesses and the base rates of the population.

First, let's compute P(W1, W2|A):

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A)

P(W1|A) is the probability that W1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. P(W2|A) is the probability that W2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3.

So, P(W1, W2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24.

Next, let's compute P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Here, ¬A denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W1, W2|¬A) is the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can compute this as follows:

P(W1, W2|¬A) = P(W1|¬A) \* P(W2|¬A)

P(W1|¬A) is the probability that W1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2. P(W2|¬A) is the probability that W2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7.

So, P(W1, W2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14.

Now we can compute P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155.

Finally, we can compute P(A|W1, W2):

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 = 0.227.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 0.227.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.227}.
