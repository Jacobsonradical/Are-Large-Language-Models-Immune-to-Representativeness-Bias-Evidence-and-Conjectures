To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population distribution of heights, and the new evidence is the witness testimonies. Here's how we can approach this:

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases where the first witness is correct and where they are wrong:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
