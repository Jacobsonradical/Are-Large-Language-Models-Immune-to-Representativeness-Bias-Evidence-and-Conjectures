To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H) given that the first witness claimed so (W1).

Let's denote the following:
- P(H): the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 15%.
- P(~H): the prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.
- P(W1|H): the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this is 80%.
- P(W1|~H): the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate of the first witness, which is 20%.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / (P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H))

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / (0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85)

P(H|W1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 (41%).

{probability: 0.41}
