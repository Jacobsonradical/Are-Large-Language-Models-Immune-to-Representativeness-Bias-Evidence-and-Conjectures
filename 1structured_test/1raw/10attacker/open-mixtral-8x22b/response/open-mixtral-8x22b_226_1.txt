To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- H as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W1 as the event "the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W2 as the event "the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"

We start with the prior probability P(H) = 0.15, as given in "b".

Next, we calculate the likelihoods P(W1|H) and P(W2|~H). From "a", we know that the first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, so P(W1|H) = 0.8. Similarly, the second witness identifies the correct height 70% of the time, so P(W2|~H) = 0.7.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief in H based on the evidence from the witnesses:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H)P(H) / P(W1, W2)

Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate P(W1, W2|H) or P(W1, W2) directly. However, we can make a simplifying assumption that the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the actual height of the attacker. This means that the probability of both witnesses giving their testimony does not depend on the other witness's testimony, given the true height of the attacker.

With this assumption, we have:

P(H|W1, W2) ≈ P(W1|H)P(W2|H)P(H) / P(W1)P(W2)

Since P(W1) = P(H)P(W1|H) + P(~H)P(W1|~H) and P(W2) = P(H)P(W2|H) + P(~H)P(W2|~H), we can calculate these probabilities using the given information:

P(W1) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.31
P(W2) = 0.15 * 0.3 + 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.655

Now we can calculate the updated probability:

P(H|W1, W2) ≈ (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.31 * 0.655) ≈ 0.129

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.129.
