To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the overall distribution of heights in the population (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness statements.

Let's denote:
- H as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- E1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- E2 as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witness statements.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct (P(E1|H)) and incorrect (P(E1|¬H)):
- P(E1|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).
- P(E1|¬H) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller).

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the second witness being correct (P(E2|¬H)) and incorrect (P(E2|H)):
- P(E2|¬H) = 0.7 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm).
- P(E2|H) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(H|E1, E2):

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

In this case, we can assume that the witnesses' testimonies are independent, given the height of the attacker. So:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)
P(E1, E2|¬H) = P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H)

P(E1, E2) is the probability of both witness statements occurring, regardless of the attacker's height, and can be calculated as:

P(E1, E2) = P(H) \* P(E1, E2|H) + P(¬H) \* P(E1, E2|¬H)

Now, we can plug in the values and calculate the probabilities:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)) = 0.144 / (0.144 + 0.119) ≈ 0.55

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness statements, is approximately 0.55 or 55%.
