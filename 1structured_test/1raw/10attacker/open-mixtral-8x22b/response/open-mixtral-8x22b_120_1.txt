To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the population distribution of heights, and the evidence comes from the witness statements.

First, let's establish our prior probability using the population distribution:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15
P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Now, let's consider the witness statements. We have two witnesses with different accuracy rates. To simplify the calculation, let's assume that the witnesses' judgments are independent of each other.

Witness 1:
P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 80% = 0.8
P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2

Witness 2:
P(W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 30% = 0.3
P(W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = 70% = 0.7

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statements:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm) = P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm)

P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15

P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm) = P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) + P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(Attacker < 185 cm)

P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) = P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm) * P(W2 claims < 185 cm | Attacker < 185 cm)
= 0.2 * 0.7
= 0.14

P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85

P(W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
= 0.036 + 0.119
= 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1 claims ≥ 185 cm, W2 claims < 185 cm) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155
≈ 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
