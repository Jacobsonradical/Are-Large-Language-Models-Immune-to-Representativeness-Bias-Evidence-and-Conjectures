This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem, which can help us update our prior probability (based on the population distribution) with the new evidence provided by the witnesses.

First, let's denote the following:
- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B, C), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) / P(B, C)

P(B, C|A) is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each witness making their claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(B, C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

We also need to find P(B, C), which is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims. This can be found using the law of total probability:

P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) + P(B, C|¬A) * P(¬A)

P(B, C|¬A) is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each witness making their claim given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B, C|¬A) = P(B|¬A) * P(C|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can find P(B, C):

P(B, C) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can find P(A|B, C):

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) * P(A) / P(B, C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155 ≈ 0.229

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.229, given the second witness's contradictory claim.
