To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (0.80).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.20).
- P(~A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (0.85).

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Substitute the given values:

P(A|B) = [(0.80) * (0.15)] / [(0.80) * (0.15) + (0.20) * (0.85)]

Simplify and compute:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
