To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the witness statements.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1).

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (from the population statistics), P(B1|A) = 0.8 (from the first witness's accuracy), and we need to find P(B1).

P(B1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This can be found by considering both possibilities for the attacker's height:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|~A) \* P(~A),

where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(B1|~A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness is accurate 80% of the time, they are inaccurate 20% of the time, so P(B1|~A) = 0.2.

We also know that P(~A) = 0.85 (from the population statistics).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B1) gives:

P(B1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.28.

Now we can find P(A|B1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.43.

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed this, is approximately 0.43.
