To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses.

We start with the prior probability, which is the proportion of the population in the city that is 185 cm or taller. According to information (b), this is 15%.

Next, we consider the likelihood of each witness's testimony given the true height of the attacker. For the first witness, the likelihood of their testimony if the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80%, and the likelihood of their testimony if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 20%. For the second witness, the likelihood of their testimony if the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 30%, and the likelihood of their testimony if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 70%.

Assuming that the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the true height of the attacker, we can multiply the likelihoods of each witness's testimony to get the overall likelihood of their combined testimony given the true height of the attacker. This gives us:

* Likelihood of both testimonies if attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
* Likelihood of both testimonies if attacker is shorter than 185 cm: 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on the witnesses' testimonies. The posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies is:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability \* Likelihood of both testimonies if attacker is 185 cm or taller) / (Prior probability \* Likelihood of both testimonies if attacker is 185 cm or taller + (1 - Prior probability) \* Likelihood of both testimonies if attacker is shorter than 185 cm))

Substituting the values we have, we get:

Posterior probability = (0.15 \* 0.24) / (0.15 \* 0.24 + (1 - 0.15) \* 0.14) = 0.26

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.26 or 26%.
