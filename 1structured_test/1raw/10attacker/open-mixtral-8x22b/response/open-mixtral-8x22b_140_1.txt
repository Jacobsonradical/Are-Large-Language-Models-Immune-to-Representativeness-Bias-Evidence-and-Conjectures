To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the distribution of heights in the population (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller).

First, let's denote the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We know:
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (the prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
