To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief is the population distribution (given in "b"), and our new evidence is the witness testimonies (given in "a").

Let's denote the following:
- H: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- ¬H: The event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
- E1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- E2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Our prior probabilities, based on the population distribution, are:
P(H) = 0.15
P(¬H) = 0.85

The likelihood of each witness's testimony given the true height of the attacker is provided in "a". We can write this as:
P(E1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(E1|¬H) = 0.20 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(E2|H) = 0.30 (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(E2|¬H) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

Note that P(E1, E2|H) is the joint probability of both witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can write this as:
P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)

Similarly, P(E1, E2) is the joint probability of both witnesses' testimonies. This can be written as:
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Now, we can calculate the required probabilities:
P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(E1, E2|¬H) = P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.1626

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2) ≈ 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.1626 ≈ 0.2214

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.2214.
