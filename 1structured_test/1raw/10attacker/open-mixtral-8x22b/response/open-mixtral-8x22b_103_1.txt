To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness identified them as such.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where P(B|~A) is the probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|~A) = 0.20 (The first witness makes a mistake 20% of the time when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(B) and P(A|B):

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|B) = [(0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29] = 0.41379310344827586

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 or 41%. However, this is just an estimate based on the given information and the assumption that the witness's performance on the sample is representative of their performance in this case.
