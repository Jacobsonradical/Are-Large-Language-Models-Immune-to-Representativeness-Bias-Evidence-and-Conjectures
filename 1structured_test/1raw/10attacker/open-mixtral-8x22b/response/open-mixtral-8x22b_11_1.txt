To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, our prior probability is the population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller), and the new evidence is the witness statements.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- P(B1|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
- P(B1|¬A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.
- P(B2|A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30.
- P(B2|¬A): The probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70.

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

To simplify the calculation, we can assume that the witness statements are conditionally independent given the attacker's height (i.e., the first witness's statement does not depend on the second witness's statement, and vice versa). This allows us to write:

P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A)
P(B1, B2|¬A) = P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A)

Now we can calculate P(B1, B2) using the law of total probability:

P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1, B2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B1, B2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1, B2):

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85))

This gives us a probability of approximately 0.22. Therefore, based on the available information and assuming conditional independence of the witness statements, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.22.
