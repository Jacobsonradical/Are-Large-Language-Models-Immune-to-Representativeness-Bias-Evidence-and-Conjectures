To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, our prior belief comes from the population statistics (b), and the new evidence comes from the witness testimonies (a).

First, let's define some variables:
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can simplify this to:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1) \* P(E2)

Now, let's plug in the given probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(E1|H) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

Since the second witness's testimony is that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we need to consider the probability that they would make this claim given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:
P(E2|H) = 0.3

Now, we need to find P(E1) and P(E2). Since the first witness's testimony is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that they would make this claim regardless of the actual height:
P(E1) = P(H) \* P(E1|H) + P(not H) \* P(E1|not H)
P(E1) = 0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2

Similarly, we need to find the probability that the second witness would claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm regardless of the actual height:
P(E2) = P(H) \* P(E2|H) + P(not H) \* (1 - P(E2|not H))
P(E2) = 0.15 \* 0.3 + 0.85 \* 0.7

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies:
P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1) \* P(E2)
P(H|E1, E2) = 0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 / (0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2) \* (0.15 \* 0.3 + 0.85 \* 0.7)

After plugging in the numbers and simplifying, we get:
P(H|E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.16

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.16 or 16%.
