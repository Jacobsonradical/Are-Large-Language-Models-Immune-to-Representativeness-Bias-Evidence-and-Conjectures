To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is based on the population height distribution, and the new evidence comes from the witness testimonies.

First, let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Our goal is to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) / P(B,C)

Since the witness testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we can simplify the equation as follows:

P(A|B,C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(B,C)

Now, let's plug in the given probabilities:

P(A) (prior probability) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) (probability the first witness is correct) = 0.8 (80% of the time)
P(C|A) (probability the second witness is incorrect) = 0.3 (30% of the time)

However, we don't have P(B,C), the joint probability of both witness testimonies. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) \* P(A) + P(B,C|~A) \* P(~A)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can split this into:

P(B,C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(B|~A) \* P(C|~A) \* P(~A)

Now we have:

P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (20% of the time, the first witness is incorrect)
P(C|~A) = 0.7 (70% of the time, the second witness is correct)

Plugging in the values:

P(B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)

Now we can calculate P(A|B,C):

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85))

Calculating the values:

P(A|B,C) â‰ˆ 0.22 (rounded to two decimal places)
