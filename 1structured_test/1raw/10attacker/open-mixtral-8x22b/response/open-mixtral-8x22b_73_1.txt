To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on the evidence provided by the witnesses.

First, let's define some variables:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
E1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
E2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(H | E1, E2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can express this probability as:

P(H | E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

We know the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(E1 | H) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(E2 | not H) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know that:

P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witnesses' testimonies given the height of the attacker:

P(E1, E2 | H) = P(E1 | H) \* P(E2 | H)
P(E2 | H) = 1 - P(not E2 | H) (the probability that the second witness is wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(not E2 | H) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time)

So, P(E1, E2 | H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Now we need to calculate P(E1, E2), the probability of both witnesses giving their respective testimonies. We can use the law of total probability:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2 | not H) \* P(not H)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the height of the attacker, we can simplify this to:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1 | H) \* P(E2 | H) \* P(H) + P(E1 | not H) \* P(E2 | not H) \* P(not H)

P(E1 | not H) = 1 - P(not E1 | not H) (the probability that the first witness is wrong when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not E1 | not H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time)

P(E2 | not H) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(E1, E2):

P(E1, E2) = 0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can find P(H | E1, E2):

P(H | E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.232

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
