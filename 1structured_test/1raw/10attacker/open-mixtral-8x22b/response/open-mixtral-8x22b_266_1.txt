To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Our prior probability is the general population distribution of heights in the city:
P(h ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15
P(h < 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

The new evidence comes from the two witnesses. Let's denote witness 1's claim as E1 and witness 2's claim as E2. We want to find the posterior probability P(h ≥ 185 cm | E1, E2).

Witness 1 has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone's height, so the probability that they accurately claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
P(E1 | h ≥ 185 cm) = 80% = 0.8
P(E1 | h < 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2 (since they incorrectly claim the attacker is tall 20% of the time)

Witness 2 has a 70% chance of correctly identifying someone's height, so the probability that they accurately claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:
P(E2 | h < 185 cm) = 70% = 0.7
P(E2 | h ≥ 185 cm) = 30% = 0.3 (since they incorrectly claim the attacker is short 30% of the time)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies:
P(h ≥ 185 cm | E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | h ≥ 185 cm) * P(h ≥ 185 cm) / P(E1, E2)

We can simplify the calculation by assuming that the witnesses' claims are independent (i.e., the accuracy of one witness's claim does not affect the accuracy of the other witness's claim). This allows us to write:
P(E1, E2 | h ≥ 185 cm) = P(E1 | h ≥ 185 cm) * P(E2 | h ≥ 185 cm)

Now we can plug in the values:
P(h ≥ 185 cm | E1, E2) = (0.8 * 0.3) * 0.15 / P(E1, E2)

We also need to calculate P(E1, E2) using the law of total probability:
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | h ≥ 185 cm) * P(h ≥ 185 cm) + P(E1, E2 | h < 185 cm) * P(h < 185 cm)

Again, assuming the witnesses' claims are independent:
P(E1, E2 | h < 185 cm) = P(E1 | h < 185 cm) * P(E2 | h < 185 cm)

Plug in the values:
P(E1, E2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(h ≥ 185 cm | E1, E2) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we get:
P(h ≥ 185 cm | E1, E2) ≈ 0.22

So, based on the given information and assuming independence between the witnesses' claims, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.22 or 22%.
