To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|~A) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

First, calculate P(~A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, substitute the given values into Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = [(0.80 * 0.15)] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
