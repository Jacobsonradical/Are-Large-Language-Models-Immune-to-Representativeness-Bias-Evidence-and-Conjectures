To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates conditional probabilities. Let's denote the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know that P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) and P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
