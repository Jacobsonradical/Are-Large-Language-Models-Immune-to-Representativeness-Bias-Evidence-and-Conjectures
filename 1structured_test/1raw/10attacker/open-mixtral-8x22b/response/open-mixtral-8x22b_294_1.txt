To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability (based on the population statistics) with the witness testimonies.

Our prior probability (P(H)) is based on the population statistics:
- P(H) = Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(¬H) = Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies as evidence (E1 for the first witness and E2 for the second witness):

For the first witness:
- P(E1|H) = Probability that the first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- P(E1|¬H) = Probability that the first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.2

For the second witness:
- P(E2|H) = Probability that the second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.3
- P(E2|¬H) = Probability that the second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.7

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

To find P(E1, E2|H) and P(E1, E2|¬H), we can use the independence of the witness testimonies:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(E1, E2|¬H) = P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can find the posterior probability:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] = 0.324 / (0.324 + 0.119) = 0.324 / 0.443 = 0.7314

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.7314 or 73.14%.
