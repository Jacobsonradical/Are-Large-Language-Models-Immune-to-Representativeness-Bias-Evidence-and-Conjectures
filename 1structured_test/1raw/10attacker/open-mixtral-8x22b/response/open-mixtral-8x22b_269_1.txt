To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population and the reliability of the witnesses.

First, let's consider the base rate. According to the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, before considering any witness testimony.

Next, let's consider the witness testimony. The first witness is correct about a person's height 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

To calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we have two witnesses with conflicting testimonies, we need to consider both scenarios:

1. The first witness is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The second witness is correct, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote P(T) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(~T) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(W1|T) as the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W2|~T) as the probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(T|W1) as the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|~T) \* P(~T)]

P(T|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

P(T|W1) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(T|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(T|W1) ≈ 0.41

Similarly, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the second witness claimed so:

P(~T|W2) = P(W2|~T) \* P(~T) / [P(W2|~T) \* P(~T) + P(W2|T) \* P(T)]

P(~T|W2) = 0.70 \* 0.85 / [0.70 \* 0.85 + 0.30 \* 0.15]

P(~T|W2) = 0.595 / [0.595 + 0.045]

P(~T|W2) = 0.595 / 0.64

P(~T|W2) ≈ 0.93

Since the two witnesses have conflicting testimonies, we need to consider both scenarios and combine them to get an overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote P(A) as the overall estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W1) as the probability that the first witness is correct, and P(W2) as the probability that the second witness is correct.

P(A) = P(T|W1) \* P(W1) + P(T|W2) \* P(W2)

Since the two witnesses have conflicting testimonies, we can assume that they are equally likely to be correct. Therefore, P(W1) = P(W2) = 0.5.

P(A) = 0.41 \* 0.5 + 0.07 \* 0.5

P(A) = 0.205 + 0.035

P(A) ≈ 0.24

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.24.
