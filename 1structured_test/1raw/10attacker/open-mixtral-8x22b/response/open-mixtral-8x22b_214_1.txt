To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claimed that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know the following:

- P(A): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that tall is 80% or 0.8.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

We know the following:

- P(B|A): As mentioned before, 80% or 0.8.
- P(¬A): The probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.
- P(B|¬A): The probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter is the false positive rate of the witness, which is 20% or 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the desired probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
