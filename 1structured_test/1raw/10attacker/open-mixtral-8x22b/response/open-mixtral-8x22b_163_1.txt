To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is used to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
P(A): The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
P(B|A): The probability that the witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
P(B|~A): The probability that the witness claims the person is 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We also know that:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
Where P(~A) is the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Substituting the given values:
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29

So,
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
