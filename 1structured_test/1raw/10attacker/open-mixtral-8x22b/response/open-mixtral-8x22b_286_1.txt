To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the prior probability is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 15%.

We have two witnesses, each with a different accuracy in judging height. Let's calculate the posterior probability given the testimony of each witness and then combine these probabilities based on the witnesses' relative accuracy.

First witness:
- Probability of witness being correct = 0.8
- Probability of witness being incorrect = 0.2
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) = P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) / P(Witness 1 says tall)

Since P(Witness 1 says tall) = P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short), we need to calculate P(Attacker is short), which is 85% or 0.85.

P(Witness 1 says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.255

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 ≈ 0.4706

Second witness:
- Probability of witness being correct = 0.7
- Probability of witness being incorrect = 0.3
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem for the second witness:
P(Attacker is tall | Witness 2 says short) = P(Witness 2 says short | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) / P(Witness 2 says short)

P(Witness 2 says short) = P(Witness 2 says short | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness 2 says short | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short)

P(Witness 2 says short) = (0.3 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85) = 0.64

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(Attacker is tall | Witness 2 says short) = (0.3 * 0.15) / 0.64 ≈ 0.0703

Since the first witness is more accurate than the second witness, we can give more weight to the first witness's testimony. However, we should still consider the second witness's testimony to some extent.

Let's use a weighted average based on the witnesses' accuracy:
Weight for Witness 1 = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.7) ≈ 0.5333
Weight for Witness 2 = 0.7 / (0.8 + 0.7) ≈ 0.4667

Combined probability:
P(Attacker is tall) = (Weight for Witness 1 * P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall)) + (Weight for Witness 2 * P(Attacker is tall | Witness 2 says short))

P(Attacker is tall) ≈ (0.5333 * 0.4706) + (0.4667 * 0.0703) ≈ 0.2989

Based on the information provided and the calculations above, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2989.
