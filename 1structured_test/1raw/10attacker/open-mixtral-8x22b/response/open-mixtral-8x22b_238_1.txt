To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The first witness claimed that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller (0.15, given in the problem).
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness claimed the height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8, given in the problem).
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness claimed the height was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2, given in the problem).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

First, let's calculate P(~A), the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 185 cm:

P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, let's plug in the values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
