To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)

To find P(B), we need to consider both the cases when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (A) and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A). So:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We know that:
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
