To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimates as we receive new information. In this case, the new information comes from the witnesses.

Let's denote:
- A: the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the city's population statistics.
- P(B1|A): the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
- P(B1|¬A): the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.
- P(B2|A): the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7.
- P(B2|¬A): the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3.

Now, we need to find P(A|B1, B2), the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) \* P(A) / P(B1, B2)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can simplify this as:

P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) / (P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A) \* P(¬A))

Now, we can plug in the given probabilities:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / ((0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85))

After calculating this expression, we find that:

P(A|B1, B2) ≈ 0.254

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.254.
