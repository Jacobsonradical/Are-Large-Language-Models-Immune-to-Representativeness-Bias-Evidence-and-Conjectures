To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- C: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know the following probabilities:

- P(A) = 0.15 (The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (The probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (The probability that the first witness is incorrect given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (The probability that the second witness is incorrect given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (The probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so (B) and the second witness claimed the opposite (C). We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C)

First, we need to find P(B, C|A) and P(B, C).

P(B, C|A) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) + P(B, C|¬A) \* P(¬A)

To find P(B, C|¬A), we need to consider the case when both witnesses are incorrect:

P(B, C|¬A) = P(B|¬A) \* P(C|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06

Now we can find P(B, C):

P(B, C) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.06 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.051 = 0.087

Finally, we can find P(A|B, C):

P(A|B, C) = P(B, C|A) \* P(A) / P(B, C) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.087 ≈ 0.4023

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements is approximately 0.4023.
