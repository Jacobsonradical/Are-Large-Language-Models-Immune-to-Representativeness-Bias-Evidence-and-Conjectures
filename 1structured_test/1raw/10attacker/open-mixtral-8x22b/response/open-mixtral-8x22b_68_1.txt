To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Let's denote the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller as event A, and the witnesses' testimonies as events W1 and W2 (for the first and second witnesses, respectively).

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability, based on population statistics)
P(not A) = 0.85
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
P(W2|A) = 0.70 (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall)
P(W2|not A) = 0.30 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)

To find the posterior probability P(A|W1), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]

Calculating this value, we obtain:

P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3478

Thus, based on the information provided and using Bayesian inference, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3478.
