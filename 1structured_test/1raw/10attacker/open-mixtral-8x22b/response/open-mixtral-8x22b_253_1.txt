To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case is:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) / P(E1, E2)

where:
- H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E1 is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- E2 is the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm
- P(H|E1, E2) is the probability we want to find

First, let's find P(E1, E2|H), the probability that we'd get these witness statements given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) * P(E2|H)

P(E1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness was correct 80% of the time)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (the second witness was incorrect 30% of the time)

So, P(E1, E2|H) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Next, let's find P(H), the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's find P(E1, E2), the probability of getting these witness statements regardless of the attacker's height. This is a bit more complicated, as we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) + P(E1, E2|not H) * P(not H)

where:
- P(not H) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(E1, E2|not H) = P(E1|not H) * P(E2|not H) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

So, P(E1, E2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can find P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) * P(H) / P(E1, E2) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.23

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.23 or 23%.
