To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use the Bayesian approach, updating our prior probability with the likelihood information from the witnesses.

First, let's denote the events as follows:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Our prior probability of A is given by the population distribution:
P(A) = 15% = 0.15

The likelihoods of B and C given A (and given not-A) can be calculated as follows:
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the first witness identifies the correct height)
P(B|~A) = 20% = 0.2 (the first witness makes an error)
P(C|A) = 20% = 0.2 (the second witness makes an error)
P(C|~A) = 70% = 0.7 (the second witness identifies the correct height)

Now, let's update our prior with the likelihoods:
P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)

Since B and C are independent given A, we can write:
P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

And similarly:
P(B,C|~A) = P(B|~A) * P(C|~A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, let's calculate P(B,C):
P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) + P(B,C|~A) * P(~A)
P(B,C) = 0.16 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.1445

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(A|B,C) = (0.16 * 0.15) / 0.1445 â‰ˆ 0.1619

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1619 or 16.19%.
