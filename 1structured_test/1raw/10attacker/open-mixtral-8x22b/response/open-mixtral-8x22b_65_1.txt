To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A as the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B as the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A) of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population. According to the information given, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. We are told that the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(B|~A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time, so P(B|~A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

P(~A) is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can plug in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4737

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4737 or 47.37%.
