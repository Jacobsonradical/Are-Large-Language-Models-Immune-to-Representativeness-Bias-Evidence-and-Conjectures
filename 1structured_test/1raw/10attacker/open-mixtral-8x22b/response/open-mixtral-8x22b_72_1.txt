To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the given information about the population height distribution and the witness testimonies.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can assume that the prior probability (without any witness testimonies) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the witness testimonies. We have two witnesses, one with an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height and another with a 70% accuracy rate.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B1: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
B2: The event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1,B2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(A|B1,B2) as follows:

P(A|B1,B2) = P(B1,B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1,B2)

Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can simplify P(B1,B2|A) as:

P(B1,B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A)

Now, we can calculate P(B1|A) and P(B2|A) based on the witness accuracy rates:

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time)
P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identified the height, which has a 30% probability)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B1,B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, let's calculate P(B1,B2) using the law of total probability:

P(B1,B2) = P(B1,B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1,B2|~A) * P(~A)

Since P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and assuming the witnesses' accuracy rates for identifying a person shorter than 185 cm are the same as their accuracy rates for identifying a person 185 cm or taller, we can estimate P(B1,B2|~A) as:

P(B1,B2|~A) = P(B1|~A) * P(B2|~A) = (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.3) = 0.06

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B1,B2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.051 = 0.087

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1,B2):

P(A|B1,B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.087 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.414.
