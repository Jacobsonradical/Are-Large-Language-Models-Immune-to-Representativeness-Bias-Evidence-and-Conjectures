To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the witness testimonies.

First, let's consider the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, this probability is 15%, or 0.15.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of the witness testimonies given the attacker's height. For the first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance they are correct and a 20% chance they are mistaken. For the second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, there is a 70% chance they are correct and a 30% chance they are mistaken.

To update our prior belief, we can use the following formula:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Testimonies) = P(Testimonies | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Testimonies)

Assuming that the testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we can multiply the likelihoods of each testimony to obtain the overall likelihood:

P(Testimonies | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = P(Witness 1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Witness 2 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm)

= 0.8 \* (1 - 0.7)

= 0.8 \* 0.3

= 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate the overall likelihood of the testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(Testimonies | Attacker < 185 cm) = P(Witness 1 | Attacker < 185 cm) \* P(Witness 2 | Attacker < 185 cm)

= (1 - 0.8) \* 0.7

= 0.2 \* 0.7

= 0.14

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem to obtain the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Testimonies) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / (0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85)

= 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)

= 0.2323

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2323.

However, it is important to note that this estimate is based on several assumptions and simplifications, and the actual probability may vary depending on the specific circumstances of the case.
