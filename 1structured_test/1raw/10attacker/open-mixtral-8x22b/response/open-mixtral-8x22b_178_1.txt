To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) is proportional to the product of the prior probability and the likelihood.

The prior probability (P(H)) is given by the population distribution in the city:
P(H) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

The likelihood is the probability of the witness statements given the attacker's height. Since the witnesses gave contradictory statements, we'll consider the probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect if the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(W1|H) = P(first witness is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(W2|~H) = P(second witness is incorrect | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.3

The probability of both events happening together is given by the product of their probabilities:
P(W1|H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

The probability of both events happening given the alternative hypothesis (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is:
P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:
P(H|W1, W2) = P(H) \* P(W1|H) \* P(W2|~H) / [P(H) \* P(W1|H) \* P(W2|~H) + P(~H) \* P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|H)]

P(H|W1, W2) = 0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3 / [0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3 + 0.85 \* 0.2 \* 0.7]

P(H|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.209

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.209.

Final answer:
{probability: 0.209}
