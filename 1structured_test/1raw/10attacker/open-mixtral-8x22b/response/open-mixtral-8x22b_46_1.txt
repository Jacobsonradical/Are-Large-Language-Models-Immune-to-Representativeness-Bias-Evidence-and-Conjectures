To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

According to the information given:

- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): The probability that the witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B|~A): The probability that the witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm is 20% or 0.2.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

We know that P(~A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

So,

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.692307692 or approximately 69.23%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 69.23%.
