To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event B: The witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so.

According to the information provided, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller is 80%)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the probability that the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller is 20%)

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), we can substitute the values into the formula:

P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2857 or 28.57%.
