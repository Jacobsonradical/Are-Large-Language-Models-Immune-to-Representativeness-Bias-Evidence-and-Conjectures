To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness statements.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of each witness statement given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

For the first witness:
- The probability that they would correctly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
- The probability that they would incorrectly identify the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.2.

For the second witness:
- The probability that they would correctly identify the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.
- The probability that they would incorrectly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.3.

Now, let's calculate the joint probability for both witnesses given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (A) and given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (¬A).

P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \* P(W2 | A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2 | ¬A) = P(W1 | ¬A) \* P(W2 | ¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, let's calculate the probability of the evidence (both witness statements) P(W1, W2).

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2 | ¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.12 = 0.156

Finally, let's calculate the posterior probability P(A | W1, W2) using Bayes' theorem.

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.156 ≈ 0.2295

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2295.
