To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior probability based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B₁ as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B₂ as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B₁|A) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- P(B₁|A') as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.
- P(B₂|A) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 30% or 0.3.
- P(B₂|A') as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B₁, B₂) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B₁, B₂) = P(B₁, B₂|A) \* P(A) / P(B₁, B₂)

However, calculating P(B₁, B₂|A) and P(B₁, B₂) directly can be complex. Instead, we can consider the witnesses' testimonies separately and then combine them using the principle of conditional independence:

P(A|B₁, B₂) ∝ P(B₁|A) \* P(B₂|A) \* P(A) \* P(B₁|A') \* P(B₂|A') \* P(A')

Where P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood ratios for each witness:

LR₁ = P(B₁|A) / P(B₁|A') = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4
LR₂ = P(B₂|A') / P(B₂|A) = 0.7 / 0.3 = 2.33

The combined likelihood ratio is:

LR = LR₁ \* LR₂ = 4 \* 2.33 ≈ 9.32

Now, we can use the likelihood ratio to update our prior probability:

P(A|B₁, B₂) ∝ LR \* P(A)
P(A|B₁, B₂) ∝ 9.32 \* 0.15
P(A|B₁, B₂) ∝ 1.398

Since this is not a probability, we need to normalize it by dividing by the sum of the probabilities for both hypotheses (A and A'):

P(A|B₁, B₂) = 1.398 / (1.398 + 1) ≈ 0.585

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.585 or 58.5%.
