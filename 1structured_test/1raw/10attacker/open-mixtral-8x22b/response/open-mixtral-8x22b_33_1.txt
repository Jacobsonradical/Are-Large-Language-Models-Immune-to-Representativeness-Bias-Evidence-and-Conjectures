To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information given about the witnesses and the population height distribution.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the events that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1, and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as W2.

We are given the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(A) = 0.15, based on the population height distribution.

We are also given the conditional probabilities of the witnesses' claims given the attacker's height:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(W1|¬A) = 0.2, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W2|¬A) = 0.7, the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W2|A) = 0.3, the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the posterior probability P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2)

We can calculate P(W1, W2|A) as the joint probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3

Similarly, we can calculate P(W1, W2|¬A) as the joint probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1, W2|¬A) = P(W1|¬A) \* P(W2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7

Now we can calculate P(W1, W2) as the total probability of both witnesses making their respective claims:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we have:

P(W1, W2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|W1, W2):

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / P(W1, W2) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / 0.155 = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
