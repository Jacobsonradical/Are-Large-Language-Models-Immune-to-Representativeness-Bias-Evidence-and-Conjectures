To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior probability (the general probability of an event occurring) based on new evidence (the witness testimonies).

We are given the following probabilities:
Prior probability (P(A)): 15% or 0.15 (the general probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A): 80% or 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A): 30% or 0.3 (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, when they are actually 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B): the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed they were 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Here, P(~A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Let's calculate the probabilities:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.255]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
