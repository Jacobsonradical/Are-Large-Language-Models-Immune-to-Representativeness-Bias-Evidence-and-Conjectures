To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. In this case, the evidence is the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85.

Next, we have the accuracy rates of the witnesses. For the first witness, the accuracy is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|not A) = 0.8. For the second witness, the accuracy is 70%, so P(not C|not A) = 0.7 and P(C|A) = 0.7.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this and the second witness claimed the opposite:

P(A|B and C) = P(B and C|A) * P(A) / P(B and C)

However, we can't directly calculate P(B and C|A) or P(B and C) from the given information. Instead, we can use the law of total probability and the definition of conditional probability to find P(B and C):

P(B and C) = P(B and C|A) * P(A) + P(B and C|not A) * P(not A)

We also know that P(B and C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) and P(B and C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A).

Now, we can calculate these probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8
P(C|A) = 0.7
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
P(C|not A) = 1 - P(not C|not A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

So, P(B and C|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 and P(B and C|not A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06.

Finally, we can calculate P(B and C) and P(A|B and C):

P(B and C) = 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135
P(A|B and C) = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.135 = 0.084 / 0.135 â‰ˆ 0.6222

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies is approximately 0.6222.
