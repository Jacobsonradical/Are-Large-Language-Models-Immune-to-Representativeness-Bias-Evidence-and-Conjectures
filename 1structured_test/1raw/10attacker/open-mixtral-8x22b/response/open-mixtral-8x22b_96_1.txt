To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability and the likelihood based on the witness testimonies.

The prior probability, P(H), is the general probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

Now, let's consider the likelihood of the witness testimonies, P(E|H), where E is the event that a witness made a claim about the attacker's height. For the first witness, this probability is 80%, and for the second witness, it is 70%. However, since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony actually decreases the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

So, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our probability estimate:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

Where P(H|E) is the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, and P(E) is the prior probability of the witness testimonies, which we can assume to be 1 since it's a given that the witnesses made their claims.

However, since we have two conflicting testimonies, we can't directly apply Bayes' theorem. Instead, we can consider the testimonies as independent events and update our probability estimate sequentially.

Starting with the prior probability, P(H) = 0.15, and considering the first witness's testimony:

P(H|E1) = [P(E1|H) * P(H)] / P(E1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 1 = 0.12

Now, considering the second witness's testimony, which contradicts the first witness:

P(H|E2) = [P(E2|H) * P(H|E1)] / P(E2) = [0.3 * 0.12] / 1 = 0.036

However, this calculation assumes that the second witness's testimony is independent of the first witness's testimony, which might not be the case. In reality, the second witness's testimony might be influenced by the first witness's testimony, or the two testimonies might be correlated in some way. Without more information, it's difficult to accurately estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

But based on the available information and the assumption of independence, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.036}
