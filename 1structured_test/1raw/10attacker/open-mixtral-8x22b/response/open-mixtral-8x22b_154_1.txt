To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From the problem, we know:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

P(~A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating this gives us:

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.443

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.443.
