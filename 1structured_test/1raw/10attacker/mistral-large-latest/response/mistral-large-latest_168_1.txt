To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \).

First, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \) and \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \times P(B_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \times P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}}
\]
