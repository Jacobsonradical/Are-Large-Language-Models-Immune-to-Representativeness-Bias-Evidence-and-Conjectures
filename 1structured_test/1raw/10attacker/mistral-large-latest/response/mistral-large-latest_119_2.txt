To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the accuracy of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the witnesses' testimonies:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
