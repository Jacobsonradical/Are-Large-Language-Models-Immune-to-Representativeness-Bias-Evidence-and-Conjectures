To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses' reliability and the base rates of height in the population.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(C | A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B \cap C | A) \):
\[ P(B \cap C | A) = P(B | A) \cdot P(C | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B \cap C | \neg A) \):
\[ P(B \cap C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(C | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):
\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \cap C | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | B \cap C) \):
\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]
\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed {
  \{
    "probability": 0.232
  \}
}
\]
