To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the reliability of the witnesses:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( W1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) \):
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness is wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)

- \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (first witness is wrong when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \) (second witness is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.232} \]
