To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the witness testimonies and their reliability, along with the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as taller than or equal to 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as taller than or equal to 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the witness reliability:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)

Similarly, for the second witness:
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.

From the witness reliability:
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
