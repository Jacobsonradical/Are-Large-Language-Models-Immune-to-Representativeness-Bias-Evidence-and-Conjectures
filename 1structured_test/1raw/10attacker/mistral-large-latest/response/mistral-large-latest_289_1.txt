To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(C|A) = 0.30 \) (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(C|\neg A) = 0.70 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A|B \cap C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B \cap C|A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C|A) = P(B|A) \cdot P(C|A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B \cap C|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C|\neg A) = P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(C|\neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \cap C|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A|B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B \cap C) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.232\} \]
