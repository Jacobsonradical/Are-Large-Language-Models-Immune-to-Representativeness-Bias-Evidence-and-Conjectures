To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information from the witnesses with the prior probability of the attacker's height based on the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the witnesses' testimonies:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T | W1, W2) \), where \( W1 \) is the testimony of the first witness and \( W2 \) is the testimony of the second witness.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W1, W2 | T) \):
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect when the attacker is tall)

\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W1, W2 | S) \):
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect when the attacker is short)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is short)

\[ P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(T | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.232} \]
