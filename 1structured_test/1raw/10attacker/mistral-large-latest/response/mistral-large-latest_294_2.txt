To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.4138\} \]
