To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city and the reliability of the witnesses' statements.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
