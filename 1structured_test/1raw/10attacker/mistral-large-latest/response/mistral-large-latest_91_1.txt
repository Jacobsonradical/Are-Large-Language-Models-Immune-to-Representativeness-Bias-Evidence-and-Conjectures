To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

Next, let's consider the witnesses' reliability:
- Witness 1 (W1) claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Witness 2 (W2) claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Witness 1's reliability:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (correctly identifies taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (incorrectly identifies shorter as taller)

Witness 2's reliability:
- \( P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \) (correctly identifies shorter)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (incorrectly identifies taller as shorter)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T | W1, W2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | \neg T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the evidence \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
