To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (The first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(C|A) = 0.3 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- \( P(C|\neg A) = 0.7 \) (The second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A|B \cap C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B \cap C|A) \) and \( P(B \cap C|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C|A) = P(B|A) \cdot P(C|A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B \cap C|\neg A) = P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(C|\neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \cap C|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B \cap C) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
