To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the base rate of the population's height with the accuracy of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's consider the testimonies of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief based on the witnesses' testimonies.

First, let's calculate the likelihood of the testimonies given the attacker's height:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate the joint probability of both testimonies given the attacker's height:
- \( P(W1 \cap W2|T) = P(W1|T) \times P(W2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1 \cap W2|S) = P(W1|S) \times P(W2|S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies:
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2|T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2|S) \times P(S)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
