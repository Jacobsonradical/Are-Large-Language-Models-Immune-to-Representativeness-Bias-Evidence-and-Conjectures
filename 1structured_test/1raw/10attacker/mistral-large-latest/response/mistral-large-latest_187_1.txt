To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \).

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time: \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) and \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \)
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time: \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.7 \) and \( P(C | A) = 0.3 \)

First, calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A)P(A) + P(B \cap C | \neg A)P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B \cap C | A) = P(B | A) \cdot P(C | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B \cap C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(C | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(B \cap C) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A \cap B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A)P(A) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 = 0.036 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{P(A \cap B \cap C)}{P(B \cap C)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
