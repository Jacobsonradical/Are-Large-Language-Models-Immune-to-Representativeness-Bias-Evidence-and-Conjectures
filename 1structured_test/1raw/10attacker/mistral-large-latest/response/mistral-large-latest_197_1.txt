To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (First witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (First witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}} \]
