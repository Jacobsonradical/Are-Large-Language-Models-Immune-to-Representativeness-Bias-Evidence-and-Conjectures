To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the prior probabilities with the likelihoods given by the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person)
- \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies a short person)
- \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a tall person as short)

We need to calculate \( P(H | W1, W2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate the joint likelihood \( P(W1, W2 | H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate the joint likelihood \( P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the evidence \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability \( P(H | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{0.232}
\]
