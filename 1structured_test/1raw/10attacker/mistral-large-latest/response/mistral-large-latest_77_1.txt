To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S|T) = 0.80 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller).

We want to find \( P(T|S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{P(S|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(S)} \]

Where \( P(S) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is:
\[ P(S) = P(S|T) \cdot P(T) + P(S|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(S) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|S) \):
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
