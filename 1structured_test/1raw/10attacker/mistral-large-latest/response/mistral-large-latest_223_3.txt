To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probabilities and the reliability of the witnesses.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness reliabilities:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness is wrong given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness is wrong given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We need to calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2|S) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.2323} \]
