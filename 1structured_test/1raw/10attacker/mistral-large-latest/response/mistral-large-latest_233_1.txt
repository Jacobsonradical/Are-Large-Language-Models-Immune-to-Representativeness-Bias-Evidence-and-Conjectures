To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods provided by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
