To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information from the witnesses' reliability and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

The witnesses' reliability:
- Witness 1 (claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
  - Correct 80% of the time.
  - Errs 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 (claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
  - Correct 70% of the time.
  - Errs 30% of the time.

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 | T) \) is the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80%).
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15%).
- \( P(W1) \) is the total probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 | S) \) is the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20%).

\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W1) \):

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
