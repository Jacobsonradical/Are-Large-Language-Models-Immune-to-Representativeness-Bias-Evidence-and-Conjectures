To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (Prior probability, P(H)).
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time (P(E1|H) = 0.80).
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time (P(E2|H) = 0.70).

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the witnesses.

Let's denote:
- H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- ~H: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- E1: The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- E2: The second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(H|E1, E2).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E1, E2) = \frac{P(E1, E2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E1, E2)} \]

First, calculate P(E1, E2|H):
\[ P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \cdot P(E2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate P(E1, E2|~H):
\[ P(E1|~H) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(E2|~H) = 0.70 \]
\[ P(E1, E2|~H) = P(E1|~H) \cdot P(E2|~H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate P(E1, E2):
\[ P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) \cdot P(~H) \]
\[ P(E1, E2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E1, E2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate P(H|E1, E2):
\[ P(H|E1, E2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E1, E2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
