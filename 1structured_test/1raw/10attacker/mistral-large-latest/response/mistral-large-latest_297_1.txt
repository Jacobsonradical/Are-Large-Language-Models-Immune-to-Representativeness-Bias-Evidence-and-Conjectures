To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(S|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{P(S|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(S)} \]

Where \( P(S) \) is the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
\[ P(S) = P(S|T) \cdot P(T) + P(S|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(S) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|S) \):
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
