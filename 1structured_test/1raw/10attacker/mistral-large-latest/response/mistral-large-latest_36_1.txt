To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' statements.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

Let's denote:
- \( W1 \) as the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) as the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The probabilities of the witnesses' statements being correct are:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | S) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
