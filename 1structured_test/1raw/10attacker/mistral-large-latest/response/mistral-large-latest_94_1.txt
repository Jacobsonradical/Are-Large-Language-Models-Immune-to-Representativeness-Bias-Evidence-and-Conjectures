To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided by the witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' accuracy:
- Witness 1 (claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
  - Correct 80% of the time
  - Errs 20% of the time
- Witness 2 (claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
  - Correct 70% of the time
  - Errs 30% of the time

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements. We can use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( B \) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( C \) be the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \).

First, calculate the joint probability \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A)P(A) + P(B \cap C | \neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Where:
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect when the attacker is short)
- \( P(C | A) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is short)

\[ P(B \cap C | A) = P(B | A) \times P(C | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B \cap C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \times P(C | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(B \cap C) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A \cap B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A)P(A) = 0.24 \times 0.15 = 0.036 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{P(A \cap B \cap C)}{P(B \cap C)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed {
  \{
    "probability": 0.232
  \}
}
\]
