To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' statements.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness reliability:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (the base rate) with the evidence provided by the witnesses.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Calculating each term:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can find \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
