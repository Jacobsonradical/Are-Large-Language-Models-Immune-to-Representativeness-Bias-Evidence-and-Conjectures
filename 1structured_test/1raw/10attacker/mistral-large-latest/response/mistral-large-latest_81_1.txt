To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the base rate of the population's height with the accuracy of the witnesses' statements.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement (\( W1 \)) and the second witness's statement (\( W2 \)).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2|S) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.232} \]
