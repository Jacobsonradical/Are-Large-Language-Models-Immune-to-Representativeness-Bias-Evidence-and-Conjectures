To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.70 \)

We also need the probabilities that the witnesses are wrong:
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.30 \) (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

First, let's calculate the joint probability that both witnesses give their testimonies given the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2|T) = P(W1|T) \times P(W2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.70 = 0.56 \]

Next, let's calculate the joint probability that both witnesses give their testimonies given the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \times P(W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief:
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2|T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2|\neg T) \times P(\neg T)} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85} \]

Calculating the denominator:
\[ 0.56 \times 0.15 = 0.084 \]
\[ 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.051 \]
\[ 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

So the posterior probability is:
\[ P(T|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.622.

\[
\boxed{\{probability: 0.622\}}
\]
