To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the prior probability and the reliability of the witnesses' statements.

Given:
- The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller is 15% (0.15).
- The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% (0.85).

Witness reliabilities:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time (0.80) and incorrect 20% of the time (0.20).
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time (0.70) and incorrect 30% of the time (0.30).

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the witnesses' statements.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \).

First, calculate the likelihood of the witnesses' statements given the attacker's height:

- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (first witness is correct when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (first witness is incorrect when the attacker is not tall)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (second witness is incorrect when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (second witness is correct when the attacker is not tall)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
