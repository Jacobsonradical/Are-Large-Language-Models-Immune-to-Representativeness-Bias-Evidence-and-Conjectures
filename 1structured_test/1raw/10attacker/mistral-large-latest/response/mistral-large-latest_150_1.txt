To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time).
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

We need to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed { \text{{probability: 0.232}} } \]
