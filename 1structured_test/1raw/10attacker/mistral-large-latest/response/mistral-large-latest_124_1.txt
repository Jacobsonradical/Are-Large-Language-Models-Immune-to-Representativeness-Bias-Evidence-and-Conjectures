To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll incorporate the base rate of the population's height and the accuracy of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (First witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (First witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
