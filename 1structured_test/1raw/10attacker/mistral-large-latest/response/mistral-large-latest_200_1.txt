To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), where \( W1 \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W2 \) is the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2|\neg T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2323.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.2323} \]
