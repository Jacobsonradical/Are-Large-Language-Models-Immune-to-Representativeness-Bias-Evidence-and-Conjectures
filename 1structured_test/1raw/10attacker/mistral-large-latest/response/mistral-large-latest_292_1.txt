To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness is incorrect given the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that the second witness is incorrect given the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \) given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.70 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.30 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(\neg T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.56 \cdot 0.15) + (0.06 \cdot 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.622.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.622}} \]
