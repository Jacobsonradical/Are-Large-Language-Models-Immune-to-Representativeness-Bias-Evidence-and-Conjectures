To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the population and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{0.4138}
\]
