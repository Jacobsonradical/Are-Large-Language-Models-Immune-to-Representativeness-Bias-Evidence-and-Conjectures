To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.4138} \]
