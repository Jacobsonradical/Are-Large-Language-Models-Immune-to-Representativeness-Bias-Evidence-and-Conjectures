To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information given:

1. 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief (15% probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller) with the evidence from the witnesses.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

First, calculate the likelihoods:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (first witness is wrong when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (second witness is wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (second witness is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.232} \]
