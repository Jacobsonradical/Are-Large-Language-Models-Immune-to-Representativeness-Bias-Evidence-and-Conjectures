To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

The joint probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1|T) \times P(W2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

The joint probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = P(W1|S) \times P(W2|S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of the witnesses' testimonies is:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | S) \times P(S) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

The posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies is:
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]
