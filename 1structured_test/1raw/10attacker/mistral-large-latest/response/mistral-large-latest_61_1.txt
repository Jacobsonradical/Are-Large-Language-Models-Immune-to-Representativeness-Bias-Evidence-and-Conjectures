To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the information from the witnesses with the prior probability based on the population distribution.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness is correct 80% of the time:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \)

The second witness is correct 70% of the time:
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \). Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed {
  \text{{probability: 0.232}}
}
