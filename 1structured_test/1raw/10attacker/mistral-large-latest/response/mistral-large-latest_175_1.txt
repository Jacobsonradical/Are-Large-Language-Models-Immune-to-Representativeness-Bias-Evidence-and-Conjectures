To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of heights in the population and the accuracy of the witnesses.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness accuracies:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the population data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.

From the witness accuracies:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Calculating each term:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]
