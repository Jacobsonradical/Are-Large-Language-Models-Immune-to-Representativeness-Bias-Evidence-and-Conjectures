To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior beliefs based on the witness testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that Witness 1 is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (probability that Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that Witness 2 is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(A | W1, W2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height:

\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.232} \]
