To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our beliefs based on the witness testimonies and their reliability.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed { \text{{probability: 0.232}} } \]
