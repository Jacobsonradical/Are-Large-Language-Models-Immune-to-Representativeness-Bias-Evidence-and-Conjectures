To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
