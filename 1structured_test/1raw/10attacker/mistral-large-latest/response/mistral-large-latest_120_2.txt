To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote:
- \( W1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

We need to calculate \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \):
- The first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.80.
- The second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm with probability 0.30.

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) \):
- The first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.20.
- The second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm with probability 0.70.

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
