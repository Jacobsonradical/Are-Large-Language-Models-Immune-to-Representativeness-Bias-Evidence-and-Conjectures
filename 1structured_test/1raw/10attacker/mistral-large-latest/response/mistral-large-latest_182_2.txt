To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the population and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness reliabilities:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

We can use Bayes' theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \).

First, we calculate the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height:

\[ P(W_1 | A) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(W_2 | A) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is:

\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg A) = 0.85 \]

The joint probability of the witnesses' testimonies is:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
