To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1, W2|T) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1, W2|S) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate the total probability of the witnesses' testimonies:

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
