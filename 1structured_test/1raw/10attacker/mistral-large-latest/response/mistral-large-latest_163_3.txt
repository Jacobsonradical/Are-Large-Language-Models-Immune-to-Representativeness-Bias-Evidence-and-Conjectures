To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness reliabilities:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the population data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the witness reliability data:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 says so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\boxed{0.4138}
\]
