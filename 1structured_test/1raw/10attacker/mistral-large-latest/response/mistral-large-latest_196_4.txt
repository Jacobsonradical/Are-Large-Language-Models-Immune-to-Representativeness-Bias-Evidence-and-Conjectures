To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness is correct 80% of the time:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \)

The second witness is correct 70% of the time:
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

First, we calculate the joint probability \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \times P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate the marginal probability \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief:

\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
