To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(C|A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(C|\neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A|B \cap C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B \cap C|A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C|A) = P(B|A) \cdot P(C|A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B \cap C|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C|\neg A) = P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(C|\neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \cap C|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A|B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B \cap C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
