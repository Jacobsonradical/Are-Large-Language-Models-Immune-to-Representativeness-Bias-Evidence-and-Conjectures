To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses with the prior probability of the attacker's height.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (20% error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (30% error rate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (70% accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
