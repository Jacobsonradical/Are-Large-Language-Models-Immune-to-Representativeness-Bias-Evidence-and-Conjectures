To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), where \( W1 \) is the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( W2 \) is the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Calculating each term:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
