To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

For the witnesses:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and is wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1 | T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1 | \neg T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2 | T) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2 | \neg T) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T | W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}} \]
