To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(C|A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time).
- \( P(C|\neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

We want to find \( P(A|B,C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B,C) = \frac{P(B,C|A)P(A)}{P(B,C)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B,C|A) \) and \( P(B,C|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) \times P(C|A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(B,C|\neg A) = P(B|\neg A) \times P(C|\neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B,C) \):

\[ P(B,C) = P(B,C|A)P(A) + P(B,C|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B,C) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(B,C) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A|B,C) \):

\[ P(A|B,C) = \frac{P(B,C|A)P(A)}{P(B,C)} \]

\[ P(A|B,C) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(A|B,C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
