To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

For the witnesses:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 | T) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg T) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.20).

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W_1) \):
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
