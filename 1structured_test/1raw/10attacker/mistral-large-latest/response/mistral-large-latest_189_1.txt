To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the testimonies of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (probability that Witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (probability that Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (probability that Witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), where \( W1 \) is the testimony of Witness 1 and \( W2 \) is the testimony of Witness 2.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2|S) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
