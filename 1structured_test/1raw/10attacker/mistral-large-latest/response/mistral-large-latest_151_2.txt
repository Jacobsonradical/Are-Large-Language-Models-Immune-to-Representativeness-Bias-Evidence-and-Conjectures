To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods provided by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.2323}} \]
