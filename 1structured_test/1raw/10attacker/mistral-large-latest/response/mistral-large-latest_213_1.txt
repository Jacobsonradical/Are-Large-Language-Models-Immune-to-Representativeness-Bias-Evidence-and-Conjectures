To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with a 70% accuracy rate:
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]
