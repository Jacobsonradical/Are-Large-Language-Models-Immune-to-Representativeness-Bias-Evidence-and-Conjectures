To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to incorporate the witness testimonies and the population statistics.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \) (correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \) (incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W1, W2) \):

\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
