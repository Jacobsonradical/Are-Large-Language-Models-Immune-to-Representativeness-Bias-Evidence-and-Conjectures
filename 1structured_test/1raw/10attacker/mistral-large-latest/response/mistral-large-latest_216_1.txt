To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a tall person.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.70 = 0.56 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W1, W2|\neg T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.56 \cdot 0.15 + 0.06 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.622.

\[ \boxed {probability: 0.622} \]
