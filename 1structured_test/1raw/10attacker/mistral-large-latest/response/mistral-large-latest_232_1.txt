To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the base rate of the population's height with the accuracy of the witnesses' statements.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

Given the witnesses' accuracy:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so. This involves using Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T|W_1) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.
- \( P(W_1|T) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
