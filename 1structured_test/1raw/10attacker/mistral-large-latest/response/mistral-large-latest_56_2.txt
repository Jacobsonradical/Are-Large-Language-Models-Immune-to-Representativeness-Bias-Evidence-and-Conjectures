To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the base rate of the population's height with the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

For the witnesses:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 | T) \) is the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80%).
- \( P(W1) \) is the overall probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Given:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (since Witness 1 is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Calculating \( P(W1) \):
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
