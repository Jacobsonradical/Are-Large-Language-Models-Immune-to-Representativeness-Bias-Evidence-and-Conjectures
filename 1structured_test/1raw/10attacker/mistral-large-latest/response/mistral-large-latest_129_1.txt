To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(C | A) = 0.3 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B, C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B, C)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B, C | A) \) and \( P(B, C | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B, C | A) = P(B | A) \cdot P(C | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B, C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(C | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B, C) \):

\[ P(B, C) = P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B, C | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.155 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A | B, C) \):

\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B, C)} \]
\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B, C) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
