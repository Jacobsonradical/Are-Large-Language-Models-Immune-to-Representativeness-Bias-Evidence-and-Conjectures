To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(S|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(S|\neg T) = 0.20 \)

We want to find \( P(T|S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|S) = \frac{P(S|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(S)} \]

Where \( P(S) \) is the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(S) = P(S|T) \cdot P(T) + P(S|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(S) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(S) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(S) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|S) \):

\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|S) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
