To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods given by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' accuracies:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let \( W1 \) be the event that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W2 \) be the event that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \).

First, calculate the likelihoods:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 says taller given the attacker is taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 says taller given the attacker is shorter)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 says shorter given the attacker is taller)
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 says shorter given the attacker is shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) P(A)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \times P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \times P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of the witnesses' testimonies is:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | A) P(A) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, plug these into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{{probability: 0.232}}
}
\]
