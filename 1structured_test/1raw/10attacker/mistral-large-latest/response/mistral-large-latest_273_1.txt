To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses with the prior probability of the attacker's height.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}} \]
