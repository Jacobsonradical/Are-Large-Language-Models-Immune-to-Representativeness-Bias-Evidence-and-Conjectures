To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the population and the reliability of the witnesses' statements.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Witness reliability:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% or 0.80).
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20% or 0.20).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
