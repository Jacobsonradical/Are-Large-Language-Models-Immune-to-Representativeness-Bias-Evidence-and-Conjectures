To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy rate and a 20% error rate. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with a 70% accuracy rate and a 30% error rate.

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1|T) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80%).
- \( P(W1|S) \) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20%).

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
