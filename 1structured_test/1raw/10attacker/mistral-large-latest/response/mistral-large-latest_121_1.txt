To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods given by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg T) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|\neg T) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|\neg T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = P(W1|\neg T) \cdot P(W2|\neg T) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Calculating each term:
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{{probability: 0.232}}
}
\]
