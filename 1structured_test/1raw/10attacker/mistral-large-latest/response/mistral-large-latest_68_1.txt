To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.8 \) (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(C | A) = 0.3 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B \cap C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B \cap C | A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C | A) = P(B | A) \cdot P(C | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B \cap C | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B \cap C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(C | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B \cap C) \):

\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B \cap C | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A | B \cap C) \):

\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B \cap C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}} \]
