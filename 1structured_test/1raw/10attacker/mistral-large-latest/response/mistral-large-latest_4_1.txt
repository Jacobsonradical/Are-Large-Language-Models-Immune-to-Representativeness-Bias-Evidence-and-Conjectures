To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population and the accuracy of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, let's consider the witnesses' testimonies:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy.

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies.

Let:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \):

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \)
- \( P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \)

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
