To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Given \( P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \):

\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
