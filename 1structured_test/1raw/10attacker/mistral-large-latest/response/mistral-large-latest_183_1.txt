To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time).
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

We want to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.

\[
\boxed{
\text{{probability: 0.2323}}
}
\]
