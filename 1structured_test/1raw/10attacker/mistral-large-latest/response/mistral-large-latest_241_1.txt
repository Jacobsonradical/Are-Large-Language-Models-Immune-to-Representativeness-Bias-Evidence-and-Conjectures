To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this event as \( W1 \).

The probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80%, or \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \).

The probability that the first witness is wrong given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 20%, or \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update our belief about the attacker's height given the first witness's testimony:

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S)} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.4138}} \]
