To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses' testimonies and the population statistics.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \):
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
