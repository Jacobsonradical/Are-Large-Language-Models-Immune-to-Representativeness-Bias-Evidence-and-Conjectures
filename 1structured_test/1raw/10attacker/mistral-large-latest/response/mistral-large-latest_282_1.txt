To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods given by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}} \]
