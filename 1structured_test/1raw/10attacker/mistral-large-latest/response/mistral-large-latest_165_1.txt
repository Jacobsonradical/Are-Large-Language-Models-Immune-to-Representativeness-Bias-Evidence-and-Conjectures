To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B | A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(C | A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(C | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B, C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the claims of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B, C)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B, C | A) \):

\[ P(B, C | A) = P(B | A) \cdot P(C | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B, C | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B, C | \neg A) = P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(C | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B, C) \):

\[ P(B, C) = P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B, C | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A | B, C) \):

\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{P(B, C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B, C)} \]
\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B, C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]
