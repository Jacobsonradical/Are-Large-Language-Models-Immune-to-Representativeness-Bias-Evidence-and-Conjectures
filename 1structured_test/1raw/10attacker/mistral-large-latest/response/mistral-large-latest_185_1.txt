To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihoods given by the witnesses' testimonies.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (20% chance of incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (30% chance of incorrectly identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (70% chance of correctly identifying a shorter person)

We need to calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | A) \):

\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \):

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
