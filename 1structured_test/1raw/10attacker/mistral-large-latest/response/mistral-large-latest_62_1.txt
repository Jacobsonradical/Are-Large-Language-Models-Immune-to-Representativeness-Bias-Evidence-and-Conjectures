To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \{\text{probability}: 0.232\} \]
