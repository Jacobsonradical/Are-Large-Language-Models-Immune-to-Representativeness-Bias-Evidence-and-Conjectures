To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (P(S) = 0.85).
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (P(T) = 0.15).

Witness reliabilities:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80%).
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (20%).
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (30%).
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (70%).

We need to calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
