To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses and the population statistics.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (80% correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (20% error when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with:
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (70% correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (30% error when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(A | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \):

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{\text{{probability: 0.232}}} \]
