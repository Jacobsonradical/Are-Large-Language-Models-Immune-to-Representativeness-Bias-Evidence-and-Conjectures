To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \) (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \).

First, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \) and \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \times P(B_2 | A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \times P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.

\[ \{\text{probability: } 0.2323\} \]
