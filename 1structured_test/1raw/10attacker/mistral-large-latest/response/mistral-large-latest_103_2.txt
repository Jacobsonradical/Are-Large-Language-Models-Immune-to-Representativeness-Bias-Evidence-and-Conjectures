To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(C|A) = 0.3 \) (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(C|\neg A) = 0.7 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(A|B, C) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B, C) = \frac{P(B, C|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B, C)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B, C|A) \):

\[ P(B, C|A) = P(B|A) \cdot P(C|A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B, C|\neg A) \):

\[ P(B, C|\neg A) = P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(C|\neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B, C) \):

\[ P(B, C) = P(B, C|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B, C|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B, C) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A|B, C) \):

\[ P(A|B, C) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B, C) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|B, C) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
