To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the information provided by the witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person (80%).
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (20%).
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short person (70%).
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short (30%).

Given the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker is tall given the witnesses' statements. We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \) and \( P(W1, W2|S) \):

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
