To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = P(B_1 \cap B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(B_1 \cap B_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \):

\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
