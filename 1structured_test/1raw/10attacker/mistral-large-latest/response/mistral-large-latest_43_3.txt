To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses with the prior probability of the attacker's height.

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Witness 2:
- \( P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg A) = P(W1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1, W2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A | W1, W2) \):

\[ P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
