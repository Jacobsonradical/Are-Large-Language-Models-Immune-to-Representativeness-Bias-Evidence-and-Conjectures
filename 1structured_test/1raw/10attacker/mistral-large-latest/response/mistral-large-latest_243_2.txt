To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population and the reliability of the witnesses.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Calculating the components:

\[ P(W1, W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, plugging these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{{probability: 0.232}}
}
\]
