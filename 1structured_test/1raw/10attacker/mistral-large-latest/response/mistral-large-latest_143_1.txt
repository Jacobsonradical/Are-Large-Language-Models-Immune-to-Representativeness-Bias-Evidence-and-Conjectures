To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Now, let's consider the reliability of the witnesses:
- The first witness is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( W1_T \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_S \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_T \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the testimonies:
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( W1_T \)).
- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( W2_S \)).

We need to calculate \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \):
- \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is tall)
- \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \) (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is tall)

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \):
- \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \) (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is short)
- \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is short)

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1_T, W2_S) \):
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \):
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
