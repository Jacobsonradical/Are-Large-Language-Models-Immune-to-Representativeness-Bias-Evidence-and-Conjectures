To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \text{{probability: 0.232}} \]
