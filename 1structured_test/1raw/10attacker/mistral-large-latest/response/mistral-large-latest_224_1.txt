To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

We also have the reliability of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 says so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \boxed{0.4138} \]
