To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of the population's height and the reliability of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(T) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the reliability of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is wrong when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T|W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2|S) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]
