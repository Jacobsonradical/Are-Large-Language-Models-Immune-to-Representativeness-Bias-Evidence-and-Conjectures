To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the information from the witnesses with the base rates of heights in the population.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' reliabilities:
- Witness 1 (W1) claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
  - \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \) (correct 80% of the time)
  - \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (errs 20% of the time)
- Witness 2 (W2) claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
  - \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (correct 70% of the time)
  - \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \) (errs 30% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | H) \) and \( P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\boxed{
  \text{{probability: 0.232}}
}
\]
