Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **T:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

We need to find the following probabilities:

* **P(W1|T):** Probability the first witness claims taller given the attacker is taller (80% accuracy).
* **P(T):**  Prior probability that the attacker is taller (15% of the population).
* **P(W1):** Probability the first witness claims taller, regardless of the attacker's height.  We can find this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|~T) * P(~T) 
    * Where  ~T is the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**3. Calculations:**

* **P(W1|T) = 0.80** (Given)
* **P(T) = 0.15** (Given)
* **P(W1|~T) = 0.20** (Error rate of the first witness)
* **P(~T) = 0.85** (Complement of P(T))

Now, calculate P(W1):
* P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

* P(T|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
