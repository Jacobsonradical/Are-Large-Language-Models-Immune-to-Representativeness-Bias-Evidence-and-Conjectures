Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have conflicting information from two witnesses. We need to combine this information with the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (based on the city population) to arrive at a revised probability.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (based on the city population).

* **P(B):** The overall probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    Where:
    * P(B|not A): The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.48 or 48%. This is higher than the initial probability of 15% but still significantly less than a 50% chance.
