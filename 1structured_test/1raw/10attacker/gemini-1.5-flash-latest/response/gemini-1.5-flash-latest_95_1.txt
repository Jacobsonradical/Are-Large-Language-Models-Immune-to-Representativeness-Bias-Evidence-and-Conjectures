Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

1. **Population Statistics:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This represents the prior probability of someone being tall.
2. **Witness Testimony:** We have the accuracy rates of each witness. This information helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness statements.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief in light of new evidence. Let's define:

*  **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (from population statistics).
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming "tall." This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
