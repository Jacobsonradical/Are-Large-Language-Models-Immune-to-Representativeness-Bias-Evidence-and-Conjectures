Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Fact:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This means there's a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker was tall.
* **Witness 1:**  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they're wrong 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they're wrong 30% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.  Let:

*  A: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B: Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  ¬A: Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given Witness 1's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** Probability Witness 1 claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is tall, which is 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability Witness 1 claims "tall," which can happen in two ways:
    * Witness is correct (attacker is tall):  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness is wrong (attacker is short): P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
* **Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion**

Based on Witness 1's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 (or about 41.38%).
