Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

*  **P(A) = 0.15** (From information "a", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
*  **P(A') = 0.85** (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3.  Likelihoods**

*  **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are)
*  **P(B|A') = 0.20** (The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they are actually shorter)

**4.  Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]

**5.  Calculate**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
