Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Data:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us the prior probability of an attacker being taller or shorter.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with varying accuracy levels in judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies. Here's how it works:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability of the attacker being tall (A) given the first witness said they were tall (B). This is what we want to calculate.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness saying the attacker was tall given they actually were tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from population data).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness saying the attacker was tall.  This needs to be calculated considering both scenarios (attacker actually tall and actually short).

**Calculating P(B)**

* **P(B|A) * P(A):** Probability of witness saying tall AND attacker being tall = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **P(B|not A) * P(not A):** Probability of witness saying tall AND attacker being short = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
* **P(B):**  0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
