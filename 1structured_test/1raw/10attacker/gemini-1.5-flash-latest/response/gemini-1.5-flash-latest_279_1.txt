Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.

**2. Defining Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **¬A:** The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
* **¬B:** The first witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**3.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (From information "a")
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (From information "a")

**4.  Likelihoods (Based on witness accuracy)**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability of the first witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (Probability of the first witness saying "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter)

**5.  Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness said so. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**6. Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**7. Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
