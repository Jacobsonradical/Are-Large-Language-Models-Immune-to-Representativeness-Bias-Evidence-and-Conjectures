Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** We know the accuracy of each witness in identifying height.
* **Population Distribution:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm, given the conflicting witness testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is taller, given that they actually are taller (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is taller (15% from the population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is taller. This requires considering both cases: 
    * Witness 1 is correct:  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness 1 is wrong: P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the conflicting witness testimony and the population distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
