Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

Where:

* P(A|B1): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. (This is what we want to find)
* P(B1|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller (80% accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% from information 'a').
* P(B1): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller (we'll calculate this below).

**3. Calculate P(B1):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness is right and wrong:

* **Scenario 1: Witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller)**
    * Probability = P(A) * P(B1|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Witness is incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm)**
    * Probability = P(not A) * P(B1|not A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 

Therefore, P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
          = 0.12 / 0.29
          â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
