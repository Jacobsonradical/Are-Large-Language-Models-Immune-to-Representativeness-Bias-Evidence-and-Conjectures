Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness 1:**  80% accuracy in identifying height correctly, 20% error rate.
* **Witness 2:** 70% accuracy in identifying height correctly, 30% error rate.
* **Population:** 85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) given new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.80.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the population proportion, 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This needs to be calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): Probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (the witness's error rate, 0.20).
    * P(not A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
