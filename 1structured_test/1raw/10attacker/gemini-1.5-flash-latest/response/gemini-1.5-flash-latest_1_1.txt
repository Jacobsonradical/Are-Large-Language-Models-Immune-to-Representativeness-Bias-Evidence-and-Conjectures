Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that the attacker was tall.

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:** The likelihood of Witness 1 correctly identifying a tall person is 80%.
* **Witness 2:** The likelihood of Witness 2 correctly identifying a short person is 70%.

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witnesses' testimonies.  Let's define:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** The event that Witness 1 claims the attacker was tall.
* **W2:** The event that Witness 2 claims the attacker was short.

We want to find P(A | W1), the probability the attacker was tall given Witness 1's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Where:

* P(W1 | A) = 0.8 (The probability Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person)
* P(A) = 0.15 (Our prior probability of the attacker being tall)
* P(W1) =  The probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker was tall.

We need to calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | ~A) * P(~A) 

* P(W1 | ~A) = 0.2 (The probability Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
* P(~A) = 0.85 (The probability of the attacker being short)

Therefore:

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4.  Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
            = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness testimonies and the information about their accuracy, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
