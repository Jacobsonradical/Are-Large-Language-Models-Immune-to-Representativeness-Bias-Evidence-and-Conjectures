Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **General Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:**  80% accurate in identifying height, 20% error rate.
* **Witness 2:** 70% accurate in identifying height, 30% error rate.

**Logic**

We need to consider the probabilities of each scenario, given the witness testimonies:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is actually taller than 185 cm**
   * Witness 1 is likely to be correct (80% chance).
   * Witness 2 is likely to be wrong (30% chance).
2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm**
   * Witness 1 is likely to be wrong (20% chance).
   * Witness 2 is likely to be correct (70% chance).

**Calculating the Probability**

To find the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm, we need to consider the likelihood of each scenario happening and weigh it against the prior probability of a person being taller than 185 cm (15%):

* **Scenario 1:**  0.80 (Witness 1 accuracy) * 0.15 (prior probability of being taller) = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** 0.20 (Witness 1 error) * 0.85 (prior probability of being shorter) = 0.17

Now, we need to normalize these probabilities to get the overall probability of the attacker being taller:

* **Probability of attacker being taller:** 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = **0.41** (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.41}
