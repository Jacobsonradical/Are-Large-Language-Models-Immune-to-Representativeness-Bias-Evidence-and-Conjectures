Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (From statement "a")
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

**We need to calculate P(¬A) = 0.85** (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.29
```

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138 
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
