Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 0.15 (This is the proportion of the population taller than 185 cm from information "b")
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (This is the proportion of the population shorter than 185 cm)

**3.  Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was taller than 185 cm given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation**

Substitute the values we have:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
