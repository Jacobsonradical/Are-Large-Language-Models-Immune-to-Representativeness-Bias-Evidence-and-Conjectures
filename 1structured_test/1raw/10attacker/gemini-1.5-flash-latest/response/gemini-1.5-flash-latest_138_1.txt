Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (given in the information).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B1 | A) = 0.80:** The probability of the first witness claiming taller given the attacker is actually taller.
* **P(B1 | ¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the first witness claiming taller given the attacker is actually shorter.
* **P(B2 | A) = 0.20:** The probability of the second witness claiming shorter given the attacker is actually taller.
* **P(B2 | ¬A) = 0.70:** The probability of the second witness claiming shorter given the attacker is actually shorter.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A | B1), the probability the attacker was taller given the first witness's claim. 

Bayes' Theorem states: 
  P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), we use the law of total probability:
  P(B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A | B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
