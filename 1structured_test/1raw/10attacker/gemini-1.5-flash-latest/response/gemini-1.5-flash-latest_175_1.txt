Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Data:**  85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This represents the prior probability of an attacker being a certain height.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with varying accuracy in judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony). 

Let's define:

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *actually* is 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% from the population data.
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is a bit tricky and requires us to consider both scenarios (attacker is tall or short).

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *actually* shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
