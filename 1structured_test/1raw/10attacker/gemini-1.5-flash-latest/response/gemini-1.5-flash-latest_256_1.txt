Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the solution:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Given Information**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (First witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (First witness incorrectly identifies taller people 20% of the time)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.70** (Second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)
* **P(C|A) = 0.30** (Second witness incorrectly identifies shorter people 30% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.34

**4. Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353

**Answer:** {probability: 0.353}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.353.**
