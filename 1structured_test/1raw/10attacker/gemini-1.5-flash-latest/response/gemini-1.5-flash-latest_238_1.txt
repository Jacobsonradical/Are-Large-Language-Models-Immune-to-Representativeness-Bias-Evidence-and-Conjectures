Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller (from the population data) = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability witness 1 claims "taller" given the attacker was actually taller = 0.80 (accuracy of witness 1)
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability witness 1 claims "taller" given the attacker was actually shorter = 0.20 (error rate of witness 1)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the attacker's height (event A) given the new evidence from the witness (event B):

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)] 
```

**5. Calculation**

Plug in the values:

```
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.34
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.353.**
