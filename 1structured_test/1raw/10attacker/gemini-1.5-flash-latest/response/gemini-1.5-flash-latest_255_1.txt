Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  **P(A):** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the information).
*  **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (1 - 0.15).

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller, given the attacker *was* taller, is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
*  **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller, given the attacker *was* shorter, is 0.2 (20% error rate).

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4615.**
