Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let W1 be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let W2 be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(W1|A):**  The probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker *is* taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 15% (from the population information).
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness saying "taller". This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|W1):**

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
