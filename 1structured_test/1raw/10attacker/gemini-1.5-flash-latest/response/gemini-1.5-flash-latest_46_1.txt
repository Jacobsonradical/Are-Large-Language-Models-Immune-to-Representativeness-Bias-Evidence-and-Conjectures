Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the probability estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information in "b" tells us that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Accuracy:** The information in "a" gives us the accuracy rates of each witness. We need to consider how this accuracy impacts our estimate. 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior probability based on new evidence (the witness testimony). It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening (our prior probability).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**Applying the Formula**

* **P(A):**  0.15 (prior probability from information "b")
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is taller)
* **P(B|¬A):** 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)
* **P(¬A):** 0.85 (the probability the attacker is shorter, from information "b")

We need to find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
