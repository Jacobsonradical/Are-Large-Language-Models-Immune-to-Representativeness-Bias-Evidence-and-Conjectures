Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall person (given in the problem).
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (given in the problem).

**We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
```

**Let's break down the calculation:**

* **P(not A) = 0.85:** The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.

**Now, substitute the values into the equation:**

```
P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
       = 0.12 / 0.30
       = 0.4 
```

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.4.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4}
