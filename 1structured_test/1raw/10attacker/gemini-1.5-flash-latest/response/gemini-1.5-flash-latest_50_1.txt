Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two competing pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** One witness claims the attacker was tall (185 cm or taller), and another claims the attacker was short (shorter than 185 cm).
* **Population Statistics:** The city's population has a higher percentage of shorter individuals.

We need to weigh these pieces of information to determine the probability that the attacker was actually tall.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. It looks like this:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case, this is the probability the attacker is tall, given the witness testimony.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.  This is the probability the witness would say "tall" given that the attacker is actually tall.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of event A. This is the probability the attacker is tall based on the population statistics.
* **P(B):** The probability of event B. This is the probability of the witness saying "tall" (which can happen whether the attacker is actually tall or short).

**Calculations**

1. **Define Events:**
   * A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
   * B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

2. **Gather Probabilities:**
   * P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is taller than 185 cm)
   * P(B|A) = 0.80 (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
   * P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

3. **Calculate P(B):**
   * We need the probability of the witness saying "tall" regardless of the actual height. We can use the law of total probability:
     * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
   * P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, there is approximately a 41% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.
