Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  This is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, given from information "a": P(A) = 0.15

* **P(¬A):** The probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm: P(¬A) = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods**

These are the probabilities of the witness's observation given the actual height:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person IS taller: P(B|A) = 0.80 (from information "b")

* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person IS NOT taller: P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from information "b")

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
