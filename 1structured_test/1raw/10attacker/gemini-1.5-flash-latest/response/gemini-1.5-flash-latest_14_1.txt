Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is actually taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is actually shorter)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.7** (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is actually shorter)
* **P(C|A) = 0.3** (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is actually taller)

**4.  Using Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

To calculate P(B), we need the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**
* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
