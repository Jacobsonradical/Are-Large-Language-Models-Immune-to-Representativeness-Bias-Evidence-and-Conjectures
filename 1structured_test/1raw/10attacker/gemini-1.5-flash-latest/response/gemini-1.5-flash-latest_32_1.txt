Here's how we can break down the problem and estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Population Data:**  85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** 
    * Witness 1: Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller (80% accurate, 20% error).
    * Witness 2: Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (70% accurate, 30% error).

**Reasoning:**

We need to consider the accuracy of the witnesses in the context of the population data.  

* **Witness 1's claim is more likely if:**  The attacker was actually tall (185 cm or taller). This is because they are more accurate at identifying tall people.
* **Witness 1's claim is less likely if:** The attacker was actually short. This is because they have a higher chance of making a mistake.

**Calculation:**

1. **Base Probability:** The base probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (based on population data).

2. **Witness 1's Accuracy:** Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when someone is actually tall.

3. **Combined Probability:** We need to consider both the base probability and the witness's accuracy. Since we don't know the actual attacker's height, we can't directly apply the 80% accuracy. However, we can use a weighted average. 

4. **Weighted Average:** 
   *  Probability of attacker being tall * witness accuracy for tall people = (0.15) * (0.80) = 0.12
   * Probability of attacker being short * witness error for tall people = (0.85) * (0.20) = 0.17

5. **Final Estimate:** To get the overall probability that the attacker was tall, we can divide the probability of a correct identification (0.12) by the sum of the probabilities of both possible outcomes (0.12 + 0.17): 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
