Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**3. Calculate Components:**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.429

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
