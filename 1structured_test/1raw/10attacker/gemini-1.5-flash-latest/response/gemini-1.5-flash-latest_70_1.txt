Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  Two witnesses provide conflicting information about the attacker's height. We know their accuracy rates.
* **Population Statistics:**  We know the proportion of the population that is taller or shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This is a classic example where Bayes' Theorem can help us. Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find  P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is tall, which is the proportion of the population taller than 185 cm, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):**  The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): The probability the witness claims tall given the attacker is *not* tall (i.e., shorter than 185 cm). This is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The prior probability the attacker is not tall, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.48 or 48%.**
