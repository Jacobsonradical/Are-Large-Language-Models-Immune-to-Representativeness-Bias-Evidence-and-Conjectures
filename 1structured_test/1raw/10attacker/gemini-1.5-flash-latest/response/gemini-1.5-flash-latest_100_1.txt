Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given they actually are tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given they are actually short (20% error).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% of the population).
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of the attacker being short (85% of the population).

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
