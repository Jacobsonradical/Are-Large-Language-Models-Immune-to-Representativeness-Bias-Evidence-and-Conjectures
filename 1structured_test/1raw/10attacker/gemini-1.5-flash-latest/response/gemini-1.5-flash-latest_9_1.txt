Here's how we can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B1|A):** The probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population.
* **P(B1):** The probability of Witness 1 making their claim. We can find this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
