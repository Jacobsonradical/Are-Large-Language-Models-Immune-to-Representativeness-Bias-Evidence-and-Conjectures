Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Population Data:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with varying accuracy levels.  

**Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence.

Let's define the following events:

*  **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Breaking Down the Components**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on the city's population data.
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A) = 20% (0.2) - the witness's error rate when the attacker is short.
    * P(not A) = 85% (0.85) - the proportion of people shorter than 185 cm.

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the first witness's claim and the information we have, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 (or 48%).
