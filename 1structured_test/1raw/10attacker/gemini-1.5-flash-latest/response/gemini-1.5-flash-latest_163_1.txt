Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  Witness 1 says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and Witness 2 says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We know their accuracy rates.
* **Population Statistics:**  The city's population has a known distribution of heights (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller).

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's testimony. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is tall. This is the city's population distribution, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall (regardless of the attacker's actual height). We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's testimony, is approximately 41.4%. While Witness 1 is generally accurate, the fact that a majority of the population is shorter than 185 cm makes this estimate less certain.
