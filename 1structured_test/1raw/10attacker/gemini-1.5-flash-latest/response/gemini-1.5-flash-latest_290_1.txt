Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:**  85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability:**
    * Witness 1 (claims taller): 80% accuracy, 20% error.
    * Witness 2 (claims shorter): 70% accuracy, 30% error.

**2.  Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability Witness 1 claims "taller" given the attacker IS tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we need to consider all ways Witness 1 could claim "taller":

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker IS tall, and Witness 1 is correct (P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker IS short, and Witness 1 is wrong (P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

P(B) = Scenario 1 + Scenario 2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
