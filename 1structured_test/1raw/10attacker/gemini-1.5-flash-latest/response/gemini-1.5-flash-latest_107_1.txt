Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let  'T' represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let 'S' represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let 'W1' represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
*  Let 'W2' represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

*  P(T) = 0.15 (From the given information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
*  P(S) = 0.85 (From the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time)
* P(W2 | S) = 0.70 (The second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)
* P(W2 | T) = 0.30 (The second witness incorrectly identifies taller people as shorter 30% of the time)

**4.  Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability that the attacker is taller given the first witness's statement. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the Law of Total Probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
      = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
      = 0.31

**5. Calculate P(T | W1)**

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.31
          = 0.3871 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.3871}
