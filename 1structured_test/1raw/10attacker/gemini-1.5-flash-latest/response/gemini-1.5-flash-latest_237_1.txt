Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony. We start with the prior probability (based on the city's population) and then incorporate the likelihoods provided by the witnesses' accuracy.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to calculate)
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened (witness accuracy)
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A (population distribution)
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening (can be calculated using the law of total probability)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to Our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually was shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**Calculating P(B) using the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
