Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness testimonies.  

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. 
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **B:** First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

**Gathering Information from the Problem**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being tall is 15% (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):**  The probability of the first witness claiming "tall" given the attacker is actually tall is 80% (accuracy of the first witness).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming "tall" given the attacker is actually short is 20% (error rate of the first witness).
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of the attacker being short is 85% (given in the problem).

**Calculating P(B):**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker is tall and the attacker is short.

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is tall**
    * P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is short**
    * P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17
* **Total Probability of Witness Claiming "Tall":**  0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
