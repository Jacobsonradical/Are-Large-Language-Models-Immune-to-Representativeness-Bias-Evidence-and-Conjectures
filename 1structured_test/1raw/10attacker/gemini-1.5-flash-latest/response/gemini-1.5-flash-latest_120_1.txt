Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**3. Calculate Components**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually taller is 0.8 (given in the problem).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming "taller" can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28 

**4. Calculate P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4286}
