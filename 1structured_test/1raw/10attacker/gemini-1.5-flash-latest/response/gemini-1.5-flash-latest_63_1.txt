Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.**

**We know the following from the information provided:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* **P(B|~A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies taller people 20% of the time)
* **P(C|A) = 0.20** (The second witness incorrectly identifies taller people 20% of the time)
* **P(C|~A) = 0.70** (The second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)

**We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now, we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
