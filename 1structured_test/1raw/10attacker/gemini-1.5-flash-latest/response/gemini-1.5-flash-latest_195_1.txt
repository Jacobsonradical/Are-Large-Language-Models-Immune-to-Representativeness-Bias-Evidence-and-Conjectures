Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city population, is 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Conditional Probabilities (Likelihoods)**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller given that they were actually taller is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller given that they were actually shorter is 0.2 (20% error).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of the attacker being taller given the witness's testimony:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

where P(B) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller, calculated as follows:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
```

**5. Calculation**

Let's plug in the values:

```
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

```
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**
