Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Understanding the Prior Probability**

* We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability of the attacker being tall.

**2. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker being tall) based on new evidence (witness testimonies).  

* Let 'T' represent the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller)
* Let 'S' represent the attacker being short (shorter than 185 cm)
* Let 'W1' represent the first witness claiming the attacker was tall
* Let 'W2' represent the second witness claiming the attacker was short

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):** Probability of the first witness claiming tall given the attacker was tall. This is the accuracy of the first witness for tall people, which is 80%.
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 0.15.
* **P(W1):** Probability of the first witness claiming tall, regardless of the attacker's actual height.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|S) * P(S)
    * P(W1|S) is the probability of the first witness claiming tall given the attacker was short (which is 20% or 0.2)
    * P(S) is the prior probability of the attacker being short, which is 0.85

**3. Calculation**

* P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
