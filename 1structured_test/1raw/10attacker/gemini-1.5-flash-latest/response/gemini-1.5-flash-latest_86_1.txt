Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claimed so (what we want to find).
* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller (80% accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% from the population data).
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (20% error rate).
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (85% from population data).

**4. Substitute and Calculate:**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, plug all the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.4138}
