Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that the attacker was tall.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1 (Tall):**  The first witness correctly identified someone as tall 80% of the time. 
* **Witness 1 (Short):** The first witness incorrectly identified someone as tall 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2 (Tall):** The second witness correctly identified someone as tall 30% of the time (since they claimed the attacker was short).
* **Witness 2 (Short):** The second witness incorrectly identified someone as tall 70% of the time. 

**3. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior probability based on new evidence (the witness statements).  Here's how we can apply it:

Let:

*  A = The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
*  B = The event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = The probability of the first witness saying "tall" given the attacker was actually tall (0.8 from the likelihoods).
* P(A) = The prior probability the attacker was tall (0.15).
* P(B) = The probability of the first witness saying "tall", which can happen in two ways:
    * The attacker was actually tall (0.8 * 0.15)
    * The attacker was actually short (0.2 * 0.85) 

**4. Calculation**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
