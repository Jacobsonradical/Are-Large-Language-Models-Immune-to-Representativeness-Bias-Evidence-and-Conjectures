Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of two witnesses.  We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness evidence.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Let's break down the components:**

* **P(B|A):**  Probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall.  This is the first witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is the base rate in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):**  Probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall. This requires considering both scenarios (attacker tall and attacker short): 
    *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.43 or 43%.**
