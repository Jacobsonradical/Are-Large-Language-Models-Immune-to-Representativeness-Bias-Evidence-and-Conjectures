Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B|not A): The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 85% or 0.85.

**4. Calculate P(B):**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
