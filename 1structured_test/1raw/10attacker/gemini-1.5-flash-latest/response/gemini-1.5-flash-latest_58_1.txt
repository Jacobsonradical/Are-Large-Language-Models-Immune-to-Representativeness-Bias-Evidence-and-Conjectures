Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
* P(B|A): Probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the city population statistic).
* P(B): Probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we'll calculate this later).

**3. Gather Information from the Problem:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is tall)

**4. Calculate P(B):**

To get P(B), we need the probability of the witness claiming "tall" in both scenarios (attacker is tall and attacker is short):

* P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 (witness claims "tall" when attacker is actually tall)
* P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 (witness claims "tall" when attacker is actually short)

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate is that there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.**
