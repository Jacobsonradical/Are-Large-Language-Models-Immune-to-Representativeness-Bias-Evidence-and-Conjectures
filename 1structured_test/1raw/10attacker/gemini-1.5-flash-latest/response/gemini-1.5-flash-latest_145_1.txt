Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "T" represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "F" represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* Let "W1T" represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W1F" represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* Let "W2T" represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W2F" represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T | W1T), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness claimed so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1T) = [P(W1T | T) * P(T)] / P(W1T)

* **P(W1T | T):**  The probability the first witness claims tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is the proportion of the population that is tall, given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1T):** The probability of the first witness claiming tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1T) = P(W1T | T) * P(T) + P(W1T | F) * P(F)
    * P(W1T) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**3. Calculate the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1T) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
