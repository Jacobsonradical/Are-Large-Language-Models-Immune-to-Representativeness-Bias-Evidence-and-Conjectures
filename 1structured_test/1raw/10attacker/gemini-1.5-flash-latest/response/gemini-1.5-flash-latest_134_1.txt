Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.

**Setting up the Variables**

* **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (given by the population data: 0.15).
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.8).
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2).
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (1 - 0.15 = 0.85).

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Calculation**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.31
P(A|B) ≈ 0.387

**Answer**

{probability: 0.387}
