Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability of the attacker being tall.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:** 
    *  Probability of correctly identifying a tall person: 80% (true positive)
    *  Probability of incorrectly identifying a short person as tall: 20% (false positive)
* **Witness 2:**
    * Probability of correctly identifying a short person: 70% (true negative)
    * Probability of incorrectly identifying a tall person as short: 30% (false negative)

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witnesses' testimony.  Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1's claim. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A) = Probability of Witness 1 claiming tall given the attacker is actually tall (true positive) = 0.8
* P(A) = Prior probability of attacker being tall = 0.15
* P(B) =  Probability of Witness 1 claiming tall (this requires the law of total probability):
    *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%. This is higher than the prior probability (15%) but still suggests that it's more likely the attacker was shorter.
