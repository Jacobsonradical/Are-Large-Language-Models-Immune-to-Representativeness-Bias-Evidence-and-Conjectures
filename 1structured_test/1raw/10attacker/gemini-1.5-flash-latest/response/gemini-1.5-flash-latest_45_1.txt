Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the information about the city's population).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they actually are tall is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they are actually short is 0.2 (20% error).

**We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
```

**Let's break down the calculation:**

* **P(B|A) * P(A):** 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 
* **P(B|not A) * P(not A):** 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Putting it all together:**

```
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.41.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
