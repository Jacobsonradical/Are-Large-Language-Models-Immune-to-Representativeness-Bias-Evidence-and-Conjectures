Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (First witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (First witness incorrectly identifies taller people 20% of the time)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.70** (Second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)
* **P(C|A) = 0.30** (Second witness incorrectly identifies shorter people 30% of the time)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**To find P(B), we need to consider all possible ways the first witness could claim the attacker is taller:**

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.31
```

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.31
       = 0.3871 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.3871}
