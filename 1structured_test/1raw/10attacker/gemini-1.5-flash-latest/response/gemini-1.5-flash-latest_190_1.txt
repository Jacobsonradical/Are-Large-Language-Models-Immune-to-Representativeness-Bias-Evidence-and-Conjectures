Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to calculate P(¬A), the probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:

* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can plug all the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
