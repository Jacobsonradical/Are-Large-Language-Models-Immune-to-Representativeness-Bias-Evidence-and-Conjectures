Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Population Data:**  15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:**  We have two witnesses with varying accuracy rates. We need to combine this with the population data to update our probability.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is the ideal tool for updating our belief based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (our target probability)
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened
* P(A): Prior probability of event A happening
* P(B): Probability of event B happening

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's plug in the values:

* P(A): 0.15 (Prior probability based on population data)
* P(B|A): 0.8 (Witness 1 correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* P(B|¬A): 0.2 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time) 
* P(¬A): 0.85 (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
