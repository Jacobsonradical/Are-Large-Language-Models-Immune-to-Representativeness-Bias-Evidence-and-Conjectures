Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We know their accuracy rates.
* **Population Distribution:**  85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony. We can use Bayes' Theorem for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the first witness's testimony (B). This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller (which is the witness's accuracy rate: 80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the population distribution: 15%).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|A):**  80% (as stated above)
* **P(A):** 15%
* **P(B|not A):** 20% (the probability of the witness incorrectly claiming tall when the attacker is short)
* **P(not A):** 85% (the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4615.**
