Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Understand the Prior Probability**

* We know 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, the probability of the attacker being tall before considering the witnesses' testimonies.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence (the witness testimonies).  It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of event A (attacker being tall) given event B (witness testimony). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of the witness giving a specific testimony given the attacker is tall.
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being tall (15%).
* P(B): The probability of the witness giving that specific testimony (we'll calculate this below).

**3. Calculate the Probability of Each Testimony**

* **First Witness (claims tall):** 
    *  P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% chance of identifying correctly)
    *  P(B|not A) = 0.2 (20% chance of getting it wrong)
    *  P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
* **Second Witness (claims short):**
    * P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% chance of getting it wrong)
    * P(B|not A) = 0.7 (70% chance of identifying correctly)
    * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.2 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85) = 0.655

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem for the First Witness**

P(attacker tall | first witness claims tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:** 

Based on the witness testimonies and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414. This means it's slightly more likely than not that the first witness is correct. However, it's important to remember that this is just an estimate and there is still a significant chance that the attacker was shorter.
