Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability of the attacker being tall.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:**  80% accuracy in identifying the correct height (tall or short).
* **Witness 2:** 70% accuracy in identifying the correct height.

**3. Bayesian Reasoning:**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimonies.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened (witness accuracy)
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A (attacker being tall)
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening (the witness making a certain claim)

**Let's define our events:**

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B1: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B2: Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find:**

* P(A|B1) - The probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1 claims they are tall.

**Calculating P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all the ways Witness 1 could make their claim:

* **Witness 1 is correct:**  P(B1|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 
* **Witness 1 is wrong:** P(B1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.
