Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of an individual being 185 cm or taller in the city.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability of an individual being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
