Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let **T** represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let **S** represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let **W1** represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let **W2** represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):**  The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being taller. This is the population proportion of people taller than 185 cm, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** The probability the first witness claims "taller". We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|S) * P(S)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**3. Calculate the Probability**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
