Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

* **P(A|W1):**  The probability we want to find – the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
* **P(W1|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they actually are – this is the accuracy of the first witness, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the population proportion of 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This requires us to consider both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller (A)
        * P(W1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 
    * **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A)
        * P(W1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 

    * **P(W1) =** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**3. Calculate the Probability:**

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
