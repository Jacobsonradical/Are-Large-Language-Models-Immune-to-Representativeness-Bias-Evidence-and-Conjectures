Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Data:** We know 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with varying accuracy rates.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.  

Let:

* **A:**  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** Event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

**Breaking down the terms:**

* **P(B1|A):** Probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15%).
* **P(B1):**  Overall probability of the first witness claiming "tall". This requires the law of total probability: 
    * P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B1|not A) = 20% (error rate of the first witness)
    * P(not A) = 85% (probability of the attacker being shorter)

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B1):** (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
2. **P(A|B1):** (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 41.4%.  While the witness's testimony increases the probability from the initial 15%, it's still not a conclusive result.
