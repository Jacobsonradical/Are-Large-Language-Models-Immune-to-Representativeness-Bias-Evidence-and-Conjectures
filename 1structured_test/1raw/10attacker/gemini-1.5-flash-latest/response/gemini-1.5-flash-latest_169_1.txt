Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the witness testimonies.  This is a conditional probability problem.

**Terminology**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony.**

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is the population proportion: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness claims "tall."  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is *not* tall. This is the witness's error rate: 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not A):** The probability the attacker is *not* tall, which is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48}
