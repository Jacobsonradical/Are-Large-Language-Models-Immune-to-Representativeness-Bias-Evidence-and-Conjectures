Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population distribution.  This is given as 0.15 (15%).

* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85%).

**3.  Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker was tall, given they actually were tall. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 0.80 (80%).

* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker was tall, given they were actually short. This is the witness's error rate, given as 0.20 (20%).

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

Where P(B) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker was tall, which can be calculated as:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.31
```

**5. Calculate the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.31 
       = 0.387 
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.387} 

**Interpretation:**

There is approximately a 38.7% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.
