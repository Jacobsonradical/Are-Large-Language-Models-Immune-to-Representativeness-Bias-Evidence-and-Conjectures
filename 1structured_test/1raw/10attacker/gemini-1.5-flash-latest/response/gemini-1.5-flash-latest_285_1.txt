Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have conflicting eyewitness testimony and prior knowledge about the height distribution in the population.  We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' statements.

**Let's Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8). 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on the population distribution.
* **P(B):** The overall probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is approximately 46.15%.
