Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city would be 185 cm or taller.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:** 80% accuracy in identifying the correct height (185 cm or taller in this case).
* **Witness 2:** 70% accuracy in identifying the correct height (shorter than 185 cm in this case).

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event:** Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's use the following notation:

*  P(T) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (our prior)
*  P(W1 | T) = Probability of Witness 1 claiming taller given the attacker is actually taller (likelihood)
*  P(W1 | ~T) = Probability of Witness 1 claiming taller given the attacker is actually shorter (likelihood)
*  P(~T) = Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (1 - P(T))
*  P(T | W1) = Probability of the attacker being taller given Witness 1 claimed so (what we want to calculate)

Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / [P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | ~T) * P(~T)]

**Calculations:**

* P(T) = 0.15
* P(~T) = 0.85
* P(W1 | T) = 0.80
* P(W1 | ~T) = 0.20 (since Witness 1 has a 20% chance of error)

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(T | W1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(T | W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:** 

Given Witness 1's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.414 or 41.4%.
