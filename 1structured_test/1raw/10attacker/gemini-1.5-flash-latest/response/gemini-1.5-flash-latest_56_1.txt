Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of an attacker being tall (from the population distribution).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone tall as tall.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone short as tall.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being short.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Let's plug in our values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
