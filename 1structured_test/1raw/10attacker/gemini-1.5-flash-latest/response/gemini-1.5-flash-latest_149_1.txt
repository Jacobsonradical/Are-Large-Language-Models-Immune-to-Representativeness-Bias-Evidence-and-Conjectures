Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of conflicting evidence:

* **Witness 1:** Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy rate.
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy rate.

We also know the base rate of heights in the population:

* **Base Rate:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimonies). Here's how we can apply it:

1. **Define Events:**

   *  A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   *  B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   *  C: Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Probabilities:**

   * P(A) = 0.15 (Base rate of taller people)
   * P(¬A) = 0.85 (Base rate of shorter people)
   * P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability of Witness 1 being correct given the attacker is taller)
   * P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (Probability of Witness 1 being wrong given the attacker is shorter)
   * P(C|A) = 0.20 (Probability of Witness 2 being wrong given the attacker is taller)
   * P(C|¬A) = 0.70 (Probability of Witness 2 being correct given the attacker is shorter)

3. **Bayes' Theorem:** We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller given Witness 1's claim.

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

   P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]

   P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 or 41%.  Even though Witness 1 has a higher accuracy rate, the base rate of taller people in the population being lower significantly influences the final probability.
