Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that the attacker is tall.

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1 (claimed tall):** 
    *  Correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time.
    *  Incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2 (claimed short):** 
    *  Correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time.
    *  Incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time.

**3.  Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimony. Let's define:

*  A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1's testimony. 
* P(B|A) = Probability Witness 1 claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall (0.8).
* P(A) = Prior probability the attacker is tall (0.15).
* P(B) = Probability Witness 1 claims "tall" (we need to calculate this).

**4. Calculate P(B):**

To get P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is tall (A):**  P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is short (not A):** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, based on the witness testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
