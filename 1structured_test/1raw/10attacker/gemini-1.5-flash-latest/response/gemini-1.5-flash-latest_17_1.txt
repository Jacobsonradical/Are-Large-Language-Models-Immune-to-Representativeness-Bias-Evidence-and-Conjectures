Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (From information "b", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (Based on witness accuracy):**

* **P(B1|A) = 0.8** (Witness 1 correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm 80% of the time)
* **P(B1|¬A) = 0.2** (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
* **P(B2|A) = 0.2** (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone taller than 185 cm 30% of the time)
* **P(B2|¬A) = 0.7** (Witness 2 correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker was taller than 185 cm given Witness 1's claim.

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

**P(A|B1) ≈ 0.41**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41}
