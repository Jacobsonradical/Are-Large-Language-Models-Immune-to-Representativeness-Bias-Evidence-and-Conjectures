Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **General population:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness testimony:** We need to combine the witness accuracy with the general population information.

**Calculations**

1. **First witness's accuracy:** The first witness correctly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. 
2. **First witness's error:**  The first witness incorrectly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the first witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the general population information).
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.414.**
