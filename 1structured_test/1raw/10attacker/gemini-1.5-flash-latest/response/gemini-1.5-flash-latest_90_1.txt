Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:**  The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. (This is what we want to find)
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they actually are. (From the information, this is 80%)
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from the information, this is 15%)
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter. (From the information, this is 20%)
* P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (from the information, this is 85%)

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4.  Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
