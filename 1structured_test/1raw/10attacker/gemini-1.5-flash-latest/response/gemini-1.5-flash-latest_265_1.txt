Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** From information "a", the probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** The probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Based on Witness Accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller is 0.80 (from information "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter is 0.20 (from information "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculations:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
