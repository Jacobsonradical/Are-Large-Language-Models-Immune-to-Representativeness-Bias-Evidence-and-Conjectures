Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two conflicting pieces of information:

* **Witness 1:**  Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and is accurate 80% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and is accurate 70% of the time.
* **Population Data:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm, given these facts.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence. In this case, our event is the attacker's height, and our evidence is the witness statements.

Let's define the following events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as taller than 185 cm when they actually are (given by the witness' accuracy) = 0.8
* **P(A):** The prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller (based on population data) = 0.15
* **P(B):** The overall probability that Witness 1 claims someone is taller than 185 cm. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   *  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's statement, is approximately 0.414, or about 41.4%. This means that even though Witness 1 claimed the attacker was taller, the prior probability of being taller in the population and the witness's error rate significantly reduce the overall likelihood of the attacker being taller.
