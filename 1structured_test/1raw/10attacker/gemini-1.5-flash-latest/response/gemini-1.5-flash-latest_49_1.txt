Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** The probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller (from information "b") = 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** The probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

**3.  Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person is actually taller (from information "a") = 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person is actually shorter (from information "a") = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find  **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is taller given the first witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] 
          = 0.12 / 0.30
          = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
