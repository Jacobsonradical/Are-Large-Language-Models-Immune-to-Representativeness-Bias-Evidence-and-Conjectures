Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Prior Probability:** The city's population distribution tells us the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two pieces of evidence:
    * Witness 1: Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy rate.
    * Witness 2: Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy rate.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness testimonies).

Let's define:

*  A: Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  B1: Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  B2: Event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B1|A):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually taller (this is the witness's accuracy, 0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller (0.15).
* **P(B1):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller," which can happen in two ways:
    *  The attacker is taller, and the witness is correct: P(B1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    *  The attacker is shorter, and the witness is wrong: P(B1|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability:**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
