Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two conflicting pieces of information:

* **Prior Information:** The general population distribution tells us there's a 15% chance the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:**  We have two witnesses with varying accuracy in judging height.

We need to combine these pieces to get a more informed estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let:

*  A:  Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  W1: Event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  W2: Event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given witness 1's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|A):** Probability witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
* **P(W1):** Probability of witness 1 making the claim (regardless of the attacker's height).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now, plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given witness 1's testimony, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller increases from the prior probability of 15% to about 41.4%. This reflects the influence of witness 1's relatively strong accuracy in judging height.
