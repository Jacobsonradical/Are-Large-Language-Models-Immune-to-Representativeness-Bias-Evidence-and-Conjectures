Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Information from the Problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)

**3.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**4.  Calculate:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
