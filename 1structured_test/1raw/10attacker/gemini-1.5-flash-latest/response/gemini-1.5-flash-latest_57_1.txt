Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**Information provided:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city.
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the city.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Let's plug in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
