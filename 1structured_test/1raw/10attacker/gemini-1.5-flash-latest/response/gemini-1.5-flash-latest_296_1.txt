Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies. 

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller (15%)
* **Likelihood:** The probability of each witness giving their testimony given the attacker's height.
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

**Calculations**

Let's define some events:

*  A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  B: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  W1: Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
*  W2: Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find P(A|W1) - the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given witness 1's testimony.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down the components:

* **P(W1|A):**  Probability of witness 1 saying "taller" given the attacker is actually taller (80% accuracy)
* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being taller (15%)
* **P(W1):**  Probability of witness 1 saying "taller" (we need to calculate this)

**Calculating P(W1):**

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B)

* **P(W1|B):** Probability of witness 1 saying "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter (20% error)
* **P(B):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter (85%)

P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it together:**

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
