Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that the attacker was tall.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1 (Claims Tall):** 
    *  Correctly identifies tall person: 80%
    *  Incorrectly identifies short person as tall: 20%
* **Witness 2 (Claims Short):**
    *  Correctly identifies short person: 70%
    *  Incorrectly identifies tall person as short: 30%

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony:

```
P(Tall | Witness 1) = [P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness 1)
```

Where:

* **P(Tall | Witness 1):**  Probability the attacker was tall given Witness 1's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness 1 | Tall):**  Probability of Witness 1 saying "tall" given the attacker was actually tall (80%).
* **P(Tall):**  Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15%).
* **P(Witness 1):**  Overall probability of Witness 1 saying "tall".  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**4. Calculating P(Witness 1):**

```
P(Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness 1 | Short) * P(Short)
```

*  P(Witness 1 | Tall) = 0.80
*  P(Tall) = 0.15
*  P(Witness 1 | Short) = 0.20 (The chance Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
*  P(Short) = 0.85 (The chance of someone being shorter than 185 cm)

Therefore:

```
P(Witness 1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**5. Putting it all together:**

```
P(Tall | Witness 1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.41
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.41. This means there's a slightly higher than 40% chance the attacker was tall, but it's still not a strong probability.
