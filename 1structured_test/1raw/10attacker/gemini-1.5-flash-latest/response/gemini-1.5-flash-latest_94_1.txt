Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. From the given information, **P(A) = 0.15**
* **P(¬A):** The probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.  **P(¬A) = 0.85**

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.  This is the witness's accuracy, **P(B|A) = 0.80** 
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, **P(B|¬A) = 0.20**

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness's claim:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
