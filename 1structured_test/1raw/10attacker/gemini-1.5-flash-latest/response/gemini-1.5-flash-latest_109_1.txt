Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (From information "b", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (The complement of A, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (The first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) ≈ 0.419

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.419.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.419}
