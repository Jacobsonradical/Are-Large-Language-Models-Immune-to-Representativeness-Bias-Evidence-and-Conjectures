Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony.

Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker *actually* is 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 from the population data.
* **P(B):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This requires considering both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller:**  Probability = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm:** Probability = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * **P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now, we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
