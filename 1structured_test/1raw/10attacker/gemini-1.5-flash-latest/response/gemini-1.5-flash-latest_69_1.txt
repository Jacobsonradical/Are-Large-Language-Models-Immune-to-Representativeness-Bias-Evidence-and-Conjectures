Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let "T" represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "W1" represent the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (T) given evidence (W1):

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Where:

* P(T|W1) = Probability the attacker was tall, given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(W1|T) = Probability the first witness claims tall, given the attacker was actually tall (80% accuracy).
* P(T) = Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from the population).
* P(W1) = Probability of the first witness claiming tall, regardless of the attacker's height. This needs to be calculated.

**3. Calculate P(W1)**

We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|¬T) * P(¬T)

Where:

* P(W1|¬T) = Probability the first witness claims tall, given the attacker was actually short (20% error).
* P(¬T) = Probability of the attacker being short (85% from the population).

Plugging in the values:

P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(T|W1)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
