Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have conflicting information from two witnesses and prior knowledge about the height distribution in the city. We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information to get the updated probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller).

**Let's define the events:**

* **T:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **S:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is tall.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is short.

**We know:**

* **P(T) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is tall.
* **P(S) = 0.85:** 85% of the population is short.
* **P(W1|T) = 0.8:** The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time.
* **P(W1|S) = 0.2:** The first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time.
* **P(W2|S) = 0.7:** The second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time.
* **P(W2|T) = 0.3:** The second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|S) * P(S)

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(W1):**
   P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(T|W1):**
   P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  â‰ˆ 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4615.**
