Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population data, is 0.15 (from statement "a").
* **P(¬A):** The probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given they actually are tall, is 0.80 (from statement "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given they are actually short, is 0.20 (from statement "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's claim:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

where P(B) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is tall:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
*  P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.41.**
