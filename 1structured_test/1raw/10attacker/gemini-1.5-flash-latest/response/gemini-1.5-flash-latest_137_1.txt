Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in information "a").
* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (1 - P(A)).

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker is actually tall (true positive) is 0.80 (given in information "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker is actually short (false positive) is 0.20 (given in information "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To get P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
