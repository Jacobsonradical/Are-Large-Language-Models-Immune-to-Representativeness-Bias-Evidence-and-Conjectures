Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker *is* actually 185 cm or taller. This is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * **P(B|not A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (i.e., the witness is wrong). This is the error rate of the first witness, which is 20% (0.2).
    * **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller, which is the percentage of the population shorter than 185 cm (85% or 0.85).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately **0.414**.
