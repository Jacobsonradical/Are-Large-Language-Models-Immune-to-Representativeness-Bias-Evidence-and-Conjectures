Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Data:**

* **Population Height:**  We know 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This means there's a prior probability of 0.15 that a randomly chosen person from the city would be this tall.
* **Witness Reliability:** 
    * Witness 1:  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.
    * Witness 2: Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they are wrong 30% of the time.

**2.  Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.  Here's how it applies:

* **Let A be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"**
* **Let B1 be the event "Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller"**

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B1|A):** The probability that Witness 1 would say the attacker is tall *given* that the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B1):** The probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is tall (regardless of the actual height). We need to calculate this.

**3.  Calculating P(B1):**

To find P(B1), we need to consider all the ways Witness 1 could say the attacker is tall:

* **Case 1:** The attacker is tall (A), and Witness 1 is correct (B1|A):  Probability is P(B1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Case 2:** The attacker is short (not A), and Witness 1 is wrong (B1|not A): Probability is P(B1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4.  Putting it Together:**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
