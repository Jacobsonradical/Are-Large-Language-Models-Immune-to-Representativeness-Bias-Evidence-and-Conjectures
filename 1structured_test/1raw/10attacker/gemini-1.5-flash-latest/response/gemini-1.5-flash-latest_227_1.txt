Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in the information).
* **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter (20% error).

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness's testimony:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**5. Calculation:**

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
* P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(A|B) ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
