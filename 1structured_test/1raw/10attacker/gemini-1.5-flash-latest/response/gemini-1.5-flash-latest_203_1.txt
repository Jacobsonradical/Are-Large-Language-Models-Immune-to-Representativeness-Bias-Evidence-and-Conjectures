Here's how we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  We know their accuracy in similar situations.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. It helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony). 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Problem:**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:**  The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Here's how we break down the components:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the witness claiming "185 cm or taller" given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population statistic, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness claiming "185 cm or taller". This is a bit trickier. We need to consider the witness's accuracy *and* the population distribution. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): Probability of the witness claiming "185 cm or taller" given the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): Prior probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller. This is 85% or 0.85.

    Therefore:
    P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25
P(A|B) = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
