Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**From the information provided:**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in "b").
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 80% (given in "a").
* **P(B| not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 20% (given in "a").

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculate the components:**

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
* P(B|A) = 0.80
* P(B|not A) = 0.20

**Plug the values into the formula:**

P(A|B) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.33
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

**Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.36}
