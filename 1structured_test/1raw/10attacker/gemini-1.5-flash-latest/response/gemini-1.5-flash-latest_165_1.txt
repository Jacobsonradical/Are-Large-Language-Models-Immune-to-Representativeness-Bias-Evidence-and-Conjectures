Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from the city population data).
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we'll calculate this later).

**3.  Calculate Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given in the problem)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is actually tall)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is tall when they are not) 

**4.  Calculate P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios where the attacker is tall and where they are not:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**5.  Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
