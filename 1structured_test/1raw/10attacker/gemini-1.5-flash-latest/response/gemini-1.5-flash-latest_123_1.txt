Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of conflicting information:

* **Witness Testimony:** One witness says the attacker was tall (185 cm or taller), the other says short.
* **Population Statistics:**  Most people in the city are short (85% below 185 cm).

We need to combine these to find the likelihood the attacker was actually tall.

**Bayesian Reasoning**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.

* **Let 'T' represent the event that the attacker was tall (185 cm or taller).**
* **Let 'S' represent the event that the attacker was short (below 185 cm).**
* **Let 'W1' represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker was tall.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Where:

* P(T | W1) = Probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony. (What we want to find)
* P(W1 | T) = Probability the first witness claims tall given the attacker was actually tall (80% accuracy).
* P(T) = Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from population statistics).
* P(W1) = Probability the first witness claims tall (This needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(W1)**

We need to consider both scenarios where the attacker is tall and short:

* P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T)  +  P(W1 | S) * P(S)
* P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)  = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can calculate P(T | W1):

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T | W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and population statistics, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
