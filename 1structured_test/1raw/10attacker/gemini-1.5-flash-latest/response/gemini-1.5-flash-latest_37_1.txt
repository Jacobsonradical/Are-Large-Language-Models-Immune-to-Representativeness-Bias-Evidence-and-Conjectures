Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' testimony. 

**Let's define some events:**

* **T:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We need to find:** P(T|W1), the probability the attacker was tall given witness 1's testimony.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):** Probability witness 1 claims tall given the attacker is tall (80% from the given information).
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from the given information).
* **P(W1):** Probability of witness 1 claiming tall, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|¬T) * P(¬T)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Plugging everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T|W1) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
