Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from the provided information).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not (from the provided information).
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city (from the provided information).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm in the city.

**Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.33

**P(A|B) ≈ 0.36**

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.36.**

**{probability: 0.36}**
