Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

1. **Population statistics:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This represents the prior probability of an individual being tall.
2. **Witness testimony:** We have two witnesses, each with their own accuracy levels in identifying height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.  Here's how it applies:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.**
* **We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% or 0.15 from the population statistics.
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. This is calculated using the law of total probability, considering both possibilities (attacker tall or short):

    P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
    P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414 or about 41.4%.
