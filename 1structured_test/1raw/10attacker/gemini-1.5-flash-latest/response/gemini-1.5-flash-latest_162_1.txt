Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from the city population data).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that height.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**Calculate P(B):**

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.26

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26 ≈ 0.46

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46}
