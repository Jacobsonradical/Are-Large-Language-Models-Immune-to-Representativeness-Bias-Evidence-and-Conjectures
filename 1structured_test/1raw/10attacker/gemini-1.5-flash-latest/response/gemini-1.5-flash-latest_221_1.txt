Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (given in the information)
* **P(¬A):** Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming the person is taller given that they are actually taller = 0.80 (accuracy of the first witness)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability of the first witness claiming the person is taller given that they are actually shorter = 0.20 (error rate of the first witness)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To find **P(B)**, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
