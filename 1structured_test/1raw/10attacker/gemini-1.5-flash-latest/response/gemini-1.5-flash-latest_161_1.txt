Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  From information "a", the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** The probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they actually are tall is 0.8 (from information "b").
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they are actually short is 0.2 (from information "b").

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.30
P(A|B) = 0.4

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4}
