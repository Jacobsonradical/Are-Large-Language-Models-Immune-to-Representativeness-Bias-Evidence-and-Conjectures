Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from the population information).
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given they are not (from the witness's error rate).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need P(¬A) which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15)] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
