Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**
