Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Accuracy:**
    * Witness 1 (claims taller): 80% accurate, 20% error.
    * Witness 2 (claims shorter): 70% accurate, 30% error.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem involves conditional probability, making Bayes' Theorem a useful tool. We want to find the probability that the attacker was taller given the first witness's claim:

P(Attacker taller | Witness 1 claims taller)

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | B) = [P(B | A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A | B):  Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B | A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A.
* P(B): Prior probability of event B.

**Applying the Theorem to Our Case**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's break down each term in Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(B | A):** Probability the witness claims "taller" given the attacker IS taller. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is taller. This is the population percentage: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** Probability the witness claims "taller" (regardless of the attacker's actual height).  We need to consider both scenarios:
    * Witness claims "taller" when the attacker is taller (0.8 * 0.15)
    * Witness claims "taller" when the attacker is shorter (0.2 * 0.85)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker taller | Witness 1 claims taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
