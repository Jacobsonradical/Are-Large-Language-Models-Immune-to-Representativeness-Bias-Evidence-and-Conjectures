Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Population Statistics:**  15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:**  We have two witnesses with varying accuracy in judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating beliefs based on new evidence.  In this case, we want to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness testimonies.

Let's define some events:

* **T:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **S:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall.
* **W2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker is short.

We want to find  P(T | W1), the probability that the attacker is tall given Witness 1's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

**Breaking down the terms:**

* **P(W1 | T):** The probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(T):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall. This is the population statistic, 15% (0.15).
* **P(W1):** The probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
    * P(W1 | S):  The probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually short (this is the witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2).
    * P(S): The prior probability the attacker is short (85% or 0.85).

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**

2. **P(T | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.4615 or 46.15%.
