Here's how we can break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given another event (B) has occurred:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy (80%).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion (15%).
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability.

**3. Calculate P(B):**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* ¬A: The attacker is *shorter* than 185 cm.
* P(B|¬A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *actually* shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate (20%).
* P(¬A): Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85%).

**4. Substitute and Calculate:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
