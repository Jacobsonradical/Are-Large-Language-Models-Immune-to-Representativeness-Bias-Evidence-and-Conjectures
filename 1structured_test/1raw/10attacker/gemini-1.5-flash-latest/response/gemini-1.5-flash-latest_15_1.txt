Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **T:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **F:** The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** Witness 2 said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker was tall given Witness 1 said so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

**3.  Break Down the Components:**

* **P(W1|T):**  The probability Witness 1 said "tall" given the attacker was actually tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(T):**  The prior probability the attacker was tall (15% from the population data).
* **P(W1):** The probability Witness 1 said "tall" (this requires the law of total probability).

**4. Calculate P(W1) using the Law of Total Probability:**

P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|F) * P(F)

* P(W1|F):  The probability Witness 1 said "tall" given the attacker was actually short (20% error).
* P(F): The prior probability the attacker was short (85% from the population data).

**5. Substitute and Solve:**

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
