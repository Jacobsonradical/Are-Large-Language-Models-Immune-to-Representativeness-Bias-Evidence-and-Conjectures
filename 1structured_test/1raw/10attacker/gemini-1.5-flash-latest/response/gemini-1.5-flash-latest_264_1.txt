Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Information:**

* **Population Distribution:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1 (Tall):**  80% accuracy, meaning they correctly identify someone as tall 80% of the time, and incorrectly identify them as tall 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2 (Short):** 70% accuracy, meaning they correctly identify someone as short 70% of the time, and incorrectly identify them as short 30% of the time.

**2. Setting up the Problem:**

We need to calculate the probability that the attacker was actually tall (185 cm or taller), given that Witness 1 claimed they were tall.  This is a conditional probability problem.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening, given that event B has already happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening, given that event A has already happened.
* P(A): Probability of event A happening.
* P(B): Probability of event B happening.

**4. Defining Events:**

* A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**5. Calculating Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Probability of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability of Witness 1 claiming tall, given the attacker is actually tall)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Probability of Witness 1 claiming tall, given the attacker is actually short)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (Probability of a randomly selected person being shorter than 185 cm)

**6. Calculating P(B):**

We need to find the overall probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker was tall, regardless of the actual height. We use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**7. Calculating P(A|B):**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.414. This means there's about a 41.4% chance that the witness is correct.
