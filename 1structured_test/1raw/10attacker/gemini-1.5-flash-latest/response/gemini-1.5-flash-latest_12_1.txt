Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  From information "a", the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Based on Witness Testimony)**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate, which is 0.2.

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation**

* **P(B):**  (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* **P(A|B):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  ≈ 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
