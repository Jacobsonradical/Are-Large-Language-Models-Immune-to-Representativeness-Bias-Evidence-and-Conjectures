Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  Each witness has a certain accuracy in identifying height.
* **Population Distribution:** We know the percentage of the population that falls into each height category.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimony of the two witnesses.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case, the evidence is the witness testimony. 

Let's define the following events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find  P(A | W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1 | A):**  The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the first witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is taller. This is the population distribution, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness claiming "taller". This is the tricky part and requires the law of total probability: 
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | B) * P(B)
    * P(W1 | B): The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter. This is the first witness's error rate, 20% or 0.2.
    * P(B): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter, 85% or 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(W1):**
   P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A | W1):**
   P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
