Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.  This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is a bit trickier and requires us to consider both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker IS 185 cm or taller. The probability the witness correctly identifies this is 80%.
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker IS NOT 185 cm or taller. The probability the witness incorrectly identifies this as 185 cm or taller is 20%.

**3. Calculate P(B):**

To find P(B), we need to consider the probability of the witness's claim in each scenario and weigh them by the likelihood of each scenario:

* **P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]** 
* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29**

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
