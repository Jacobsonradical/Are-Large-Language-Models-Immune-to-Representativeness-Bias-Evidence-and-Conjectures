Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Accuracy:**  We know how often each witness is correct about a person's height.
* **Population Distribution:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine these pieces of information to determine the likelihood that the attacker was taller than 185 cm, given the conflicting witness statements.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the first witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness says the attacker is taller than 185 cm, given that the attacker *actually* is taller than 185 cm. This is the witness's accuracy for correctly identifying taller people: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm. This is the population percentage of taller people: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness says the attacker is taller than 185 cm. We need to consider both cases:
    * **Case 1:** The attacker is taller, and the witness is correct (probability = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12).
    * **Case 2:** The attacker is shorter, and the witness is wrong (probability = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
        = 0.12 / 0.29
        â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

Therefore, based on the witness's accuracy and the city's population distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
