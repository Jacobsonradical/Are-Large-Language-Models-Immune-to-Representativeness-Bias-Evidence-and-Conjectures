Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  From information "a", the probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).
* **P(¬A):** The probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).

**3. Conditional Probabilities (Based on witness accuracy):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person is actually taller is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the person is actually shorter is 0.2 (20%). 

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to calculate the probability of the attacker being taller given the witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.34
P(A|B) ≈ 0.353

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353}
