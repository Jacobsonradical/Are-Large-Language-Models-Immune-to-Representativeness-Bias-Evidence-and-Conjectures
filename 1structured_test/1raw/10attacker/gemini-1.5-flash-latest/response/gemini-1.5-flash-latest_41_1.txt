Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Given: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B1 | A) = 0.80** (First witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
* **P(B1 | ¬A) = 0.20** (First witness incorrectly identifies taller people 20% of the time)
* **P(B2 | A) = 0.20** (Second witness incorrectly identifies taller people 30% of the time)
* **P(B2 | ¬A) = 0.70** (Second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)

**4.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A | B1), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), we need the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A | B1):**

P(A | B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
