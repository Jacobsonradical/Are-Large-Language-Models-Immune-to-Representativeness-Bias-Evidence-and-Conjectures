Here's how to break down the problem to arrive at the probability estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **General Population:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify height 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify height 30% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider the following scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller** 
    * Witness 1 is correct (80% chance)
    * Witness 2 is incorrect (30% chance)

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm**
    * Witness 1 is incorrect (20% chance)
    * Witness 2 is correct (70% chance)

Now, let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

* **Scenario 1 Probability:** 0.15 (population taller than 185 cm) * 0.80 (witness 1 correct) * 0.30 (witness 2 incorrect) = 0.036
* **Scenario 2 Probability:** 0.85 (population shorter than 185 cm) * 0.20 (witness 1 incorrect) * 0.70 (witness 2 correct) = 0.119

**Final Calculation**

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to divide the probability of Scenario 1 by the sum of probabilities of both scenarios:

Probability = (Scenario 1 Probability) / (Scenario 1 Probability + Scenario 2 Probability)

Probability = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119) 
Probability = 0.036 / 0.155 
Probability â‰ˆ 0.232

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.232}
