Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Accuracy:**
    * Witness 1 (claimed taller): 80% accuracy, 20% error.
    * Witness 2 (claimed shorter): 70% accuracy, 30% error.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider the different scenarios and their probabilities:

1. **Scenario 1: Attacker is taller (185 cm or taller)**
   * **Witness 1 is correct:**  Probability = 0.15 (population proportion) * 0.80 (witness accuracy) = 0.12
   * **Witness 1 is wrong:** Probability = 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03

2. **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter (shorter than 185 cm)**
   * **Witness 1 is correct:** Probability = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17 
   * **Witness 1 is wrong:** Probability = 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.68

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony. It's a way of calculating conditional probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Let's apply this to our problem:**

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is taller.

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of attacker being taller)
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (probability of Witness 1 claiming taller given the attacker is actually taller)
* **P(B):** We need to calculate this, the probability of Witness 1 claiming taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.  This can be calculated by adding the probabilities of Witness 1 being correct in both scenarios (0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29)

**Calculation**

P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 claims taller) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
