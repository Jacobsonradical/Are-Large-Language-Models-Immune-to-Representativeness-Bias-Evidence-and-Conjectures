Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** This is the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% (0.15) based on the population distribution.
* **P(¬A):** The probability of a randomly chosen person being shorter than 185 cm is 85% (0.85).

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller than 185 cm, given that the attacker actually is taller than 185 cm. This is the accuracy rate of the first witness, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate of the first witness, which is 20% (0.2).

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given that the first witness claims so. Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**
* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
