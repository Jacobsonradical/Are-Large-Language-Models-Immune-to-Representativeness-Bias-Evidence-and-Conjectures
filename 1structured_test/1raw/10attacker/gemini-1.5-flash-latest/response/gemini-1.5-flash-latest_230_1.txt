Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20** (The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
