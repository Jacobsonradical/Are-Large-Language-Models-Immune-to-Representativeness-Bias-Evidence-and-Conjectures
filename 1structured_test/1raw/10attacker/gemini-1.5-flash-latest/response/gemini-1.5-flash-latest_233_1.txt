Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Population data:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness reliability:**  We know the accuracy rates of each witness.

We need to combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem.  Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness testimony).

Let's define the following events:

*  **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:**  The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, based on the city's population data, which is 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
