Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (from information "a")
* **P(A') = 0.85** (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (from witness accuracy):**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (First witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A') = 0.20** (First witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(C|A) = 0.20** (First witness incorrectly identifies someone taller than 185 cm)
* **P(C|A') = 0.80** (First witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was taller than 185 cm given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') 
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138** (rounded to 4 decimal places)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
