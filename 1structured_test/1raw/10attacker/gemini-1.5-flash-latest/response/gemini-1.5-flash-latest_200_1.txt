Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:**  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.

**Reasoning**

We need to consider the combined evidence:

1. **Prior Probability:** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% based on the city's population.

2. **Witness 1's Testimony:**  Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, there's a 20% chance they are wrong.

3. **Combining Evidence:** To get the most accurate estimate, we need to consider the probability of the attacker being tall *given* Witness 1's testimony.  This is a Bayesian reasoning problem.

**Calculation**

We can't directly calculate the exact probability with the given information.  We need to make a simplifying assumption. 

* **Assumption:** We'll assume that the witnesses are independent (their testimonies don't influence each other). This might not be completely true, but it's a reasonable starting point.

**Estimating the Probability**

Since we don't have enough information to perform a formal Bayesian calculation, we can make a logical estimate:

* Witness 1 is more likely to be correct about tall people (80% accuracy) than incorrect. 
* However, there's a significant chance they are wrong (20%).

**Our Estimate**

Considering the prior probability of 15% and the witness's accuracy, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is **slightly higher than the prior probability.** 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.20}  (This is a rough estimate. A more accurate calculation would require more information about how the witnesses' accuracy relates to the true population distribution of heights.)
