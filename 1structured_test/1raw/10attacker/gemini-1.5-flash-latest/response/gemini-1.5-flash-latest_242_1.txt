Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**1. Understand the Base Rate:**

* The base rate is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller. We know from information "a" that this is 15%.

**2. Consider Witness Testimony:**

* **Witness 1:**  Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. They are correct 80% of the time, but incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. They are correct 70% of the time, but incorrect 30% of the time.

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness testimonies).  

Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness' accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is the base rate of 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to consider both scenarios: 
    * Witness 1 is correct: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * Witness 1 is incorrect: P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    *  P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculate the Probability:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
