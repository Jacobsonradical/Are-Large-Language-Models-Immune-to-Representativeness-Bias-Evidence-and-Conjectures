Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have prior information about the height distribution in the city (from "a") and witness testimony with varying degrees of reliability (from "b"). We want to update our belief about the attacker's height based on this evidence.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker *actually* was 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% from the city's population distribution.
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Plugging everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
