Here's how we can solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B1 | A) = 0.8** (The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is tall)
* **P(B1 | ¬A) = 0.2** (The first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the attacker is short)
* **P(B2 | ¬A) = 0.7** (The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the attacker is short)
* **P(B2 | A) = 0.3** (The second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the attacker is tall)

**We want to find P(A | B1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.**

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / [P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A | B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A | B1) = 0.12 / 0.33

**P(A | B1) ≈ 0.36**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.36}
