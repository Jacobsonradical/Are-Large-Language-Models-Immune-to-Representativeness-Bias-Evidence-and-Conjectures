Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. 

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is given as 15% (0.15) from the population data (information 'b').
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85% (0.85).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B1|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller given that they actually were taller is 80% (0.8) from information 'a'.
* **P(B1|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller given that they actually weren't taller is 20% (0.2) from information 'a'.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

```
P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1) 
```

Where P(B1) can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

```
P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A) 
```

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
