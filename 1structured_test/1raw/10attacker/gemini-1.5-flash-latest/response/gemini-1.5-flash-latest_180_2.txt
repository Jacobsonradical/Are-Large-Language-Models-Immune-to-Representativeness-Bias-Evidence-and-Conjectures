Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (From information "a", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the attacker is taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (The first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need P(¬A), which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.  Since P(A) = 0.15, then P(¬A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
