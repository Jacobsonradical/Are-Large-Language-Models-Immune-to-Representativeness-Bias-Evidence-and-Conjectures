Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **General Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** 80% accuracy in identifying height correctly, 20% error rate.
* **Witness 2:** 70% accuracy in identifying height correctly, 30% error rate.

**Logic**

We need to consider the likelihood of each witness being correct, given their accuracy rates and the population distribution of heights.

**Calculation**

1. **Witness 1's Statement:**  The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.  We need to consider two scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker *is* 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identified their height (80% probability).
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is *shorter* than 185 cm, and the witness made a mistake (20% probability).

2. **Witness 2's Statement:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We need to consider two scenarios:
    * **Scenario 3:** The attacker *is* shorter than 185 cm, and the witness correctly identified their height (70% probability).
    * **Scenario 4:** The attacker is *185 cm or taller*, and the witness made a mistake (30% probability).

3. **Combining Probabilities:** 
    *  We're most interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's statement.
    *  Scenario 1 is the most likely scenario for this.
    *  To get the probability of Scenario 1, we need to account for the base probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the population (15%). 

4. **Estimate:** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's statement, is:

    * **(Probability of Witness 1 being correct) * (Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population)** 
    * **(0.80) * (0.15) = 0.12**

**Answer**

{probability: 0.12}
