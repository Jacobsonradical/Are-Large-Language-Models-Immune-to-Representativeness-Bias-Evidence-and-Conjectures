Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1.  Understanding the Problem**

We need to determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies and the population height distribution.  This is a classic example of Bayesian reasoning.

**2.  Setting Up the Problem**

Let's define some events:

* **T:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **F:** The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are asked to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony.

**3.  Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):**  The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall.  This is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80% (given in the problem).
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is 15% based on the population distribution.
* **P(W1):**  The probability of the first witness claiming "tall." We can calculate this using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|F) * P(F)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4.  Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
