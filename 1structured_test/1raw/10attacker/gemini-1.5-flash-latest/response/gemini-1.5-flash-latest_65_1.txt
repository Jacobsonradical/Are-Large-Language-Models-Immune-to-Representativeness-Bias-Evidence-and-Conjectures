Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Given Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** 0.15 (from information "a")
* **P(¬A):** 0.85 (from information "a")
* **P(B|A):** 0.8 (from information "b" - witness is correct when the attacker is tall)
* **P(B|¬A):** 0.2 (from information "b" - witness is incorrect when the attacker is short)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness claimed so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is right and wrong:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
     = 0.26

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26
       = 0.4615 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4615}
