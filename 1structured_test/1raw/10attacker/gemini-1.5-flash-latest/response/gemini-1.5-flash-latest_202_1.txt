Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are not.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

**We need to find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.** We can use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) 
     = 0.28
```

**Now, we can calculate P(A|B):**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 
       = 0.4286 (approximately)
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4286}
