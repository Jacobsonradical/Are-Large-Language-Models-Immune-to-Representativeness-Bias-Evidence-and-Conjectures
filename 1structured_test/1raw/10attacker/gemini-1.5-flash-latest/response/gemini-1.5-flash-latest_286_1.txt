Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **T:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):** Probability the first witness claims tall, given the attacker is actually tall (80% accuracy).
* **P(T):** Prior probability the attacker is tall (15% of the population).
* **P(W1):**  Probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall. We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|~T) * P(~T) 
    *  P(W1|~T) is the probability the first witness claims tall when the attacker is actually short (20% error).
    *  P(~T) is the probability the attacker is short (85% of the population).

**3. Calculations**

* P(W1|T) = 0.8
* P(T) = 0.15
* P(W1|~T) = 0.2
* P(~T) = 0.85

Now, calculate P(W1):
* P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Finally, calculate P(T|W1):
* P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
