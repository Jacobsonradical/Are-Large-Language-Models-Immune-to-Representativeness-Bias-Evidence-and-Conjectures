Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A | B1), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's claim.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B1 | A) = 0.80:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall person.
* **P(B1 | not A) = 0.20:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker tall and attacker short):

P(B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | not A) * P(not A)
P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A | B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A | B1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
