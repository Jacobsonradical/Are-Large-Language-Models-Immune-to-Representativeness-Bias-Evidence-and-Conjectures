Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller (from the city population).
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (from the witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not (from the witness's error rate).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**Plugging in the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.412

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.412}
