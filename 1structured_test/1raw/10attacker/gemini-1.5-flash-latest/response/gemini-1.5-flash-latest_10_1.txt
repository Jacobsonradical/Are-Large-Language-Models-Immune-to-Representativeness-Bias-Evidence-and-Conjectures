Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of attacker being tall given the first witness' claim.
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming tall when the attacker is tall (80% accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% from the city population data).
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming tall (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* P(B|¬A): Probability of the first witness claiming tall when the attacker is not tall (20% error).
* P(¬A): Prior probability of the attacker not being tall (85% from the city population data).

**4. Calculate:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness' claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
