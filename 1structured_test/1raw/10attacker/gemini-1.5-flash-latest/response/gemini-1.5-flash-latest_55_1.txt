Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
*  P(¬A) = 0.85 (The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

**3. Likelihoods (Based on Witness Accuracy)**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are).
*  P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter).

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculate**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4118

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4118}
