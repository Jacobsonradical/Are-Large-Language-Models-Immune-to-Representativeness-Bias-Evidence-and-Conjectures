Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We have conflicting witness testimonies and prior knowledge about the population's height distribution. We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine this information to get the best estimate of the probability that the attacker was tall (185 cm or taller).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Let's define the events:

* **T:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **S:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** Witness 1 says the attacker is tall.
* **W2:** Witness 2 says the attacker is short.

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker was tall given Witness 1 said so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(W1 | T):** Probability Witness 1 says "tall" given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the population data).
* **P(W1):**  This is the overall probability of Witness 1 saying "tall", which we need to calculate using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together:**

P(T | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
