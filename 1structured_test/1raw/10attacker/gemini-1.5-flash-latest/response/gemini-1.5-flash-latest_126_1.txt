Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (Based on witness accuracy):**

* **P(B1|A) = 0.8** (Probability the first witness claims taller given the attacker is taller)
* **P(B1|¬A) = 0.2** (Probability the first witness claims taller given the attacker is shorter)
* **P(B2|A) = 0.2** (Probability the second witness claims shorter given the attacker is taller)
* **P(B2|¬A) = 0.7** (Probability the second witness claims shorter given the attacker is shorter)

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B1)**, the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness claims so. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), we use the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
