Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** Has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying height correctly (regardless of the actual height). 
* **Witness 2:** Has a 70% accuracy rate in identifying height correctly.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider the probabilities of the following scenarios:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller, Witness 1 is correct.**  
    * Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller: 0.15
    * Probability of Witness 1 being correct: 0.80
    * Combined probability: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm, Witness 1 is incorrect.** 
    * Probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 0.85
    * Probability of Witness 1 being incorrect: 0.20
    * Combined probability: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**Finding the Estimate**

We want the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* that Witness 1 claimed so. This is a conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) = [P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness 1 says tall)

Let's break down the parts:

* **P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall):** This is the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is tall, given that the attacker truly is tall, which is 0.80 (their accuracy).
* **P(Attacker is tall):** This is the prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is 0.15.
* **P(Witness 1 says tall):** This is the overall probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker is tall. This can be calculated by considering both scenarios:
    * Scenario 1: 0.12 (calculated above)
    * Scenario 2: 0.17 (calculated above)
    * Total: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138}
