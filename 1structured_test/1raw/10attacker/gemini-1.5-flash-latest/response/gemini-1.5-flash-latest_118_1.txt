Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**3.  Break Down the Components:**

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate, 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is taller, which is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims "taller". This requires the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
