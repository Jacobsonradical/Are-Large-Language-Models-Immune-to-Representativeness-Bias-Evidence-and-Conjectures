Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given some evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, P(A) = 0.15 
* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller GIVEN that the attacker IS actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.80
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(B)**

To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios: the attacker being tall or short.

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller (A):
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
    * P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability)
    * Contribution to P(B): 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A):
    * P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness error)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability)
    * Contribution to P(B): 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17

* **Total P(B):** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Interpretation:**

Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, our estimate is that there is a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller.
