Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  'T' represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let 'S' represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let 'W1' represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is taller.
*  Let 'W2' represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* P(T) = 0.15 (given)
* P(S) = 0.85 (given)

**3. Likelihoods:**

* P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies someone taller as taller)
* P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter as taller)
* P(W2 | S) = 0.70 (The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter as shorter)
* P(W2 | T) = 0.30 (The second witness incorrectly identifies someone taller as shorter)

**4.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker was taller given the first witness said so.  Bayes' Theorem gives us:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we need the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate the Probability:**

Now we can plug back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T | W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
