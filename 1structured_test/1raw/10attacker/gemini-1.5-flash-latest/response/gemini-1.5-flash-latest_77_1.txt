Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Accuracy:** The first witness is accurate 80% of the time, and the second witness is accurate 70% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event based on new evidence.  Let's define:

* **A:**  The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15) based on the population distribution.
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is a bit more complex, and we need to use the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) can be calculated by considering the two possibilities:

1. **The attacker is taller than 185 cm:**  This has a probability of P(A) = 0.15, and the witness is correct with a probability of P(B|A) = 0.8.  Therefore, the probability of this case is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
2. **The attacker is shorter than 185 cm:** This has a probability of 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and the witness is wrong with a probability of 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2.  Therefore, the probability of this case is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

Finally, P(B) is the sum of these two cases: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
