Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the information).
* **P(¬A):** The probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 0.80.
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, 0.20.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness claims "taller".

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
```

To calculate **P(B)**, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**

Now, we can calculate **P(A|B):**

* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
