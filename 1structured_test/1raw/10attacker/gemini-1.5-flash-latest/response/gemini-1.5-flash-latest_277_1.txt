Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (Given in the problem, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
*  P(¬A) = 0.85 (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (First witness identifies correct height when the attacker is tall).
*  P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (First witness incorrectly identifies height when the attacker is short).
*  P(C|A) = 0.20 (Second witness incorrectly identifies height when the attacker is tall).
*  P(C|¬A) = 0.70 (Second witness identifies correct height when the attacker is short).

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 

**5. Calculate:**

* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
