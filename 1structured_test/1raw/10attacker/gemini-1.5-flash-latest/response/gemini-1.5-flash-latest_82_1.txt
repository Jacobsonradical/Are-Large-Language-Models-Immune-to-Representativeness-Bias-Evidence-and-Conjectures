Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability:** 
    * Witness 1 (claims taller): Correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
    * Witness 2 (claims shorter): Correct 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall, given the witness testimony:

* **P(Tall | Witness 1) = [P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness 1)**

Let's break down each term:

* **P(Tall | Witness 1):**  This is the probability we want to find – the probability the attacker is tall, given Witness 1's claim.
* **P(Witness 1 | Tall):** This is the probability Witness 1 would claim someone is tall, given they are actually tall (80% from the witness reliability).
* **P(Tall):** This is the prior probability of someone in the city being tall (15% from the population distribution).
* **P(Witness 1):** This is the overall probability of Witness 1 making their claim.  We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(Witness 1) = [P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] + [P(Witness 1 | Short) * P(Short)]
    * P(Witness 1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now, we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(Tall | Witness 1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
* P(Tall | Witness 1) ≈ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}
