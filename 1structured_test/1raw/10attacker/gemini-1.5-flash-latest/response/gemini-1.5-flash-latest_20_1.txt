Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The first witness correctly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The first witness incorrectly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**We need to calculate P(¬A), the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:**

* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
