Here's how to approach this problem, combining the information from the city population and the witness testimonies:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in "a"). This is our starting point before considering witness testimony.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1 (claims taller):**
    * Likelihood of being correct (attacker is actually taller) = 80% 
    * Likelihood of being incorrect (attacker is actually shorter) = 20%
* **Witness 2 (claims shorter):**
    * Likelihood of being correct (attacker is actually shorter) = 70%
    * Likelihood of being incorrect (attacker is actually taller) = 30%

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony. Let:

*  A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Witness 1 claims attacker is taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood of Witness 1 being correct given the attacker is taller)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possible ways Witness 1 could claim the attacker was taller:

* **Scenario 1:** Attacker is taller, Witness 1 is correct (probability = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12)
* **Scenario 2:** Attacker is shorter, Witness 1 is incorrect (probability = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17)

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculation:**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness testimony and the city's population distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is estimated to be approximately 0.414. This means there is a slightly higher chance that the attacker was taller, but the uncertainty is still significant.
