Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **General population:**  15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness testimony:** We know the accuracy rates of each witness, but we need to consider how their testimony affects the probability of the attacker's height.

**Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem. It helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness testimonies).

Let's define the following events:

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall **given** that the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate for identifying tall people, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on the population statistics.
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall. This can happen in two ways: 
    * The witness is correct (attacker is tall)
    * The witness is wrong (attacker is short)

**Calculating P(B)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability to calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall **given** that the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate for identifying short people, which is 20% (0.2).
* **P(not A):** The probability that the attacker is not tall, which is 85% (0.85).

**Putting it Together**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48}
