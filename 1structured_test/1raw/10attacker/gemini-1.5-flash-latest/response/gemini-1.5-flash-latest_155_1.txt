Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the components:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the first witness said so. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness *correctly* claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker *actually* is 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given in the problem as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:**  The attacker *is* 185 cm or taller (A) and the witness is correct (B|A): P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (not A) and the witness is wrong (B|not A): P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 

    Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**3. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
