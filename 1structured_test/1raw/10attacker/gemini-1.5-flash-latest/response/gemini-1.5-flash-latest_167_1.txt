Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use the witness testimonies and their accuracy rates to determine the probability of the attacker being taller than 185cm. We have:

* **Prior Probability:** The initial probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller is 15% (given in "a").
* **Witness Testimony:**  We have two conflicting testimonies with associated accuracy rates.

**Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief based on new evidence.  Here's how it applies:

* **Let 'T' be the event that the attacker is taller than 185 cm.**
* **Let 'W1' be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is taller.**

We want to find  P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|T):** The probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate of 80%.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 15%.
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness saying "taller".  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|not T) * P(not T) 
    * P(W1|not T) is the probability the witness says "taller" given the attacker is shorter (20% error rate)
    * P(not T) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter (85%)

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(W1):**
   P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(T|W1):**
   P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
