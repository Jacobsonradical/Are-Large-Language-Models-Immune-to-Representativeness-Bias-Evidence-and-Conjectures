Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (from information "b")
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)

**We need to find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:**

* **P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85**

**Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) 

P(A|B) ≈ 0.4118

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4118.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4118}
