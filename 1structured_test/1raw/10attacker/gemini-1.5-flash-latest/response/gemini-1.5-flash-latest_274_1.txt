Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is 15% or 0.15 (from information "a").
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims "tall".  We need to consider both scenarios: 
    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker is tall (A) and the witness is correct (B|A).  This probability is P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is short (not A) and the witness is wrong (B|not A). This probability is (1 - P(A)) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. 

**3. Calculate P(B)**

P(B) = P(Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
