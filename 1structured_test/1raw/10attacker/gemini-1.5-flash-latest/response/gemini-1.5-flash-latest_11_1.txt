Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  **P(A):**  From information "a", we know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.
*  **P(not A):**  The remaining 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. So, P(not A) = 0.85.

**3. Conditional Probabilities:**

*  **P(B|A):**  The probability the first witness claims the attacker was taller, given the attacker was actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
*  **P(B|not A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker was taller, given the attacker was actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability we want, P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**5. Calculation:**

Substitute the values we have:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
