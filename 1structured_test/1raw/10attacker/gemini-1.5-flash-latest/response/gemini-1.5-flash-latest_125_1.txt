Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**1.  Understanding the Prior Probability**

* **Statement "a"** tells us that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability – the likelihood of someone being tall before we consider any witness testimony.

**2.  Witness Testimony and Likelihood Ratios**

* **Witness 1:**  Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
    *  This witness is correct 80% of the time when someone is actually tall.  
    *  This means they are incorrect 20% of the time when someone is actually tall. 
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
    * This witness is correct 70% of the time when someone is actually short.
    * This means they are incorrect 30% of the time when someone is actually short.

**3.  Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimony.  Let's define:

* **A:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness saying "tall" given the attacker was actually tall (80% or 0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% or 0.15).
* P(B): Probability of the first witness saying "tall".  This is a bit trickier and requires considering both scenarios (attacker tall and attacker short):
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)  (Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time if the attacker is short)

**4.  Calculation**

* P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
