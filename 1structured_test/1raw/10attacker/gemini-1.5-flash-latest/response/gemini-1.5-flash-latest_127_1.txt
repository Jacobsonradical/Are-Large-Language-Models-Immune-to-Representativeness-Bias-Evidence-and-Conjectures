Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two conflicting pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** One witness says the attacker was taller than 185 cm, the other says shorter.
* **Population Statistics:** The majority of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to weigh these pieces of information to determine the most likely scenario.

**Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is ideally suited for Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.  Let's define:

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is the population proportion of people taller than 185 cm, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall (regardless of the actual height).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28 

**Calculating the Probability:**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.429

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.429}
