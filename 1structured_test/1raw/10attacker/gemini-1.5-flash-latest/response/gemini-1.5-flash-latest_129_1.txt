Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **T:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1 | T):**  The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is the percentage of the population that is tall, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness claiming "tall", which we need to calculate.

**3. Calculate P(W1):**

We can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | not T) * P(not T)

* **P(W1 | not T):** The probability the first witness claims "tall" given the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
* **P(not T):** The probability of the attacker being short, which is 85% or 0.85.

Therefore:

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

**4. Calculate P(T | W1):**

Now we have all the pieces to use Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.48}
