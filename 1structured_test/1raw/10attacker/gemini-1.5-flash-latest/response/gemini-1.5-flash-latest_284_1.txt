Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Prior Information:** 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our initial belief about the attacker's height.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses, one claiming taller and one claiming shorter. We need to combine their testimony with the prior information to get an updated belief about the attacker's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. In this case:

* **Event A:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is taller, given that the attacker *is* taller. This is 80% (the witness's accuracy).
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is taller, which is 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is taller (regardless of the actual height). We need to calculate this using the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
