Here's how to break down this problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  Witness 1 says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and Witness 2 says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We know their accuracy rates.
* **Population Distribution:**  We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

To find the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (event A) given the witness testimony (event B).  This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the witness testimony given the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (based on the population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness testimony (we'll need to calculate this).

**Calculations**

1. **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in the problem).

2. **P(B|A):**  This is the probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker was taller, given that the attacker *was* taller. This is the accuracy rate of Witness 1, which is 80%.

3. **P(B|not A):** This is the probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker was taller, given that the attacker was *not* taller. This is the error rate of Witness 1, which is 20%.

4. **P(not A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85% (given in the problem).

5. **P(B):** The probability of the witness testimony can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
   * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
