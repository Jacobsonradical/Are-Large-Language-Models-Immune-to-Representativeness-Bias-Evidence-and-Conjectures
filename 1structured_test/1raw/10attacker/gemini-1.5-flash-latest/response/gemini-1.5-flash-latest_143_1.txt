Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**1.  Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% based on the city population statistics (information "a").

**2.  Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1 (claimed taller):** 
    *  Likelihood of being correct if the attacker was actually taller: 80%
    *  Likelihood of being wrong if the attacker was actually shorter: 20%
* **Witness 2 (claimed shorter):**
    * Likelihood of being correct if the attacker was actually shorter: 70%
    * Likelihood of being wrong if the attacker was actually taller: 30%

**3.  Bayesian Calculation**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update the prior probability based on the witness testimonies:

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  W1 = Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker was taller
*  W2 = Event that Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter

We want to find P(A | W1), the probability that the attacker was taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we need to consider both scenarios (attacker taller and attacker shorter):

P(W1) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | not A) * P(not A)

Let's calculate:

* P(W1 | A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct if the attacker is taller)
* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of the attacker being taller)
* P(W1 | not A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 is wrong if the attacker is shorter)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being shorter)

Therefore:

* P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

Now we can calculate P(A | W1):

* P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimonies and their reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 or 48%.
