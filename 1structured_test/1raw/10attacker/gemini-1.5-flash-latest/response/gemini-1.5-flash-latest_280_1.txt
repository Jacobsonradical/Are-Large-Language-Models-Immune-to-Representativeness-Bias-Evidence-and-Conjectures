Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the population statistics).
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming "taller".  This requires considering both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1: Attacker is taller** (probability 0.15) and the witness is correct (probability 0.8) 
    * **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter** (probability 0.85) and the witness is wrong (probability 0.2)

Therefore:
* P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
