Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the estimate:

**Understanding the Information**

* **General Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they're wrong 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they're wrong 30% of the time.

**Calculating the Probability**

We need to consider the following possibilities:

1. **Witness 1 is correct:** 
   * The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (15% of the population), and Witness 1 correctly identified them (80% chance).
   * This probability is 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

2. **Witness 1 is wrong:**
   * The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (85% of the population), and Witness 1 incorrectly identified them as 185 cm or taller (20% chance).
   * This probability is 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

**Combining the Probabilities**

To find the overall probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim, we use Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness 1 says Tall) = [P(Witness 1 says Tall | Attacker Tall) * P(Attacker Tall)] / P(Witness 1 says Tall)**

Where:

* **P(Attacker Tall | Witness 1 says Tall):** The probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1 says they are. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness 1 says Tall | Attacker Tall):** The probability Witness 1 says the attacker is tall given they actually are tall (0.80).
* **P(Attacker Tall):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall (0.15).
* **P(Witness 1 says Tall):** The probability Witness 1 says the attacker is tall, which is the sum of the probabilities of cases 1 and 2 above (0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29)

**Calculating the Final Probability**

P(Attacker Tall | Witness 1 says Tall) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
