Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  We know the accuracy of each witness in identifying heights.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the proportion of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm, given the conflicting witness statements.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probabilities. In this case, we want to find:

P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 says taller) 

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 says taller):**  The probability the attacker is taller, given Witness 1 says so. This is what we want to find.
* **P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is taller):** The probability Witness 1 says the attacker is taller, given they actually are taller (this is 80% from the information provided).
* **P(Attacker is taller):** The prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 15% from the population statistics.
* **P(Witness 1 says taller):** The probability Witness 1 says the attacker is taller, regardless of the actual height. This is calculated using the law of total probability:  P(Witness 1 says taller) = P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is taller) * P(Attacker is taller) + P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter) 

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(Witness 1 says taller):**
   * P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is taller) = 0.8
   * P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is shorter) = 0.2 (since they are wrong 20% of the time)
   * P(Attacker is shorter) = 0.85
   * P(Witness 1 says taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 says taller) = [P(Witness 1 says taller | Attacker is taller) * P(Attacker is taller)] / P(Witness 1 says taller)
   P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 says taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
   P(Attacker is taller | Witness 1 says taller) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the information about the witnesses' accuracy and the city's population statistics, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, even though Witness 1 claimed so. This is significantly lower than the witness's accuracy rate, reflecting the impact of the prior probability of a person being that height in the population.
