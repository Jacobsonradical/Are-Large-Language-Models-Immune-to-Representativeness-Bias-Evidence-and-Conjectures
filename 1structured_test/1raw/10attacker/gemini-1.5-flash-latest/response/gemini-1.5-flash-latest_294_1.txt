Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in information "a"). This is our starting point.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:**  
    * Likelihood of correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller: 80%
    * Likelihood of incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as taller: 20%
* **Witness 2:**
    * Likelihood of correctly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm: 70%
    * Likelihood of incorrectly identifying someone 185 cm or taller as shorter: 30%

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimony.  Let's focus on Witness 1, as they claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

* **Event A:**  Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:**  Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's statement.
* P(B|A) = Likelihood of Witness 1 correctly identifying someone 185 cm or taller (80%)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15%)
* P(B) = Probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this requires a bit more calculation).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to consider both scenarios where Witness 1 is correct and incorrect:

* **Scenario 1:  Witness 1 is correct** 
    * Probability = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Witness 1 is incorrect**
    * Probability = P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17  (¬A means "attacker is shorter than 185 cm")

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**In conclusion, based on the available information and Witness 1's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**
