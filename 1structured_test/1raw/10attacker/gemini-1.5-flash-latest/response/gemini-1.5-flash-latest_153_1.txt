Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability that the attacker is tall.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:**  The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming someone is tall when they are actually tall is 80% (correct identification). The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming someone is tall when they are actually short is 20% (error).
* **Witness 2:** The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming someone is short when they are actually short is 70% (correct identification). The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming someone is short when they are actually tall is 30% (error).

**3. Bayesian Approach**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior probability based on the witness testimonies. However, since we have two witnesses with conflicting testimonies, we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:  Attacker is tall (185 cm or taller)**
    * Witness 1: 80% chance of saying "tall" 
    * Witness 2: 30% chance of saying "short"
    * Combined probability of this scenario: 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24 

* **Scenario 2: Attacker is short (shorter than 185 cm)**
    * Witness 1: 20% chance of saying "tall"
    * Witness 2: 70% chance of saying "short"
    * Combined probability of this scenario: 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

**4. Normalizing the Probabilities**

To get the final probability of the attacker being tall, we need to normalize the probabilities of the two scenarios:

* Probability of attacker being tall: 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.14) = 0.63

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.63}
