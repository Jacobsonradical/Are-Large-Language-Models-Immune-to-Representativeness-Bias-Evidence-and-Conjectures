Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Information from the Problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller (given in the problem).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they actually are (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are not (20% error).

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claimed so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**4. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**
* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
