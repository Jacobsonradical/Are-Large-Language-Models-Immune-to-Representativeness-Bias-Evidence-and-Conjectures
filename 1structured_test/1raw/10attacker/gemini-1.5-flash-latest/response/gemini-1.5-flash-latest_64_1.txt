Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* From information "a", we know P(A) = 0.15 (the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
* Therefore, P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* From information "b", we know:
    * P(W1 | A) = 0.80 (the probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller)
    * P(W1 | not A) = 0.20 (the probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter)
    * P(W2 | A) = 0.20 (the probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker is actually taller)
    * P(W2 | not A) = 0.70 (the probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker is actually shorter)

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A | W1), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness claims so.  Bayes' Theorem helps us:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | not A) * P(not A)

**5. Calculations**

* P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
