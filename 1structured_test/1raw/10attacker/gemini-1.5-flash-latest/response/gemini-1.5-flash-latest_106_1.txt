Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have conflicting witness testimonies and need to determine the likelihood that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm, given the witnesses' accuracy and the population distribution of heights.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimonies). 

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let W2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller given that they *actually* are taller. This is the witness's accuracy, given as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is the proportion of the population taller than 185 cm, given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):**  Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller. This requires considering both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1:** Attacker is actually taller (A) - Probability = P(W1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2:** Attacker is actually shorter (not A) - Probability = P(W1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * **Total P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Putting it together**

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
