Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. 
* **Population Data:**  85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimony.

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion, which is 15%.
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%.
* P(not A): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85%.

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
