Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Understand the Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability (the probability before considering any witness testimony).

**2. Analyze Witness Testimony:**

* **Witness 1:**  Correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify taller people as shorter 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify shorter people as taller 30% of the time.

**3. Consider the Combined Evidence:**

We need to consider both witness testimonies together. Since we don't know the actual height of the attacker, we have to consider both possibilities:

* **Scenario 1: Attacker was actually taller than 185 cm**
    * Witness 1: 80% chance of being correct 
    * Witness 2: 30% chance of being incorrect (claiming attacker was shorter)

* **Scenario 2: Attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm**
    * Witness 1: 20% chance of being incorrect (claiming attacker was taller)
    * Witness 2: 70% chance of being correct

**4. Bayes' Theorem (Optional but helpful)**

Bayes' Theorem can be used to formally calculate the updated probability:

* P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

Where:
* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A
* P(B) = Probability of event B

**5. Calculation:**

Let's apply Bayes' Theorem to our scenario:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **Event B:** Both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate:

* P(A|B) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses claimed so

We have:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (probability of both witnesses claiming taller given the attacker is actually taller)
* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being taller)
* P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85) = 0.238 (probability of both witnesses claiming taller)

Therefore:

* P(A|B) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.238 â‰ˆ 0.151

**Answer:** {probability: 0.151}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller increases slightly from the initial 15% to about 15.1%. However, it's still quite low due to the unreliability of the witnesses.
