Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **¬A:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **¬B:** The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.**

**We know the following from the information provided:**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter.
* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (based on the city population).
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the Law of Total Probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
