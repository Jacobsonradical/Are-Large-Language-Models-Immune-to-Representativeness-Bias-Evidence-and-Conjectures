Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

*  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in information 'a'). This is our baseline assumption before considering the witness testimonies.

**2. Witness Testimony and Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:** Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
    *  **Likelihood:** Given the witness's accuracy, there's an 80% chance they're correct if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. 
    *  **Likelihood:** There's a 20% chance they're wrong if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. 
    * **Likelihood:** There's a 70% chance they're correct if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
    * **Likelihood:** There's a 30% chance they're wrong if the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.  We'll focus on the first witness's claim:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Likelihood of Witness 1 being correct if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B)** is the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* **P(B|not A) = 0.2** (Likelihood of Witness 1 being wrong if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

**4. Calculation:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
