Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1.  Understanding the Information**

* **Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:** Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify height 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they incorrectly identify height 30% of the time.

**2. Bayesian Reasoning**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness testimony:

* **P(Tall | Witness 1 says Tall):** Probability of the attacker being tall given the first witness claims they were tall.
* **P(Witness 1 says Tall | Tall):** Probability of the first witness saying the attacker was tall given they actually were tall (this is 80% from the information).
* **P(Tall):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall (this is 15% from the population data).
* **P(Witness 1 says Tall):** Probability of the first witness saying the attacker was tall, regardless of their actual height.  This requires a bit more calculation:
    * P(Witness 1 says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall) = 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 
    * P(Witness 1 says Tall | Short) * P(Short) = 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    * P(Witness 1 says Tall) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(Tall | Witness 1 says Tall) = [P(Witness 1 says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness 1 says Tall)
                                   = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
                                   â‰ˆ 0.414
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
