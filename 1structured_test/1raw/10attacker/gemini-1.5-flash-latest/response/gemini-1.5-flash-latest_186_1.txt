Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information "b").
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (from information "a").
* **P(B|not A) = 0.2:** The probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:**

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is tall (A) and the witness is correct (B|A): P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is short (not A) and the witness is wrong (B|not A): P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
