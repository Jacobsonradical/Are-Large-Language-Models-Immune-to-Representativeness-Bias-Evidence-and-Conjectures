Here's how to break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and we know their accuracy.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm given the first witness's testimony.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence.  It looks like this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find)
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our Problem**

Let's define our events:

* A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
* B: The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the first witness's testimony.

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness says the attacker is tall given they actually are tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** The probability that the attacker is tall, which is the percentage of the population that is tall, 15% (0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability that the first witness says the attacker is tall.  This can happen in two ways: 
    * The attacker is tall, and the witness is correct.
    * The attacker is short, and the witness is wrong. 

We can calculate P(B) using the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|Not A) * P(Not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Therefore, given the first witness's testimony, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
