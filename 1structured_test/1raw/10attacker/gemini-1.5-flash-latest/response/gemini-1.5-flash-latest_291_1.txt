Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **General Population:** 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with varying accuracy in judging height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).  Here's how it applies:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** Probability of the first witness claiming "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% (0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% (0.15) based on the population data.
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming "tall." This is a bit trickier. We need to consider both scenarios: 
    * The attacker is tall (and the witness is correct): 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
    * The attacker is short (and the witness is wrong): 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Calculating P(A|B)**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Based on the witness's testimony and the general population data, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 (or 41.4%).
