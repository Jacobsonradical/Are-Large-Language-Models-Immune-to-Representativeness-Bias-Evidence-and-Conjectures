Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A):** This is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, given by information "a":  P(A) = 0.15

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy, given by information "b": P(B|A) = 0.80
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate: P(B|not A) = 0.20

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem tells us how to update our belief about the attacker's height (A) given the witness's testimony (B):

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

Where P(B) is the total probability of the witness making that claim, calculated using the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
```

**5. Calculation**

* **P(not A):** This is the probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm: P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

* **P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

* **P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414. This means that the witness's testimony has increased the probability from the initial 0.15 (population proportion) to about 0.414. However, it's still more likely (1 - 0.414 = 0.586) that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
