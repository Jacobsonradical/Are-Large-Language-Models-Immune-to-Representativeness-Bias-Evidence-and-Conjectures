Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the conflicting witness testimonies. We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief based on the new information.

**Setting up the Variables**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let W2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness claims tall given the attacker is tall. This is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):**  Probability of the first witness claiming tall. This requires the Law of Total Probability: 
    * P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Calculating the Probability**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the witness testimonies and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
