Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define some events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.**

**We know the following from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (The first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.7** (The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter)
* **P(C|A) = 0.3** (The second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is taller)

**Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is tall and short:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:**

{probability: 0.414}
