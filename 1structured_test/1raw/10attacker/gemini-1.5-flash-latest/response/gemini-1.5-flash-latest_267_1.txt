Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  We know the accuracy rates of the two witnesses.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the percentage of the population that is taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine this information to estimate the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm, given the first witness's claim.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is well-suited for Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here's the breakdown:

* **Let A be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller".**
* **Let B be the event "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller".**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller. This is the first witness's accuracy rate, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm. This is the population statistic, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims "taller".  We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability. This means we consider both cases:

* **Case 1: Attacker is taller:** P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Case 2: Attacker is shorter:** P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Interpretation**

This means that given the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was actually taller is about 41.4%.
