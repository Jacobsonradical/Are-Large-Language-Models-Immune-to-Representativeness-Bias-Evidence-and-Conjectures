Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.  Here's how the terms relate:

* **Prior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *before* we consider the witness testimonies (85% of the population is shorter, so this is 15%).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of each witness giving their testimony *given* the attacker's true height.
* **Posterior Probability:** The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *after* considering the witness testimonies.

**Calculations**

Let's define some events:

*  A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  ¬A: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
*  W1: Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  W2: Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A | W1), the probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down the components:

* **P(W1 | A):** Probability of Witness 1 saying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** Probability of Witness 1 saying "tall". We need to use the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)
    * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26 

**Putting it Together**

Now we can calculate P(A | W1):

P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26  ≈ 0.46 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.46} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's testimony, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.  While Witness 1's statement increases the likelihood, it's still not a strong certainty due to the possibility of error.
