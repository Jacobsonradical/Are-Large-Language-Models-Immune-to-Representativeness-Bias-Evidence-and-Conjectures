Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** The probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20:** The probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not.

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**Let's break down the calculation:**

* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** The probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

**Now, substitute the values:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
