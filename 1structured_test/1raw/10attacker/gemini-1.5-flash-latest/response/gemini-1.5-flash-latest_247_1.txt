Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **T:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Where:

* P(T | W1) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(W1 | T) is the probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are. This is the first witness's accuracy (80%).
* P(T) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller (15%).
* P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(W1)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability to find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | not T) * P(not T)

* P(W1 | not T) is the probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are not (this is the witness's error rate, 20%).
* P(not T) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85%).

So:

P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(T | W1)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
