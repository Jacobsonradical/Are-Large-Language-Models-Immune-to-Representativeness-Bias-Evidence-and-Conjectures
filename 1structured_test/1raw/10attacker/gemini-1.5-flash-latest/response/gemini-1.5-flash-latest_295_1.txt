Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**1. Understanding the Information**

* **Population Data:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimony:**
    * Witness 1 (claimed taller): 80% accuracy, 20% error.
    * Witness 2 (claimed shorter): 70% accuracy, 30% error.

**2.  Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.  

Let:

*  **A:** Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** Probability that Witness 1 claims "taller" given the attacker is actually taller (this is the witness's accuracy, 80%).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller (this is the population proportion, 15%).
* **P(B):**  Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller". We need to calculate this.

**3.  Calculating P(B)**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

* **P(B|¬A):** Probability that Witness 1 claims "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter (this is the witness's error rate, 20%).
* **P(¬A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being shorter (1 - 0.15 = 0.85).

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Putting it all together**

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.41 or 41%.  While Witness 1's testimony increases the likelihood compared to the initial population proportion (15%), it's not a definitive confirmation.
