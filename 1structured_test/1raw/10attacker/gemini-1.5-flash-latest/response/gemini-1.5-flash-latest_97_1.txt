Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1.  Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Accuracy:**
    * Witness 1 (claims taller): 80% accuracy, 20% error.
    * Witness 2 (claims shorter): 70% accuracy, 30% error.

**2.  Setting up the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims they were taller. This is a conditional probability problem.

**3.  Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A.
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B.

**4.  Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem**

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down the elements of Bayes' Theorem:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from population distribution)
* **P(B|A):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually taller = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
* **P(B| not A):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter = 0.20 (witness error)
* **P(not A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from population distribution)

**5.  Calculating P(B)**

To find P(B), we need the probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" in all scenarios:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.28

**6.  Final Calculation**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
