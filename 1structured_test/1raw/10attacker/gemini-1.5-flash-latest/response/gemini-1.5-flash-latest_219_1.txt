Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).
* P(A): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (given in the information as 15%).
* P(B): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  We need to calculate this.

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We can find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* P(B|¬A): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is *not* actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's error rate).
* P(¬A): The probability of the attacker *not* being 185 cm or taller (1 - 0.15 = 0.85).

**4. Plug in the values:**

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy when the attacker is tall)
* P(A) = 0.15
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (witness's error rate when the attacker is not tall)
* P(¬A) = 0.85

Therefore:

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Interpretation:**

This means that given the first witness's claim, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 46.15%.
