Here's how to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Where:

* P(A | W1): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(W1 | A): Probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).  Given in the problem as 80% (0.8).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the population proportion). Given in the problem as 15% (0.15).
* P(W1): Probability of the first witness making the claim (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(W1):**

To get P(W1), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the witness is correct (W1 | A).
   * Probability: P(A) * P(W1 | A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A), and the witness is wrong (W1 | not A).
   * Probability: P(not A) * P(W1 | not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

* **Total P(W1):**  Add the probabilities of the two scenarios: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
           = 0.12 / 0.29
           â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** 

{probability: 0.414}
