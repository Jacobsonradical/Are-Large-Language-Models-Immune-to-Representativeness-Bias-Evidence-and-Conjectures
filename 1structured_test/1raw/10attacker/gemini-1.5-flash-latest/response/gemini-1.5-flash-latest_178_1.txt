Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **General Population:**  15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have the accuracy of each witness in identifying height. This allows us to update our probability based on their observations.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**Calculating the Probabilities**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the population statistics).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they actually are tall is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given they are actually short is 0.2 (20% error).
* **P(not A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (1 - 0.15).

**Calculating P(B)**

To get P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the first witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
