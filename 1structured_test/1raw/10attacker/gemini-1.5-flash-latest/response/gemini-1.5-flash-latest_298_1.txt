Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies. 

**Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B happening.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Let's define our events:

* **A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Calculations**

1. **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in the information).
2. **P(B|A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are is 80% (given in the information).
3. **P(B|¬A):** The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not is 20% (since the witness errs 20% of the time).
4. **P(¬A):** The probability that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller is 85% (given in the information).

**Calculating P(B):**

We need to calculate the overall probability of the first witness making this claim using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.26

**Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.26
P(A|B) ≈ 0.462

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.462}
