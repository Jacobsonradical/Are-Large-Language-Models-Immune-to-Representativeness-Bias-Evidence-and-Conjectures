Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness Accuracy:**
    * Witness 1 (claims taller): Correct 80% of the time, wrong 20%
    * Witness 2 (claims shorter): Correct 70% of the time, wrong 30%

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies.  Let's define the events:

* **T:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller
* **S:** Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* **W1:** Witness 1 claims attacker is taller
* **W2:** Witness 2 claims attacker is shorter

We want to find  P(T | W1), the probability that the attacker is taller given Witness 1's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1 | T):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker *is* taller. This is the witness's accuracy, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(T):** Prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 15% or 0.15 from the population distribution.
* **P(W1):** Probability of Witness 1 claiming "taller" (regardless of the actual height).  We need to calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
    * P(W1 | S) = 0.2 (Witness 1 is wrong if the attacker is shorter)
    * P(S) = 0.85 (Prior probability of the attacker being shorter)

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(W1):**
   P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   P(T | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's testimony, is approximately 0.48 or 48%.
