Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Understand the Base Rate**

* The base rate is the probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% (given in statement "a").

**2. Consider Witness Testimony**

* **Witness 1:**  Claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. They're correct 80% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. They're correct 70% of the time.

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony). 

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  W1 = Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
*  P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (base rate of 0.15)
*  P(W1|A) = Probability of Witness 1 making the correct claim given the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8)
*  P(W1|not A) = Probability of Witness 1 making the incorrect claim given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.2)
*  P(A|W1) =  The probability we want to find - the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.

Bayes' Theorem: 
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

**4. Calculate**

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
* P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (since Witness 1 is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter)

Now, plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
         = 0.12 / 0.27
         â‰ˆ 0.444

**Answer:**
{probability: 0.444} 

**Conclusion:**

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.444.
