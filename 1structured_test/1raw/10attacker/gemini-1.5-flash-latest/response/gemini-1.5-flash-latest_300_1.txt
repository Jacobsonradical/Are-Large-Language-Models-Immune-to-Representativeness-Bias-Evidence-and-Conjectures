Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **¬A:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **¬B:** The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* **P(¬B|A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* **P(¬B|¬A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time)

**We want to find P(A|B) - the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.41

**Answer:** {probability: 0.41} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.**
