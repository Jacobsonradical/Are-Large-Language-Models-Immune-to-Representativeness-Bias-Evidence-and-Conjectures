Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two sources of information:

1. **Population Statistics:**  85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. **Witness Testimony:**  We have two witnesses with different claims and different accuracy rates.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (attacker's height) based on new evidence (witness testimony).

* Let  "H" be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(H | W1) = [P(W1 | H) * P(H)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(W1 | H):**  The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate, which is 80%.
* **P(H):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the city's population statistics.
* **P(W1):** The probability of the first witness making their claim. This requires considering both scenarios (attacker is tall or short) and their respective probabilities:
    * P(W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) + P(W1 | not H) * P(not H) 
    * P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Calculation**

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(H | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
