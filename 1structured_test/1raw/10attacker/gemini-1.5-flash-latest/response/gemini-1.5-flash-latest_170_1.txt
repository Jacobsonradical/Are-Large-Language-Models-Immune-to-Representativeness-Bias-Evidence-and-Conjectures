Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability estimate:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  One witness says the attacker was taller than 185cm (let's call this "Tall"), and another says shorter (let's call this "Short"). We know their accuracy rates.
* **Population Distribution:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm (Short) and 15% are 185cm or taller (Tall).

**Bayes' Theorem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being Tall given the first witness's testimony:

P(Tall | Witness1 says Tall) = [P(Witness1 says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness1 says Tall)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(Witness1 says Tall | Tall):** This is the probability the witness correctly identifies someone as Tall when they are actually Tall.  We're given this as 80% or 0.8.
* **P(Tall):** This is the prior probability of someone being Tall, which is the population distribution of 15% or 0.15.
* **P(Witness1 says Tall):** This is the probability of the witness saying Tall, which can happen in two ways:
    *  They correctly identify someone as Tall (P(Witness1 says Tall | Tall) * P(Tall))
    *  They incorrectly identify someone as Tall (P(Witness1 says Tall | Short) * P(Short))

**Calculations**

1. **P(Witness1 says Tall | Short):** This is the probability the witness incorrectly identifies someone as Tall when they are actually Short. Since the witness is accurate 80% of the time, they are wrong 20% of the time (1 - 0.8 = 0.2).

2. **P(Witness1 says Tall):** 
   * (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

3. **P(Tall | Witness1 says Tall):**
   * (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.48 or 48%.**
