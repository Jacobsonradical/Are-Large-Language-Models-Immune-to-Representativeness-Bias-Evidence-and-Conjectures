Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let  `A` be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let `B1` be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let `B2` be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

**3. Break Down the Components:**

* **P(B1|A):**  The probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker *is* taller. This is the first witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability the attacker is taller, which is 15% or 0.15 (from the population data).
* **P(B1):** The probability the first witness claims "taller." This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**4. Calculate P(A|B1):**

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:** {probability: 0.43}
