Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. (This is what we want to find)
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. (This is the first witness' accuracy, 80%)
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (This is the population proportion, 15%)
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (We need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* P(B|¬A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (This is the first witness' error rate, 20%)
* P(¬A): Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (This is the population proportion, 85%)

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
