Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probability:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a") 
*  P(not A) = 0.85

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall)
*  P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually short)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the first witness claims they are tall.  Bayes' Theorem tells us:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

**5. Calculate:**

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] 
* P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
* P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
