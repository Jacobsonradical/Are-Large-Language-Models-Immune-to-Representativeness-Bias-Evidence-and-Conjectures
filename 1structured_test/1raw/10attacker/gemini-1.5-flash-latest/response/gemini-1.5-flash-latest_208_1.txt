Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **General Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:**  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, meaning they are wrong 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, meaning they are wrong 30% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief about an event (the attacker's height) based on new evidence (the witness statements).  Here's how it applies:

* **Event:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Prior Probability (P(Event)):**  This is the initial probability before considering the witness statements, which is 15% or 0.15 (based on the population distribution).
* **Evidence:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Likelihood (P(Evidence|Event)):**  The probability of the witness making this claim *given* that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **Likelihood (P(Evidence|Not Event)):**  The probability of the witness making this claim *given* that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 20% or 0.2 (since they are wrong 20% of the time).

**Calculations**

Let's use "T" for "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "W1" for "witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller".

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker is tall given witness 1's statement.

Bayes' Theorem:  
P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / [P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|Not T) * P(Not T)]

* P(W1|T) = 0.8 (likelihood of witness 1 being correct)
* P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being tall)
* P(W1|Not T) = 0.2 (likelihood of witness 1 being wrong)
* P(Not T) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker not being tall)

Plug in the values:

P(T|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) 
P(T|W1) â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Explanation**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%. This is higher than the initial 15% probability because the witness is generally reliable in identifying height. However, it's important to remember that there's still a significant chance (about 59%) that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.
