Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.

**Let's Define:**

*  **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**What We Know:**

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the population data).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall *given* they actually are tall is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall *given* they are actually short is 0.2 (20% error).

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Calculating P(B):**

To get P(B), we need the probability of the witness claiming tall in both scenarios:

* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Putting it Together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28  ≈ 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.43.**
