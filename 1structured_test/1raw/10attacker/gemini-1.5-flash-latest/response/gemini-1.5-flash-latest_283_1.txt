Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have conflicting witness testimonies and need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness statements.

**Terminology:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.**

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the first witness's accuracy, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall, which is 15% or 0.15 (based on the population distribution).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. This can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
