Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:  P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A|B):**  The probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the first witness said so. This is what we want to find.
* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness *correctly* identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given they actually are. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the population proportion: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The overall probability the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This requires considering both scenarios:

    * **Scenario 1:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller (probability 0.15) and the witness is correct (probability 0.8): 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
    * **Scenario 2:** The attacker is shorter (probability 0.85) and the witness is wrong (probability 0.2): 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

    * **P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**

**3. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**
