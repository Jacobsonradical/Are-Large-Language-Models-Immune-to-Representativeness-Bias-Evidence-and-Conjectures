Here's how we can break down the problem to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate the probability of an event (A) given that another event (B) has occurred:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15% of the population).
* P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this needs to be calculated).

**3. Calculate P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is correct and incorrect:

* **Scenario 1:**  The attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the witness is correct (B|A): 
    * Probability = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (not A), and the witness is incorrect (B|not A):
    * Probability = P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug the values into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29  â‰ˆ 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
