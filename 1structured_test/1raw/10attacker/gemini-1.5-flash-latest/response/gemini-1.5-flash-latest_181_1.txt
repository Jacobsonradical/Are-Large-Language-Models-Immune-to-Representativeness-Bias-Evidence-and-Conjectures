Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability, meaning the probability before considering any witness testimony.

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:**  The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker was actually taller is 80%. The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming "taller" given the attacker was actually shorter is 20%.
* **Witness 2:** The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming "shorter" given the attacker was actually shorter is 70%. The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming "shorter" given the attacker was actually taller is 30%.

**3. Bayes' Theorem:**

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the updated probability of the attacker being taller, given the testimony of both witnesses. Let's break it down:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims "taller" and Witness 2 claims "shorter".

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is taller given the witnesses' testimony.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(B|A): Probability of the witnesses' testimony (B) given the attacker is taller (A). This is the product of the likelihoods of each witness's statement: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being taller, which is 0.15.
* P(B): Probability of the witnesses' testimony, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    *  P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14
    *  P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being shorter)
    *  P(B) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.179

**4. Calculation:**

P(A|B) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.179 â‰ˆ 0.201

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.201} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.201.**
