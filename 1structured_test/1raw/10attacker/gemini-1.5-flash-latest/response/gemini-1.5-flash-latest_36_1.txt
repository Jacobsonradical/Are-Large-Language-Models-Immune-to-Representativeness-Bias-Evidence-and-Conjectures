Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Given in the information provided) 
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities)**

* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability of the first witness correctly identifying someone taller than 185 cm)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**5. Calculate P(B)**

To use Bayes' Theorem, we need to calculate P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was taller than 185 cm. We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.29

**6. Calculate P(A|B)**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.29)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**
