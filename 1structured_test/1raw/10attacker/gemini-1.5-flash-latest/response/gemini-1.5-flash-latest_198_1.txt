Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (from information "b") - The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  P(¬A) = 0.85 - The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

*  P(B1 | A) = 0.80 - The probability that the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
*  P(B1 | ¬A) = 0.20 - The probability that the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A | B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To calculate P(B1), we use the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A | B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.41}
