Here's how we can break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**1. Prior Probability:**

* The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% based on the city's population distribution (information "a").

**2. Likelihoods:**

* **Witness 1:**  The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming "185 cm or taller" given the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 80%. The likelihood of Witness 1 claiming "185 cm or taller" given the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm is 20%.
* **Witness 2:** The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming "shorter than 185 cm" given the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm is 70%. The likelihood of Witness 2 claiming "shorter than 185 cm" given the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 30%.

**3. Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so.  Bayes' Theorem helps us:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller") = 
[P(Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller" | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / 
[P(Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller" | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller" | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

Plugging in the values:

= (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
