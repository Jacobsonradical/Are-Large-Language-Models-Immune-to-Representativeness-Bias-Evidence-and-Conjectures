Here's how to break down the problem and calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  We know the accuracy rates of the two witnesses, but their testimonies contradict each other.
* **Population Statistics:** We know the overall distribution of heights in the city.

We need to use this information to determine the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our beliefs about an event based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the witness testimony.

Let's define:

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability that the attacker is tall, which is the proportion of tall people in the city, 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is tall.  This is calculated using the law of total probability:

    P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

    * P(B|not A): The probability the witness claims the attacker is tall given the attacker is actually short. This is the witness's error rate for short people, 20% or 0.2.
    * P(not A): The probability the attacker is short, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
    P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.25

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
    P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.25 = 0.48

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.48} 

**Conclusion**

Based on the witness testimony and population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.48 or 48%.
