Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(¬A):** The probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods (Conditional Probabilities):**

* **P(B1|A):**  The probability witness 1 claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall is 0.80.
* **P(B1|¬A):** The probability witness 1 claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually short is 0.20.
* **P(B2|A):** The probability witness 2 claims the attacker is short *given* the attacker is actually tall is 0.30 (since they are wrong 30% of the time).
* **P(B2|¬A):** The probability witness 2 claims the attacker is short *given* the attacker is actually short is 0.70.

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker is tall given witness 1 claims they are tall.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), we need to use the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A) 

**5. Calculate:**

* P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** 
{probability: 0.414}
