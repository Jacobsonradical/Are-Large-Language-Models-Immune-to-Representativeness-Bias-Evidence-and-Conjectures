Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let 'A' be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let 'W1' be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let 'W2' be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness said so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each component:

* **P(W1|A):** The probability the first witness says tall given the attacker is tall. This is the witness's accuracy for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability the attacker is tall. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(W1):** The probability the first witness says tall. This requires the Law of Total Probability:
   * P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
   * P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

**3. Calculate P(A|W1)**

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
