Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (from information 'a').
* **P(¬A) = 0.85:** 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The first witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time (from information 'b').
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The first witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
