Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:**  The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population, is 0.15 (15%). 
* **P(¬A):** The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually taller is 0.8 (80% accuracy).
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability of the first witness claiming "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter is 0.2 (20% error).

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
```

**5. Calculation:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615}
