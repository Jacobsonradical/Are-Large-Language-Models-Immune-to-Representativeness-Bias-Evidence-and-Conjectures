Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find:** P(A | B1), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We know:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (from information "b")
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(B1 | A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height if it's 185 cm or taller)
* P(B1 | ¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height if it's shorter than 185 cm)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A | B1) = [P(B1 | A) * P(A)] / [P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | ¬A) * P(¬A)]

P(A | B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

P(A | B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(A | B1) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
