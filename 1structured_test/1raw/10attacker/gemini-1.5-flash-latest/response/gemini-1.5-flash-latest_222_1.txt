Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have conflicting information from two witnesses. We need to use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness information with the population prevalence of height to find the probability the attacker was taller than 185 cm.

**Let's define some events:**

* **T:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **S:** The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**Given Information:**

* **P(T) = 0.15** (15% of the population is taller than 185 cm)
* **P(S) = 0.85** (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1 | T) = 0.8** (First witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is tall)
* **P(W1 | S) = 0.2** (First witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is short)
* **P(W2 | S) = 0.7** (Second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is short)
* **P(W2 | T) = 0.3** (Second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is tall)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find **P(T | W1)**, the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T | W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
