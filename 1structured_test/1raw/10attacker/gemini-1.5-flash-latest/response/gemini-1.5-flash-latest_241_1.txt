Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given from information "a")
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (The attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (from witness testimonies):**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
* **P(C|A) = 0.20** (The second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.70** (The second witness correctly identifies a short person)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker could be tall or short:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
