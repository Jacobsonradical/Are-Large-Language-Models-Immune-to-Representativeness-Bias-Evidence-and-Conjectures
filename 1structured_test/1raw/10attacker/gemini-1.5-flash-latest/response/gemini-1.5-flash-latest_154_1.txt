Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** This is the probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(¬A):** This is the probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**3. Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** This is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller, given that the attacker is actually taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate of 80% or 0.8.
* **P(B|¬A):** This is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate of 20% or 0.2.

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate P(B), we need the Law of Total Probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**5. Calculation:**

* **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26**

* **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615 (approximately)**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4615} 

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4615.
