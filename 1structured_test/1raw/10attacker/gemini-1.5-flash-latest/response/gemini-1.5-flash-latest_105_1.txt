Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let 'T' be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let 'S' be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let 'W1' be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(T) = 0.15 (given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
*  P(S) = 0.85 (given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods:**

*  P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as taller given they are actually taller)
*  P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as taller given they are actually shorter)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker is taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S) 
      = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
      = 0.34

**5. Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.34
            = 0.353 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.353}
