Here's how we can break down the problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **General Population:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
* **Witness 1:**  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
* **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies height 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.

**Logic:**

We need to consider the probabilities of both witnesses being correct and incorrect, and how those probabilities relate to the general population distribution. 

**Calculation:**

1. **Probability of Witness 1 being correct:** If the attacker was truly 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance Witness 1 would correctly identify this. 
2. **Probability of Witness 2 being incorrect:** If the attacker was truly 185 cm or taller, there's a 30% chance Witness 2 would incorrectly say the attacker was shorter. 
3. **Combined Probability:** To get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witness statements, we need to consider the scenarios where Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect.  

We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate this:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect) = [P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect)

* P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 
* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the general population information)
* P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect) is a bit trickier to calculate directly. We'd need to consider all possible scenarios (both witnesses correct, both incorrect, etc.). 

**Approximation:**

Since we don't have all the information to calculate the denominator exactly, we can make a reasonable approximation:

* Assume the probability of Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being incorrect is roughly proportional to the probability of each individual event.

Therefore, a rough estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

0.24 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.3) = **0.15**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.15} 

**Important Note:** This is an approximation. A more precise calculation would require considering all possible scenarios and their associated probabilities.
