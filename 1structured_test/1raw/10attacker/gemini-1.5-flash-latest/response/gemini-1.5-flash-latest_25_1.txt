Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* that the first witness claimed they were.  This is a conditional probability problem.

**Let's define our events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We need to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.**

**Information from the problem:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The first witness correctly identifies someone as tall 80% of the time.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The first witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall 20% of the time.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We need to calculate P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall.  We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 ≈ 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
