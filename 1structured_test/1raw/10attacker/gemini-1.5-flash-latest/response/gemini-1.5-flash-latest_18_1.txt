Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies. 

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone taller than 185 cm)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(C|¬A) = 0.7** (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(C|A) = 0.3** (Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone taller than 185 cm)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.4615.**
