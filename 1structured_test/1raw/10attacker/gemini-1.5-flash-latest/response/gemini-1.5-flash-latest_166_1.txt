Here's how to calculate the probability using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following from the given information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (based on city population).
* **P(B1|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall attacker (80% accuracy).
* **P(B1|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall (20% error rate).

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We need to calculate P(¬A), which is the probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, let's plug in the values:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B1) ≈ 0.414

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.414}
