Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We have two pieces of information:

* **Witness Testimony:**  We know the accuracy rates of each witness.
* **Population Distribution:** We know the percentage of people in the city who are taller or shorter than 185 cm.

We need to combine this information to determine the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm, given the first witness's claim.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened (what we want to find). In this case, it's the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm, given the first witness claimed so.
* **P(B|A):** The probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. In this case, it's the probability that the first witness would claim someone is taller than 185 cm, given that they actually are.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of event A happening. In this case, it's the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm, which is 15% based on the population distribution.
* **P(B):** The probability of event B happening. This is the overall probability of the first witness claiming someone is taller than 185 cm, and we need to calculate it.

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A) = 0.8:** This is the first witness's accuracy rate in correctly identifying someone as taller than 185 cm.
2. **P(A) = 0.15:** This is the probability of someone being taller than 185 cm in the city.
3. **P(B):**  We need to calculate the overall probability of the first witness claiming someone is taller than 185 cm.  This involves two scenarios:

   * **Scenario 1:** The person is actually taller than 185 cm (probability 0.15) and the witness is correct (probability 0.8).
   * **Scenario 2:** The person is actually shorter than 185 cm (probability 0.85) and the witness is wrong (probability 0.2).

   Therefore, P(B) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.29

4. **P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.414** (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the first witness's testimony, the probability that the attacker was actually taller than 185 cm is approximately 0.414, or about 41.4%.
