Here's how to calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events**

* **T:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each part:

* **P(T|W1):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (what we want to find).
* **P(W1|T):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they *actually* are (this is the witness's accuracy: 80%).
* **P(T):** The prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this is the population proportion: 15%).
* **P(W1):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(W1)**

We can use the Law of Total Probability:
P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|~T) * P(~T)

* **P(W1|~T):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are *not* (this is the witness's error rate: 20%).
* **P(~T):** The probability the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (this is the complement of the population proportion: 85%).

Therefore:

P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(T|W1)**

Now we have all the pieces for Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
