Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our belief about an event (A) given new evidence (B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the first witness's claim.  This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker *is* 185 cm or taller (the witness's accuracy). This is 80% (from the information given).
* P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (from the city's population statistics). This is 15%.
* P(B): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (regardless of the actual height). This is a bit trickier and requires the Law of Total Probability.

**3.  Calculate P(B):**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

* P(B|not A): The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (the witness's error rate). This is 20%.
* P(not A): The probability that the attacker is *not* 185 cm or taller (from the city's population statistics). This is 85%.

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**
