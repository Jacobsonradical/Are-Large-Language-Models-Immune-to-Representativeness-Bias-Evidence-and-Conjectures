Here's how to solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**1. Define Events**

*  Let **A** be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
*  Let **B** be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Prior Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods**

* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the attacker is actually taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.20** (The first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the attacker is actually shorter)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 
*P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)*

To find P(B), we need to use the law of total probability:
*P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)*
*P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29*

**5. Calculate the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:
*P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138*

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.**
