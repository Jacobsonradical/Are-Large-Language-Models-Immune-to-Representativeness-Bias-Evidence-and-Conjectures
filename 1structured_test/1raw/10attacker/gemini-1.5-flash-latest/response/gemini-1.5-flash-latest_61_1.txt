Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are.  This is the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% from the city's population statistics.
* P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This needs to be calculated.

**3. Calculate P(B):**

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)

Where:

* P(B|¬A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter (i.e., the witness is wrong), which is 20%.
* P(¬A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

So, 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate P(A|B):**

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.41}
