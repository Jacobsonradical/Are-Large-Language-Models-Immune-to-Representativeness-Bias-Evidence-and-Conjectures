Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being tall (185 cm or taller) given the witness testimonies.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. 
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem to our problem:**

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's break down the terms:

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (given in the information).
* **P(B|A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is actually tall is 80% (given in the information).
* **P(B|not A):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is actually short is 20% (given in the information, as it's the error rate).
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall. This requires us to consider both possibilities (attacker is tall and attacker is short):
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
    * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.31

**Calculating P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.31
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.387

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.387}
