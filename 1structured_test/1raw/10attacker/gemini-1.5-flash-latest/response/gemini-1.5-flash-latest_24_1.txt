Here's how to break down the problem and arrive at an estimate:

**Understanding the Information:**

* **Population Data:** 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, meaning 15% are 185 cm or taller. This gives us a prior probability of the attacker being tall.
* **Witness Testimony:**  We have two witnesses with different claims and varying accuracy.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

To estimate the probability of the attacker being tall given the witness testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(Tall | Witness 1) = [P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(Witness 1)

Where:

* P(Tall | Witness 1) is the probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1's statement.
* P(Witness 1 | Tall) is the probability Witness 1 would say "tall" given the attacker is tall (80% accuracy).
* P(Tall) is the prior probability of the attacker being tall (15%).
* P(Witness 1) is the overall probability of Witness 1 making their statement, which we need to calculate.

**Calculating P(Witness 1):**

P(Witness 1) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Witness 1 | Short) * P(Short)

* P(Witness 1 | Short) is the probability Witness 1 would say "tall" given the attacker is short (20% error).
* P(Short) is the prior probability of the attacker being short (85%).

**Plugging in the Numbers:**

* P(Witness 1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(Tall | Witness 1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Estimate:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
