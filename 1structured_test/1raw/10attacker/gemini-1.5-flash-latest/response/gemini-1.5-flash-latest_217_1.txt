Here's how we can calculate the probability:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Use Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
* P(B|A): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (this is the witness's accuracy).
* P(A): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (this is the population proportion).
* P(B): Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we'll calculate this later).

**3. Gather Information from the problem:**

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

**4. Calculate P(B):**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios where the witness is right and wrong:

* **Scenario 1: Witness is right (A is true):** 
    * P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
* **Scenario 2: Witness is wrong (A is false):**
    * P(B|~A) * P(~A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 
    *  (The witness is wrong 20% of the time, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

* **Total P(B):** 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**5. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
