Here's how to approach this problem:

**1.  Understand the Base Rate:**

* The base rate tells us that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

**2.  Consider the Witness Testimony:**

* **Witness 1:**  They correctly identify height 80% of the time. This means they're likely to say someone is 185 cm or taller even if they're not (20% of the time).
* **Witness 2:** They correctly identify height 70% of the time. This means they're likely to say someone is shorter than 185 cm even if they're not (30% of the time).

**3.  Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

Bayes' Theorem helps us update our belief in the attacker's height given the witness testimony.  Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  B = Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability Witness 1 claims someone is 185 cm or taller given they actually are. This is the accuracy of the witness, 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):**  The prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):**  The probability of Witness 1 making the claim.  We need to account for both true positives (correctly identifying someone as tall) and false positives (incorrectly identifying someone as tall):
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
    *  P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the witness's error rate when someone is *not* tall)
    *  P(¬A) = 0.85 (the probability someone is *not* 185 cm or taller)

**4.  Calculate the Probability:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.26
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.26 = 0.4615

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4615} 

**Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.4615.**
