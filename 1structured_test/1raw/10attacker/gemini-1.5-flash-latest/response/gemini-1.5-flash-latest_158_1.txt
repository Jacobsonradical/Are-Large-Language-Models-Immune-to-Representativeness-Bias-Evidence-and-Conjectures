Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.**

**We have the following information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  The prior probability of the attacker being tall (from the city population data).
* **P(B|A) = 0.8:** The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall person.
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2:** The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**To find P(B), we need the law of total probability:**

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) 
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.28

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.28 = 0.4286 (approximately)

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4286}
