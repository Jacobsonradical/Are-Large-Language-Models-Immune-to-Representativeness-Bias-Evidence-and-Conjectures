Here's how to calculate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem:**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' testimonies. We have:

* **Prior Probability:**  The initial probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller (15% from information "b").
* **Likelihood:** The probability of each witness giving their testimony given the attacker's true height.
* **Evidence:** The witnesses' testimonies.

**Calculations:**

Let:

*  A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
*  ¬A = Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
*  W1 = First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
*  W2 = Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Where:

* **P(W1|A)** = Probability of the first witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually tall (80% from information "a")
* **P(A)** = Prior probability of a person being tall (15% from information "b")
* **P(W1)** = Probability of the first witness saying "tall" (this needs to be calculated)

**Calculating P(W1):**

We need to consider both scenarios (attacker tall or short):

* **P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)**

* **P(W1|¬A)** = Probability of the first witness saying "tall" given the attacker is actually short (20% from information "a")
* **P(¬A)** = Prior probability of a person being short (85% from information "b")

**Putting it Together:**

1. P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}
