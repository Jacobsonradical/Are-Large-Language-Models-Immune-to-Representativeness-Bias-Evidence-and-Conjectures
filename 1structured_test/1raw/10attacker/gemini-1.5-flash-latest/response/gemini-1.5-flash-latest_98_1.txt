Here's how to approach this problem:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2.  Use Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem states: 

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (80% accuracy).
* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% from the population data).
* P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (we need to calculate this).

**3. Calculate P(B)**

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios:

* **Scenario 1:**  The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (A is true).  The probability of the witness being correct is 80% (P(B|A)).
* **Scenario 2:**  The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A is false). The probability of the witness being wrong is 20% (1 - P(B|not A)).

We can use the law of total probability to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.28

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Now we have all the components for Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.28 
       â‰ˆ 0.43

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.43}
