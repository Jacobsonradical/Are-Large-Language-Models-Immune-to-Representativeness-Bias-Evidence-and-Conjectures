To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.30 (probability of the first witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.20 (probability of the second witness being incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 × 0.20 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.20 × 0.15 + 0.30 × 0.70 × 0.85)
            ≈ 0.024 / (0.024 + 0.1785)
            ≈ 0.024 / 0.2025
            ≈ 0.1185

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.1185 or 11.85%.
