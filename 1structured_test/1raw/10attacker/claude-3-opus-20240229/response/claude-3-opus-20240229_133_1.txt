To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (second witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (second witness's error rate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims they are and the second witness claims they are not.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.70 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2553
