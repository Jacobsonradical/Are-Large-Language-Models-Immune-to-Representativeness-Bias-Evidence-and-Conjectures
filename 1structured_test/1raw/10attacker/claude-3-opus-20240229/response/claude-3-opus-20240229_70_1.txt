To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.414.
