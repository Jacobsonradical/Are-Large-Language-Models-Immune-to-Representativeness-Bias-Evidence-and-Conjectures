To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(not A)
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 × 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
