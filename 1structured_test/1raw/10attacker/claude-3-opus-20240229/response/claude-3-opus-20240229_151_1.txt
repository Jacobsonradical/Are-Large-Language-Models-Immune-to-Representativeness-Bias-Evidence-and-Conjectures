To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- T: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- S: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(T|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the claims of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) * P(T) / [P(W1, W2|T) * P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) * P(S)]

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|T) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(W1|S) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(W2|T) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
- P(W2|S) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

Assuming the witnesses' claims are independent, we have:
P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) * P(W2|T) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) * P(W2|S) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W1, W2) = 0.24 * 0.15 / [0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85] = 0.2340425532

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the claims of both witnesses, is:

{probability: 0.2340425532}
