To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness claims and their reliability, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 be the events that witness 1 and 2 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, respectively.

Given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|H) = 0.80 (witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not H) = 0.20 (witness 1 incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(not W2|H) = 0.70 (witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
- P(not W2|not H) = 0.30 (witness 2 incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1 and not W2) = (P(W1|H) * P(not W2|H) * P(H)) / (P(W1|H) * P(not W2|H) * P(H) + P(W1|not H) * P(not W2|not H) * P(not H))

Plugging in the values:
P(H|W1 and not W2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85)
                   ≈ 0.084 / (0.084 + 0.051)
                   ≈ 0.084 / 0.135
                   ≈ 0.622
