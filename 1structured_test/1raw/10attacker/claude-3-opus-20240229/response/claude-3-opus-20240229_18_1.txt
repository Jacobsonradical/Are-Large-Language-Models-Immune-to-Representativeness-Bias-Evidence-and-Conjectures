To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A)) / (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1 and W2|not A) × P(not A))

Assuming the witnesses' statements are independent:
P(W1 and W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.8 × 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1 and W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.2 × 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / (0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2308

{probability: 0.2308}

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2308 or 23.08%.
