To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the claims of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.3 (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Assuming the witnesses' claims are independent, we can calculate:
P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(W1,W2):
P(W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1,W2|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
         = 0.036 + 0.119
         = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the claims of both witnesses:
P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)
           = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155
