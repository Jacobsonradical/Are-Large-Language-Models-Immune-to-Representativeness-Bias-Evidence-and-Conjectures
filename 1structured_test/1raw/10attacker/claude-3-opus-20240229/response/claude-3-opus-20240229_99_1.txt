To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claimed the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
P(C|A) = 0.30 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
