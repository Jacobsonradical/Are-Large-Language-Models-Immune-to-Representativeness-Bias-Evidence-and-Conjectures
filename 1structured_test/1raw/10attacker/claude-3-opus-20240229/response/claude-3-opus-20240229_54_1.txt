To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

We want to calculate P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1, W2|A) * P(A)) / P(W1, W2)

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2|not A) * P(not A)
          = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
          = 0.036 + 0.119
          = 0.155

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.232
