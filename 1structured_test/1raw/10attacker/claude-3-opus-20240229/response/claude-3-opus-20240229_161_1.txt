To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
               â‰ˆ 0.2308

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2308}
