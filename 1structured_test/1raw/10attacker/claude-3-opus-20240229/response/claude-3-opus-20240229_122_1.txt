To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A given B and C:

P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B,C) = (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.70 × 0.85)
         = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
         = 0.036 / 0.155
         ≈ 0.232
