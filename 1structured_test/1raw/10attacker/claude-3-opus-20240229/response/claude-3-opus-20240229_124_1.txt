To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let T be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and S be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
Let W1 be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W2 be the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(T|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|T) * P(T) / [P(W1,W2|T) * P(T) + P(W1,W2|S) * P(S)]

Given:
P(T) = 0.15 (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
P(S) = 0.85 (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|T) = 0.80 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(W1|S) = 0.20 (witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(W2|T) = 0.30 (witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time)
P(W2|S) = 0.70 (witness 2 is correct 70% of the time)

Assuming the witnesses are independent:
P(W1,W2|T) = P(W1|T) * P(W2|T) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|S) = P(W1|S) * P(W2|S) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging into Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1,W2) = 0.24 * 0.15 / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85) = 0.2340

{probability: 0.2340}

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2340 or 23.40%.
