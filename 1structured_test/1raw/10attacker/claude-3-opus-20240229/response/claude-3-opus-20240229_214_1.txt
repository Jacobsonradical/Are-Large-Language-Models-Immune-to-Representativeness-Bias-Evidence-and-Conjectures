To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.30 (the second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, errs 30% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.30 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
       = 0.12 / 0.375
       â‰ˆ 0.32

Therefore, my estimate is:
{probability: 0.32}
