To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- T: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- S: The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15, P(S) = 0.85
- P(W1|T) = 0.8, P(W1|S) = 0.2
- P(W2|T) = 0.3, P(W2|S) = 0.7

We want to find P(T|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) × P(T) / [P(W1, W2|T) × P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) × P(S)]

Assuming the witness statements are independent:
P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) × P(W2|T) = 0.8 × 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) × P(W2|S) = 0.2 × 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting the values:
P(T|W1, W2) = 0.24 × 0.15 / [0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85] ≈ 0.2308

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2308.
