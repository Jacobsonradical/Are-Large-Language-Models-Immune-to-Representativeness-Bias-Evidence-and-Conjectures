To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|A) = 0.30 (probability of the second witness being incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.70 × 0.85)
            ≈ 0.2553

{probability: 0.2553}
