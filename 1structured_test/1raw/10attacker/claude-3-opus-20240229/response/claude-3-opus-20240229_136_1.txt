To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' claims and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2449

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims and their accuracy, is approximately 0.2449 or 24.49%.
