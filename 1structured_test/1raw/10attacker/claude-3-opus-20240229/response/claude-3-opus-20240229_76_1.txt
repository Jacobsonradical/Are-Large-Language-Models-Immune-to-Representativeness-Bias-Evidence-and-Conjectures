To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B,C) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
         = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
         = 0.036 / 0.155
