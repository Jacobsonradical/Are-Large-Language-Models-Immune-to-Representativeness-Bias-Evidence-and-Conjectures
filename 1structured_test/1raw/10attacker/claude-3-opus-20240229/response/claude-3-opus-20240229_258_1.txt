To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1,W2) = (P(W1,W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1,W2|not A) * P(not A))

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness errs 20% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness errs 30% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent:
P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1,W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85) = 0.2338
