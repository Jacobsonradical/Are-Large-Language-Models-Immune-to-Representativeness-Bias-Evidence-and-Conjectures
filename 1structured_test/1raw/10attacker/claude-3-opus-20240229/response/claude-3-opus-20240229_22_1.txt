To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Calculate:
P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
P(B,C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14
P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) + P(B,C|not A) * P(not A) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.155

Now, we can calculate P(A|B,C):
P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.232

{probability: 0.232}
