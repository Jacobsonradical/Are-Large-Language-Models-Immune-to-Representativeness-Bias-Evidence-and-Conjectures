To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims they are and the second witness claims they are not.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85) = 0.2308

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is about 23.08%.
