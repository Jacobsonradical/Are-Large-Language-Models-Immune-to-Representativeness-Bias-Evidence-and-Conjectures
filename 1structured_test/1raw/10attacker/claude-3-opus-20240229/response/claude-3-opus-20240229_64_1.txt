To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)
P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A)) / P(W1 and W2)

Assuming the witnesses' claims are independent:
P(W1 and W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.80 × 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1 and W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14

P(W1 and W2) = P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1 and W2|not A) × P(not A)
             = 0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85
             = 0.036 + 0.119
             = 0.155

Therefore,
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / 0.155 ≈ 0.232

{probability: 0.232}
