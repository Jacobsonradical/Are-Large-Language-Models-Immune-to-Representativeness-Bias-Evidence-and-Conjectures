To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
