To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 be the events that the first and second witnesses claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, respectively.

From the given information:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W1|not H) = 0.20 (first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(W2|not H) = 0.70 (second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1) = (P(W1|H) * P(H)) / (P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|not H) * (1 - P(H)))
        = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
        = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
        = 0.12 / 0.29
