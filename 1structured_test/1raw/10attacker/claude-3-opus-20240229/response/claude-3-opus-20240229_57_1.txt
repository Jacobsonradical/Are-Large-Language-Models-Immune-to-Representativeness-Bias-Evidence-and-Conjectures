To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability of H given W.

From the given information:
P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(W|H) = 0.80 (probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(W|not H) = 0.20 (probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = (P(W|H) * P(H)) / (P(W|H) * P(H) + P(W|not H) * P(not H))
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
