To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1 and W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1 and W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1 and W2|not A) * P(not A))

Assuming the witnesses' statements are independent:
P(W1 and W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1 and W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85) = 0.2328

{probability: 0.2328}
