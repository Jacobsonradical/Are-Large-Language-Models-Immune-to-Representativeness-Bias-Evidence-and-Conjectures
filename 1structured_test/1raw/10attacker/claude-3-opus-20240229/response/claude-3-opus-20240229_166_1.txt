To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims it is and the second witness claims it isn't.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            = 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
