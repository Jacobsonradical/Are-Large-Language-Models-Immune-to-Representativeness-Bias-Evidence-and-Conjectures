To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|A) = 0.30 (probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(W2|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
