To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(C|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)
P(C|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B and C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B and C|A) * P(A) + P(B and C|not A) * P(not A))

P(B and C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(B and C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85) = 0.2328

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the statements of both witnesses, is approximately 0.2328 or 23.28%.
