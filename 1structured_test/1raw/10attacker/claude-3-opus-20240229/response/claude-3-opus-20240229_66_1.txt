To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let T be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and S be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability of being 185 cm or taller)
P(S) = 0.85 (prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm)

Let W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1|T) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness being correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|S) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness being incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|T) = 0.30 (probability of the second witness being incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|S) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness being correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(T|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1,W2) = (P(W1|T) * P(W2|T) * P(T)) / (P(W1|T) * P(W2|T) * P(T) + P(W1|S) * P(W2|S) * P(S))

Plugging in the values:
P(T|W1,W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
            = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
            = 0.036 / 0.155
            â‰ˆ 0.232

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.
