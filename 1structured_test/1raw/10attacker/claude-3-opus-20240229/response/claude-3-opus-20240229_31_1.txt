To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(C|A') = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time, where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims they are 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims they are shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(C|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)

After calculation:
P(A|B and C) â‰ˆ 0.2449

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2449 or 24.49%.
