To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness testimonies and the population data, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (population probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (second witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (second witness's error rate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.70 × 0.85) = 0.2424

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.2424 or 24.24%.
