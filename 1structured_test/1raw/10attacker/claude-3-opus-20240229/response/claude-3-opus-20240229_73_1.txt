To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness claims and the population height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
P(C|A) = 0.3 (probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|not A) = 0.7 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.2449

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims and the population height distribution, is approximately 0.2449 or 24.49%.
