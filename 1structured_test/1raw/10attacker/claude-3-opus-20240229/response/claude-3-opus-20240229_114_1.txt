To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (probability of the first witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (probability of the second witness being incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (probability of the second witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are and the second witness claims they are not.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A)) / (P(B|A) × P(C|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(C|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15) / (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.15 + 0.2 × 0.7 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2449

{probability: 0.2449}
