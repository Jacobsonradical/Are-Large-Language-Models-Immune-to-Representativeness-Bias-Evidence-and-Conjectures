To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A)) / P(W1 and W2)

P(W1 and W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.80 × (1 - 0.70) = 0.24
P(W1 and W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14
P(W1 and W2) = P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1 and W2|not A) × P(not A)
             = 0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85
             = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Substituting the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / 0.155 ≈ 0.232

{probability: 0.232}
