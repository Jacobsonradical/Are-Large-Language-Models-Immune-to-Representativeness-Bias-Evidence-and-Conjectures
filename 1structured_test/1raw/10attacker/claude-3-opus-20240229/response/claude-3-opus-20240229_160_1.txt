To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A)) / (P(W1 and W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1 and W2|not A) × P(not A))

Assuming the witness statements are independent:
P(W1 and W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.80 × 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1 and W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / (0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2308
