To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

We want to calculate P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1, W2|A) × P(A)) / (P(W1, W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1, W2|not A) × P(not A))

Assuming the witnesses' claims are independent:
P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.80 × 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1, W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / (0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2308

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.2308 or 23.08%.
