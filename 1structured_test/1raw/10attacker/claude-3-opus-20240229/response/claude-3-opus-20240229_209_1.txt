To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' claims and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85) = 0.2449

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims and their accuracy, is approximately 0.2449 or 24.49%.
