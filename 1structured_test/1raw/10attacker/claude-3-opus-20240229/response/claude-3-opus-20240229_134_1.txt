To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We need to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.30 (the second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, errs 30% of the time)

Calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) × P(A) + P(B|not A) × P(not A)
     = 0.80 × 0.15 + 0.30 × 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.255
     = 0.375

Now, calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.80 × 0.15) / 0.375
       = 0.12 / 0.375
       = 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
