To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claimed the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B and C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B and C|A) * P(A) + P(B and C|not A) * P(not A))

P(B and C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(B and C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.24 * 0.15) / (0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85) = 0.2328

{probability: 0.2328}
