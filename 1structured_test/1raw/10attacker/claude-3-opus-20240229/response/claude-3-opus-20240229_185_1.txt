To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability that the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability that the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|not A) = 0.70 (probability that the second witness is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|A) = 0.30 (probability that the second witness is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims they are and the second witness claims they are not.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = P(B and C|A) * P(A) / [P(B and C|A) * P(A) + P(B and C|not A) * P(not A)]

P(B and C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(B and C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

P(A|B and C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / [0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.2308
