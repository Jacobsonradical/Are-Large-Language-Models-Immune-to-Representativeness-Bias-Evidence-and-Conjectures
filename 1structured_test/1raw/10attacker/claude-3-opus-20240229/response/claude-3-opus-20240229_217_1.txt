To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

We want to calculate P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            â‰ˆ 0.2449

Therefore, my estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2449}
