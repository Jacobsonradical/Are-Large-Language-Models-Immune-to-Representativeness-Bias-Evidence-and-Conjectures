To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1, W2|A) × P(A)) / (P(W1, W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1, W2|not A) × P(not A))

Assuming the witness statements are independent:
P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) = 0.80 × 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|not A) = P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1, W2) = (0.24 × 0.15) / (0.24 × 0.15 + 0.14 × 0.85) ≈ 0.2308

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2308 or 23.08%.
