To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller
W2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

Given:
P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness being wrong when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|not A) = 0.70 (probability of the second witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|A) = 0.30 (probability of the second witness being wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W1 and W2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) × P(A)) / (P(W1|A) × P(W2|A) × P(A) + P(W1|not A) × P(W2|not A) × P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|W1 and W2) = (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15) / (0.80 × 0.30 × 0.15 + 0.20 × 0.70 × 0.85)
               ≈ 0.2439

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.2439 or 24.39%.
