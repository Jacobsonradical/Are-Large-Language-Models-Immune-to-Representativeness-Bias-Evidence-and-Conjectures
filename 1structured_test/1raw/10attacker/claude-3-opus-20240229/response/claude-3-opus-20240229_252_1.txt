To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to calculate P(A|B,C), the probability of A given both B and C.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)

We know:
- P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness's accuracy for tall people)
- P(C|A) = 0.20 (second witness's error rate for tall people)
- P(B|not A) = 0.20 (first witness's error rate for short people)
- P(C|not A) = 0.70 (second witness's accuracy for short people)

Assuming the witnesses' claims are independent given the attacker's height:
P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.16
P(B,C|not A) = P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can calculate P(B,C):
P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) + P(B,C|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.16 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
= 0.024 + 0.119
= 0.143

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B,C):
P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)
= 0.16 * 0.15 / 0.143
â‰ˆ 0.168

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is approximately 0.168 or 16.8%.
