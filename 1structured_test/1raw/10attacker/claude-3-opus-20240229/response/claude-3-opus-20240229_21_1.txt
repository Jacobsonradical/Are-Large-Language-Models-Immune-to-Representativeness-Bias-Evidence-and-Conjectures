To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness's claim, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an individual being 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying the height when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))
       = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.
