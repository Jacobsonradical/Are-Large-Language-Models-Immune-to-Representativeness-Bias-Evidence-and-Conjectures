To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- C: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the population distribution)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(C|A) = 0.3 (second witness's error rate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|not A) = 0.7 (second witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B and C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B and C) = (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(C|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B and C) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85)
            â‰ˆ 0.2449

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is about 24.49%.
