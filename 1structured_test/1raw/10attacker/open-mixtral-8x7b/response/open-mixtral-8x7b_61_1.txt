Given the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on their conflicting statements. We will use Bayes' theorem, which can be written as:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From statement (a), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Since the witnesses' testimonies conflict, we can assume that one of them must be incorrect. We will first consider the scenario where the first witness is correct and the second is not. The probability of the first witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(B1|A) = 0.8, and the probability of the second witness being incorrect given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller is P(B2|not A) = 0.3.

The probabilities for the second scenario (first witness incorrect, second witness correct) are P(B1|not A) = 0.2 and P(B2|A) = 0.7.

Now, we will calculate the probability of both testimonies given the attacker's height:

P(B) = P((B1 and B2)|A) * P(A) + P((B1 and B2)|not A) * P(not A)

P(B1 and B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = (0.8) * (0.7) = 0.56
P(B1 and B2|not A) = P(B1|not A) * P(B2|not A) = (0.2) * (0.3) = 0.06

Now, we'll combine these probabilities with P(A) and P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85:

P(B) = (0.56 * 0.15) + (0.06 * 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135

Finally, we will use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.135 â‰ˆ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.667 (66.7%).
