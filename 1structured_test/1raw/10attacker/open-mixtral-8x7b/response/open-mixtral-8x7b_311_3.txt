Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making height judgments. The second witness is not as relevant to our estimation since they did not claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Instead of focusing on the population distribution, we should focus on the accuracy of the first witness's claim. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy rate for making such claims is 80%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
