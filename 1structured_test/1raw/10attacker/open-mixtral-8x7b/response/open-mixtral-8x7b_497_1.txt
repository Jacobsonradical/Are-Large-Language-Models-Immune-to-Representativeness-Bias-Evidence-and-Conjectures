Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed so. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim.

P(B|A) is the probability of witness 1 being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (A'). The probability of witness 1 being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
