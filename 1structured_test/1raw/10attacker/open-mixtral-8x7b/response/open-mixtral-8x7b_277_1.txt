Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probability using the first witness's claim only.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
4. Therefore, given the witness's reliability and the fact that they claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
