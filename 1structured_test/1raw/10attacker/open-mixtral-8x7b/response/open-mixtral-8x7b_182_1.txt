Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we will consider the first witness's statement. We are interested in the probability P(A), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(W1 is correct | A) * P(A) / P(W1 is correct)

P(W1 is correct | A) is the probability that the first witness is correct when stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80%.

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is what we want to find.

P(W1 is correct) is the overall probability that the first witness is correct. To calculate this, we need to find the weighted sum of the probabilities of the first witness being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (event ~A) and when the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A).

P(W1 is correct) = P(W1 is correct | A) * P(A) + P(W1 is correct | ~A) * P(~A)

We are given P(W1 is correct | A) as 80%, and we know P(A) from the city's population statistics: P(A) = 15%. Similarly, P(~A) = 85%.

To find P(W1 is correct | ~A), we need the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1 is correct | ~A) = 1 - P(W1 is incorrect | ~A) = 1 - 20% = 80%

Now we can calculate P(W1 is correct):

P(W1 is correct) = 80% * 15% + 80% * 85% = 0.645

Finally, we can find P(A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = P(W1 is correct | A) * P(A) / P(W1 is correct) = 80% * 15% / 64.5% â‰ˆ 0.186

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 18.6%.

Answer: {probability: 0.186}
