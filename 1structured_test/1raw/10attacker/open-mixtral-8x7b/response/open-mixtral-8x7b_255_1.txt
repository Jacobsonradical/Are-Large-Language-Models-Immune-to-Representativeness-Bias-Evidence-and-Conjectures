Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know is true 15% of the time in the general population.
3. However, the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is true 85% of the time in the general population.
5. But the second witness is only correct 70% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given these percentages, it seems more likely that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, since there's a higher chance that both witnesses would be correct together if that's the case. 

To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, we would need more information about how to combine their individual accuracy rates. However, without that information, we can't provide a precise estimate.
