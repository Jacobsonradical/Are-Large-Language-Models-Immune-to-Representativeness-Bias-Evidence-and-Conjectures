Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time with the same guess.

b) The city's population is 85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% is 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, both witnesses' statements are independent. Instead of focusing on their errors, let's calculate the probability of them being correct.

Witness 1 being correct: 0.8 (80% chance)
Witness 2 being correct: 0.7 (70% chance)

To find the combined probability of both witnesses being correct and stating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we multiply the individual probabilities:

Combined probability: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%

However, this doesn't account for the city's population distribution. Since the population is 15% 185 cm or taller, let's also calculate the probability of being correct just by guessing based on population statistics:

Witness 1 guessing based on population: 0.15 (15% chance)
Witness 2 guessing based on population: 0.15 (15% chance)

Combined probability based on population: 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.0225 or 2.25%

Since the witnesses' individual accuracy is higher than just guessing based on population, let's find a weighted probability using both the witnesses' accuracy and population statistics.

Weighted combined probability = (0.8 * 0.7) + (0.2 * 0.15 * 0.15) = 0.56 + 0.0045 = 0.5645 or 56.45%

Answer: {probability: 0.5645, or 56.45%}
