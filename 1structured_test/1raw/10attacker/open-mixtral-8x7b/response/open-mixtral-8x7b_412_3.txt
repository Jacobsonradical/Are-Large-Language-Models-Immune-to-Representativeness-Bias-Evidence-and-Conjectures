Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.8 (80%), and incorrect with a probability of 0.2 (20%).
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with a probability of 0.7 (70%), and incorrect with a probability of 0.3 (30%).
4. However, since Witness 2 thought the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, it means their claim is not relevant to our estimation of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. 
5. So, we only need to consider Witness 1's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, based on the information provided about Witness 1, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
