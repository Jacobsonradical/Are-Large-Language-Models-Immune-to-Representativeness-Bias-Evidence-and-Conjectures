Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement. 

For the first witness, the probability of them being correct is 80%, and the probability of them being incorrect is 20%. Since the witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's statement) = P(witness 1 is correct) = 0.8

For the second witness, the probability of them being correct is 70%, and the probability of them being incorrect is 30%. Since the second witness stated that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness 2's statement) = P(witness 2 is correct) = 0.7

Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements. We can use the formula for total probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's statement) * P(witness 1's statement) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's statement) * P(witness 2's statement)

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * P(witness 1's statement) + 0.15 * (1 - P(witness 2's statement))

We need to find P(witness 1's statement) and P(witness 2's statement), which are the probabilities of the first and second witness being correct, respectively. We can calculate these probabilities using the law of total probability:

P(witness 1's statement) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness 1's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness 1's statement | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(witness 1's statement) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.255 + 0.17 = 0.425

Similarly, for the second witness:

P(witness 2's statement) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness 2's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness 2's statement | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know that the second witness is correct 70% of the time, so:

P(witness 2's statement) = 0.15 * 0.3 + 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.425 + 0.15 * (1 - 0.64) = 0.34 + 0.051 = 0.391

The answer is:
{probability: 0.391}
