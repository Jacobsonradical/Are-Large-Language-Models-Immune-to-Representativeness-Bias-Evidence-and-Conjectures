To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's denote the event that the first witness is correct as A, and the event that the second witness is correct as B. We want to find the probability P(A), and we are given the probabilities P(A|A) = 0.8, P(A'|A) = 0.2, P(B|B) = 0.7, and P(B'|B) = 0.3. We are also given the probability P(B') = 0.85, which means that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B') = P(B'|A) \* P(A) / P(B')

We want to find P(A), so let's solve for it:

P(A) = P(B') \* P(A|B') / P(B'|A)

We are given P(B') = 0.85 and P(B'|A) = 0.2, so we need to find P(A|B').

To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(A|B') = P(A and B) / P(B') = P(A) \* P(B|A) / P(B')

We are given P(B|A) = 0.7, and we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(A and B) + P(A' and B) = P(A) \* P(B|A) + P(A') \* P(B|A') = 0.8 \* 0.7 + 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.64 + 0.06 = 0.7

Therefore, P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

P(A) = P(B') \* P(A|B') / P(B'|A) = 0.3 \* P(A) \* 0.7 / 0.2 = 1.05 \* P(A) / 0.2 = 5.25 \* P(A)

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 1 / 5.25 = 0.190476

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.19, or 19%.
