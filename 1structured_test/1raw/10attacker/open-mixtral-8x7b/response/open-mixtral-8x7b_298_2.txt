Let's analyze the given information:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) The population data shows that 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's statement:

1. Since Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability of this being true.
2. Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, we can calculate the probability as follows:
   - True positive rate: 80% * 15% = 12%
3. We don't need to account for Witness 2's accuracy because Witness 1's statement is not contradicted by Witness 2. Instead, Witness 2's statement affects the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
