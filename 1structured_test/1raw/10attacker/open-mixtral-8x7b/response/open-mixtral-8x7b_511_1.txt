Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, which we know is 80%. Similarly, the likelihood of the first witness being incorrect when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller is 20%.

We also know that the population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% taller or equal to 185 cm. Therefore, the likelihood of a random person actually being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, we need to multiply the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller (0.8) with the likelihood of a random person actually being 185 cm or taller (0.15). Similarly, we need to multiply the likelihood of the first witness being incorrect when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller (0.2) with the likelihood of a random person actually being shorter than 185 cm (0.85).

So, the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is:

0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, {probability: 0.29}
