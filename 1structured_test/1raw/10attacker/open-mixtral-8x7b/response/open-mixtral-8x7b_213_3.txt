Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Given the information, we cannot determine the exact height of the attacker, but we can calculate the probability based on the witnesses' testimonies.

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The second witness contradicts this claim, implying that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, there is a 70% chance that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm. However, since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, there is still a possibility that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Taking into account both witnesses' testimonies and their error rates, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let C represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so and the second witness claimed otherwise.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C)

First, we need to calculate P(B,C|A). This is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(B,C|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time in such cases, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(C|A) is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness errs 30% of the time in such cases, P(C|A) = 0.3.

Therefore, P(B,C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

Next, we need to calculate P(A). This is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to calculate P(B,C). This is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

P(B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) + P(B,C|A') * P(A')

Here, A' represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We already calculated P(B,C|A) = 0.24. Now we need to calculate P(B,C|A').

P(B,C|A') = P(B|A') * P(C|A')

P(B|A') is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time in such cases, P(B|A') = 0.2.

P(C|A') is the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time in such cases, P(C|A') = 0.7.

Therefore, P(B,C|A') = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Now, we can calculate P(B,C):

P(B,C) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B,C):

P(A|B,C) = P(B,C|A) * P(A) / P(B,C) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.2387

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 23.87%.
