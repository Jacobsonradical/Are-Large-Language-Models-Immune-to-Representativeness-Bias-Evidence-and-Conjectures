Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% accuracy rate when making such judgments.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% accuracy rate when making such judgments.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Here, A represents "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B represents "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We're looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

First, let's find P(B|A): the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

Next, let's find P(A): the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Now, we need to find P(B): the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This will be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
a) P(B|A) * P(A) (first witness correctly claims 185 cm or taller)
b) P(B|not A) * P(not A) (first witness mistakenly claims 185 cm or taller)

P(B|not A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 100% - 80% = 20%.

P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
