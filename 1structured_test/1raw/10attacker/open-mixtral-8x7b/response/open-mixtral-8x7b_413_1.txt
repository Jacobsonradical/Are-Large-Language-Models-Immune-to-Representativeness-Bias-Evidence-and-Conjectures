Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which they get right 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which they get right 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made this claim.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some terms:

- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- A': The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 made this claim. We can calculate this as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(B|A): The probability that Witness 1 makes this claim given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%.
- P(B): The probability that Witness 1 makes this claim, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is calculated as P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A').

We need to calculate P(B|A'): The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 - the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%. So P(B|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.8) * (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.80

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8) = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.15.
