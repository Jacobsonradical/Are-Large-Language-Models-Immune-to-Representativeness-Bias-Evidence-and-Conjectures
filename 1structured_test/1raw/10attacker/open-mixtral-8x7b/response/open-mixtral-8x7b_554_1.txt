Let's break down the given information:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, and assuming their testimonies are independent, we can calculate the probability using the first witness's claim and their ability to correctly identify the height.

The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is a correct identification 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.8 or 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
