Let's break down the given information and calculate the probability:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which would be correct 85% of the time given the population distribution. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses' claims being correct, given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(both correct) = P(first witness correct) x P(second witness correct | first witness correct)

P(first witness correct) = 0.8 (80% chance of the first witness being correct)

Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. In this case, the second witness would be correct 80% of the time (reversing the 85% and 15% population distribution).

P(second witness correct | first witness correct) = 0.8 (80% chance of the second witness being correct, given the first witness's claim)

P(both correct) = 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64 (64%)

However, we must also consider the possibility that the second witness is correct while the first witness is incorrect, as the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:

P(first incorrect, second correct) = P(first incorrect) x P(second correct | first incorrect)

P(first incorrect) = 1 - P(first correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20% chance of the first witness being incorrect)

Given that the first witness is incorrect, there is a 85% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. In this case, the second witness would be correct 70% of the time (based on their overall accuracy).

P(second correct | first incorrect) = 0.7 (70% chance of the second witness being correct, given the first witness's incorrect claim)

P(first incorrect, second correct) = 0.2 x 0.7 = 0.14 (14%)

Now let's find the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' claims:

P(attacker 185 cm or taller) = P(both correct) + P(first incorrect, second correct) = 0.64 + 0.14 = 0.78 (78%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.78}.
