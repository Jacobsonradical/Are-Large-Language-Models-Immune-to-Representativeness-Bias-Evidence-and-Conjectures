Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony doesn't help us here.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller.
4. However, we also know that only 15% of the population in this city meets this description, which decreases our confidence in the first witness's statement.
5. To calculate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
6. In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".
7. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
8. P(A) is the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
9. P(B) is the probability that the first witness would say a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.80)*(0.15) + (0.20)*(0.85) = 0.255
10. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get: P(A|B) = (0.80)*(0.15) / (0.255) â‰ˆ 0.4706

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4706 (47.06%).
