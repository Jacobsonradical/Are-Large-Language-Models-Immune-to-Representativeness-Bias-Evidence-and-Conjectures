Let's consider the following events:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness correctly identified the attacker's height.
C: The second witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

From the problem statement, we are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(C|A) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(C|A') = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

First, let's calculate P(B). We can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We know P(B|A), P(A), P(B|A') and P(A') (since P(A') = 1 - P(A)). We can now compute P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Format answer: {probability: 0.4138}
