Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

Given this information, it seems more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller since Witness 1, who made this claim, has a higher rate of correct identification. However, we can't make a definitive conclusion without further calculations.

Let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses. We'll use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that both witnesses gave conflicting testimonies.

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|A) is the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.20 (100% - 80%, the rate at which Witness 1 is correct).
- P(B|not A) is the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.30 (30% of the time, the rate at which Witness 2 errs).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / [(0.20 * 0.15) + (0.30 * 0.85)] = 0.03 / (0.03 + 0.255) = 0.03 / 0.285 â‰ˆ 0.105

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.105 or 10.5%. Please note that this calculation assumes that the two witnesses' testimonies are independent events, which may not be the case in reality.
