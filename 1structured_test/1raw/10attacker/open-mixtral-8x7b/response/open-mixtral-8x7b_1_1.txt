Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify a person as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.
4. Since the second witness contradicts the first, we can use the second witness's error rate to adjust our estimate.
5. The second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time, and since only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this means the actual probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, given the second witness's statement, is 15 * (1 - 0.3) = 0.105 or 10.5%.
6. However, since the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time, we can adjust our estimate based on this information.
7. So, the final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.105 * 0.8 = 0.084 or 8.4%.

{probability: 0.084}
