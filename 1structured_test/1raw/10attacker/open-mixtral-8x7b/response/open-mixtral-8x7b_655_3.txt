Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but their testimony is not always accurate. Similarly, the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but their testimony is also not always accurate.

We'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability, which states that:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence we've obtained from the two witnesses.

First, let's compute P(B|A), which is the probability of observing the evidence (witness testimonies) given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by finding the probability that the first witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is incorrect when they say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.12

Next, we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of observing the evidence given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm). This can be calculated by finding the probability that the first witness is incorrect when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is correct when they say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 * 0.7 = 0.07

Now, we need to find P(A), which is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller based on the population data:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

Similarly, we need to find P(not A), which is the prior probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., they are shorter than 185 cm):

P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population)

Finally, we need to compute P(B), which is the probability of observing the evidence regardless of the attacker's height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

However, computing P(B) requires knowing the precise probabilities of the witnesses' testimonies, which is not explicitly stated. We can estimate P(B) using our computed values for P(B|A) and P(B|not A) and assuming the two events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive:

P(B) ≈ P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.07 * 0.85 ≈ 0.027 + 0.0595 ≈ 0.0865

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) ≈ 0.12 * 0.15 / 0.0865 ≈ 0.2157

However, this value should be taken as an approximation, since the calculation of P(B) is based on assumptions.

Answer: {probability: 0.2157}
