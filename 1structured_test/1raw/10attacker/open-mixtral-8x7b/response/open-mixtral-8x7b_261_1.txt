Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

Given these facts, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller since Witness 1, who made that claim, has a higher accuracy rate (80%) compared to Witness 2 (70%).

However, to provide an estimated probability, we need to consider both witnesses' statements and their respective error rates. We can do this by calculating the probability of both witnesses being correct, given their individual error rates.

The probability of Witness 1 being correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.8 (80%). The probability of Witness 2 being correct (attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.7 (70%). Since these are independent events, we multiply their probabilities to get the combined probability:

0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%

But this calculation assumes that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. To account for the possibility that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we also need to calculate the reverse scenario:

The probability of Witness 1 being incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.2 (20%). The probability of Witness 2 being incorrect (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.3 (30%). Again, since these are independent events, we multiply their probabilities:

0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%

Now, to find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as Witness 1 claimed, we add the probabilities of both scenarios where Witness 1 is correct:

0.56 (Witnesses 1 and 2 are both correct) + 0.06 (Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect) = 0.62 or 62%

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.62}
