Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, since they correctly identified the height 80% of the time, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is:

P(tall | W1) = 0.8 * 0.5 (given that there is a 50/50 chance of the attacker being tall or short)
P(tall | W1) = 0.4

For the second witness, since they correctly identified the height 70% of the time, the probability of the attacker being 1
