Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating whether someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means they identified the attacker as being in the group that is 100% shorter than 185 cm according to their statement (no one in this group is 185 cm or taller). Since this witness is correct 70% of the time, this implies that there's a 70% chance that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm based on the second witness's testimony.
3. Therefore, there's a 30% chance that the second witness is wrong, meaning there's a 30% chance that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller despite the second witness's claim.
4. Now, we have two independent pieces of evidence about the attacker's height. To combine them, we multiply the probabilities. So, the combined probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses, is 0.8 (probability from the first witness) * 0.3 (probability from the second witness) = 0.24 or 24%.

{probability: 0.24}
