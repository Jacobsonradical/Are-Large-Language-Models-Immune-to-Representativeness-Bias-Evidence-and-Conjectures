To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- P(B1) is the probability that the first witness is correct
- P(B2) is the probability that the first witness is incorrect
- P(A|B1) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness is correct
- P(A|B2) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness is incorrect

We are given:
- P(A|B1) = 1 (since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1) = 0.8 (since the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A|B2) = 0.15 / 0.2 = 0.75 (since the population is 15% 185 cm or taller and the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(B2) = 0.2 (since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)
= 1 * 0.8 + 0.75 * 0.2
= 0.8 + 0.15
= 0.95

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.95 or 95%.
