Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. That means when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, their statement is correct 80% of the time. So, we can multiply our prior probability (15%) by the witness's accuracy (80%) to find out the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time. That means when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm, their statement is correct 70% of the time. So, we can multiply our prior probability (15%) by the second witness's inaccuracy (1-0.70 = 0.30) to find out the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given the second witness's statement.
4. Since both witnesses' statements contradict each other, we can assume their statements are independent events. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on both witnesses' statements by multiplying the probabilities from steps 2 and 3.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

1. Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement: 15% * 80% = 12%
2. Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the second witness's statement: 15% * 30% = 4.5%
3. Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements: 12% + 4.5% = 16.5%

However, since the second witness's statement contradicts the first witness, we should consider the probability that the second witness is correct despite the first witness's claim.

1. Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm based on the second witness's statement: 85% * 70% = 59.5%

Now, we can calculate the final probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' statements:

1. Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller: Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement AND the second witness's statement = 12% * 59.5% = 7.14%

{probability: 7.14%}
