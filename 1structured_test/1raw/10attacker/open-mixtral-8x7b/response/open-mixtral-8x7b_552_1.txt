Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker being in the taller 15% of the population.
3. However, Witness 1 makes errors 20% of the time, so there's a chance they could be mistaken.
4. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with the attacker being in the shorter 85% of the population.
5. But Witness 2 also makes errors 30% of the time, so there's a chance they could be mistaken too.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B1 as the event that Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2 as the event that Witness 2 said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate P(A|B1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 said so.

From the problem:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 incorrectly claims the person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they aren't)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
â‰ˆ 0.45

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, is approximately 0.45 or 45%.
