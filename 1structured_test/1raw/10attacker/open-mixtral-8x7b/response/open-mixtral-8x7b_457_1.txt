Let's reason through this:

We know that one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that this particular witness said so. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- F as the event that the witness said the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(E|F), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(E|F) = P(F|E) * P(E) / P(F)

- P(F|E) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim, P(F|E) = 0.8
- P(E) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(F) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is or not.

To calculate P(F), we can use the law of total probability: P(F) = P(F and E) + P(F and not E) = P(F|E) * P(E) + P(F|not E) * P(not E)

- P(F|not E) is the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not. This is the false positive rate, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the witness is wrong 30% of the time when making this claim)
- P(not E) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population)

So, P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now, we can calculate P(E|F):

P(E|F) = P(F|E) * P(E) / P(F) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 = 0.32

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.32.
