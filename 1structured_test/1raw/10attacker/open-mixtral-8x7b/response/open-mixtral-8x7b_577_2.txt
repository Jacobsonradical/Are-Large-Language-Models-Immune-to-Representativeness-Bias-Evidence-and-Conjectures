To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. We will consider two cases: the first witness is correct and the second witness is correct.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- W1 as the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- W2 as the event that the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, P(A) = 0.15, P(W1|A) = 0.8, P(W2|¬A) = 0.7, and P(¬A) = 0.85, where ¬A is the complementary event of A.

First, find P(W2|A), the probability that the second witness would claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(W2|A) = 1 - P(W1|A) = 0.2

Now, we can find the conditional probability P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A))

To compute P(W1|¬A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, we can use the complementary probability:

P(W1|¬A) = 1 - P(W2|¬A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.2308

The final answer is: {probability: 0.2308}
