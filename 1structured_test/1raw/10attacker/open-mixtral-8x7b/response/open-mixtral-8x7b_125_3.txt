Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification 70% of the time.

Given these facts, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, as both witnesses' claims align with their higher accuracy rates for identifying taller individuals.

To calculate an exact probability, we would need to know the joint probability of both witnesses being correct given their individual accuracy rates. However, without knowing the base accuracy rates for each witness, we cannot calculate this joint probability. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

However, since both witnesses' claims align with their higher accuracy rates for identifying taller individuals, it is reasonable to say that the probability is greater than 0.5 (or 50%).

Answer: {probability: >0.5}
