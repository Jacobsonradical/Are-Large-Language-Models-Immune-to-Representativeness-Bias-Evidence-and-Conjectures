Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the testimony of the first witness.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. In the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
5. Thus, the probability that the first witness is correct AND the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%).
6. The probability that the first witness is incorrect AND the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 (or 17%).
7. Since these are the only two possibilities, we can add them together to get the total probability: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.29}
