Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs in 30% of the cases.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- not A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (second witness's error rate)
- P(A) = 0.15 (population statistic)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.319

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.319.
