Let's reason through this problem:

We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. The first witness can correctly identify someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and the second witness can do so 70% of the time.

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the combined accuracy of the two witnesses' testimonies.

There are four possible combinations of the witnesses' testimonies:
1. Both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, while the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, while the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. Both witnesses claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability of scenario 1, given that at least one witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, their combined accuracy when both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 (or 56%).

Since the first witness is more accurate than the second, we can assume that if there is a discrepancy between their testimonies, the first witness is more likely to be correct. This means scenario 2 is more probable than scenario 3.

Now let's calculate the probability of scenario 2 occurring:
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8 probability).
- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.3 probability).

The probability of scenario 2 is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (or 24%).

Now we need to find the probability of scenario 1 and scenario 2 both occurring:

The probability of both witnesses claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the probability of scenario 1 (0.56) plus the probability of scenario 2 (0.24), which is 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.80 (or 80%).

Since we're looking for the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we can conservatively estimate that the probability is equal to the combined accuracy of scenario 1 and scenario 2, which is 0.56 (the accuracy of scenario 1).

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.56}.
