Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1=correct) = 0.8
P(W2=correct) = 0.7

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

P(A185cm) = 0.15

Now, we need to calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, assuming the first witness is correct (A185cm) and the probability of both witnesses being correct assuming the first witness is incorrect (not A185cm):

P(W1=correct, W2=correct | A185cm) = P(W1=correct) * P(W2=correct | A185cm)
= 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

P(W1=correct, W2=correct | not A185cm) = P(W1=correct | not A185cm) * P(W2=correct | not A185cm)
= 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now we calculate the overall probability of both witnesses being correct and the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(W1=correct, W2=correct, A185cm) = P(A185cm) * P(W1=correct, W2=correct | A185cm)
= 0.15 * 0.56 = 0.084

Finally, we calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses are correct:

P(A185cm | W1=correct, W2=correct) = P(W1=correct, W2=correct, A185cm) / P(W1=correct, W2=correct)

To calculate P(W1=correct, W2=correct), we need to consider all possible combinations:

P(A185cm, W1=correct, W2=correct) + P(not A185cm, W1=correct, W2=correct)
= 0.084 + P(not A185cm) * P(W1=correct, W2=correct | not A185cm)
= 0.084 + (1 - 0.15) * 0.06
= 0.084 + 0.054
= 0.138

Then, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses are correct is:

P(A185cm | W1=correct, W2=correct) = 0.084 / 0.138 â‰ˆ 0.6087

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6087}
