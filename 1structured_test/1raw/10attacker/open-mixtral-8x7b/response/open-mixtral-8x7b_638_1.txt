Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness. We can't use the second witness's statement to support the first witness's claim directly.
3. Instead, let's consider the accuracy of each witness. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, and wrong 20% of the time.
4. The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% based on the city's population.
5. We can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

Posterior probability = P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

6. Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
7. The term P(B|A) is the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
8. The term P(A) is the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
9. The term P(B) requires us to consider two scenarios: the first witness is correct, and the first witness is incorrect. We can calculate this probability as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

10. The term P(B|not A) is the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (since they have an 80% chance of being correct, and in this case, they are incorrect).
11. The term P(not A) is the prior probability of an attacker not being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85.
12. Now we can compute P(B):

P(B) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] + [(0.2) * (0.85)] = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

13. Finally, we can compute the posterior probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
