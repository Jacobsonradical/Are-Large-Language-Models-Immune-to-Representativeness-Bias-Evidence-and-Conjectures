To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- C as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm,
- P(A) as the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city's population,
- P(B|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- P(B|A') as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller,
- P(C|A) as the probability that the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- P(C'|A') as the probability that the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (prime denotes complementary events).

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller),
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller),
- P(B|A') = 0.20 (the first witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller),
- P(C|A) = 0.30 (the second witness erred in 30% of the cases when the person is 185 cm or taller),
- P(C'|A') = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height about 70% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller).

Now, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

We have:
- P(B|A) = 0.80,
- P(A) = 0.15,
- P(B|A') = 0.20,
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So,

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
