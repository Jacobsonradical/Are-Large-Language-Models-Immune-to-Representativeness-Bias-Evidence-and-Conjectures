Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 correct) = 80% = 0.8
P(W2 correct) = 70% = 0.7

Since the two events are conditionally independent (given the attacker's height), we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct:

P(W1 correct and W2 correct) = P(W1 correct) * P(W2 correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

However, the two witnesses have contradictory statements. So, we also need to calculate the probability of both witnesses being incorrect (the first one saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second one saying the attacker was shorter than 1
