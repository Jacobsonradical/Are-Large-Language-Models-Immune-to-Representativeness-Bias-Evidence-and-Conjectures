Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. The first witness correctly identifies people who are 185cm or taller 80% of the time (and errs 20%).
4. According to the city's statistics, 15% of the population is 185cm or taller.
5. So, when the first witness claims that an attacker is 185cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're correct (and a 20% chance they're mistaken).

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
