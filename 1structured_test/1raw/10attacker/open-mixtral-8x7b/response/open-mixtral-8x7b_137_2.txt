Let's break down the information given:

1. City statistics: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness reliability: The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

We are interested in the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(A) = 15% and P(B|A) = 80%. To find P(B), we need to consider the two possibilities for the second witness's claim:

a) The second witness agrees with the first, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The probability of this event is 0.15 * 0.7 = 0.105 (10.5%).
b) The second witness disagrees with the first, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this event is 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255 (25.5%).

So, P(B) = 0.105 + 0.255 = 0.36 (36%).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.36
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.311 (31.1%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 31.1%.
