Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time in the general population.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which happens 85% of the time in the general population.
5. This second witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 30% of the time.
6. Since the second witness claims the attacker was shorter, and they are correct 70% of the time when making that claim, this suggests that the actual probability of the attacker being shorter is 85% * 0.7 = 59.5%.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 100% - 59.5% = 40.5%.

So, {probability: 0.405}
