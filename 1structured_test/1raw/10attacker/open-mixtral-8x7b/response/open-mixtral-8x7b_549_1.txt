Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
b) The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.
c) In the city's population, 15% are 185 cm or taller and 85% are shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

We need to find P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the evidence from the first witness.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:
P(B|A) = 1 (the witness is always correct when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') (total probability of B)
P(B|A') = 0.2 (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is not 185 cm or taller)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.4688

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4688}
