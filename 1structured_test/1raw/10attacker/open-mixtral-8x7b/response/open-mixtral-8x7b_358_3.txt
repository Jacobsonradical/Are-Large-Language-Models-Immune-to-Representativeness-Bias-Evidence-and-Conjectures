Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies this, which occurs with a probability of 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) times 0.8 (probability of the witness being correct), which is 0.12 or 12%.

However, this can also happen when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which occurs with a probability of 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) times 0.2 (probability of the witness being incorrect), which is 0.17 or 17%.

Therefore, the total probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 12% + 17% = 29%.

So, {probability: 0.29}
