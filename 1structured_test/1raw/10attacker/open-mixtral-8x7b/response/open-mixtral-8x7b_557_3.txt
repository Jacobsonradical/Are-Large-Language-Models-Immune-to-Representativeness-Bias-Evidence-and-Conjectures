Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on witness 1's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness 1 is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller). Instead, we can calculate the probability of the opposite event, P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and then subtract it from 1.

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(witness 2 is correct | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) + P(witness 2 is incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(witness 2 is correct | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7 (witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

We also know that P(witness 2 is incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(witness 2 is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 (witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).

Now, we can calculate P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm):

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7 * 0.85 + 0.7 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.595

Finally, we can calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim):

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.595) = 0.328

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.328 (32.8%).
