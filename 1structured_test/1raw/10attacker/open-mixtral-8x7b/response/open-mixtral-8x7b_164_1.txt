Let's break down the information given:

1. The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim)

= P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

Since witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height, P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) is always 1.

Thus, we need to calculate:

P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller)

= P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller GIVEN attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

= 0.8 * 0.15

= 0.12

Now, we need to calculate the probability of the opposite scenario:

P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller GIVEN attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= 0.2 * 0.85

= 0.17

Finally, we calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim)

= P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

= 0.12 / 0.29

= 0.4137931 (rounded to seven decimal places)

Format answer: {probability: 0.4137931}

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4137931.
