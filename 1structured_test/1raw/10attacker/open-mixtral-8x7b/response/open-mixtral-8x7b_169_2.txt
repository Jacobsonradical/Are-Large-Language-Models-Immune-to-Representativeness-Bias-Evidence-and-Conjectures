Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller and mistaken 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since we have no reason to favor one witness over the other, we'll treat both statements as independent events.
5. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm and mistaken 30% of the time.
6. The probability that both witnesses are correct can be calculated as the product of their individual accuracies: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%.
7. However, since the second witness contradicts the first, we're interested in the probability that the first witness is correct and the second is not.
8. The probability that the first witness is correct and the second is not can be calculated as the product of the first witness's accuracy and the second witness's inaccuracy: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 or 24%.
9. Therefore, given the information and assumptions, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, to be 24%.

{probability: 0.24}
