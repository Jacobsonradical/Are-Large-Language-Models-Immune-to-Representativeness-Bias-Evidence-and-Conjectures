Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height.
2. Witness 1 claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know the distribution of heights in the city's population, with 85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% being 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = 0.8 (since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)

However, we can't directly use Witness 2's testimony to calculate the probability since they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Instead, we can find the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller given Witness 2's testimony:

P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (since Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and this is the complementary probability)

Now, using the law of total probability, we can combine both probabilities:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) * P(Witness 1) + P(Attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) * P(Witness 2)

Since we don't have specific information about the reliability of each witness or the probability of each witness being correct, let's assume that both witnesses have an equal chance of being selected:

P(Witness 1) = P(Witness 2) = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.3 * 0.5) = 0.65

{probability: 0.65}
