To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from part b)
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (from part a, the first witness's ability to correctly identify a person who is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 20% = 0.2 (from part a, the first witness's error rate for people who are shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬A) = 85% = 0.85 (from part b, the proportion of the population who are shorter than 185 cm)

We can now calculate P(¬B), the probability that the first witness did not claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(¬B) = P(¬B|A) * P(A) + P(¬B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85
= 0.03 + 0.255
= 0.285

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.5 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.425
= 0.545

So, P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.545 ≈ 0.22

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.22}.
