Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making such claims.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making such claims.

We want to find the probability that the first witness is correct, given their claim and the error rates of both witnesses.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In our case:
- Event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "Both witnesses' claims are true."

We are interested in finding P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses' claims are true.

We know the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21 (second witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.21 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.3968

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3968 or 39.68%.
