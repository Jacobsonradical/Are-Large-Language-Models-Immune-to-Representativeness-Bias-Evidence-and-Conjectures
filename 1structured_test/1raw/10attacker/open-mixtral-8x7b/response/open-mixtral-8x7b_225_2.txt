Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which contradicts the second witness's statement.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.
4. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm.

Given these probabilities, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct simultaneously:
- Since one witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the other claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, it is impossible for both witnesses to be correct at the same time with their given statements.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0}

The two witnesses' statements contradict each other, and thus, they cannot both be correct.
