Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height (shorter than 185 cm) 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)
P(A) = 0.15 (proportion of population that is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and when it is shorter than 185 cm. We can write:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8
P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

To find P(B|not A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B|not A) = P(B and not A) / P(not A)

We need to find the probability of the second witness being correct, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255 (probability of the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Thus,

P(B|not A) = P(B and not A) / P(not A) = 0.255 / 0.85 ≈ 0.3

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 ≈ 0.395

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.395 ≈ 0.309

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.309}
