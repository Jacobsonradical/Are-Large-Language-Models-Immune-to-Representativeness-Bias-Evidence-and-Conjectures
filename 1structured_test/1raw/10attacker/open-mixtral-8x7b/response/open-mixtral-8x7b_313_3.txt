1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony doesn't help us in this case.
3. The first witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time (according to the information provided).
4. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness made an error and the attacker was actually shorter than 1
