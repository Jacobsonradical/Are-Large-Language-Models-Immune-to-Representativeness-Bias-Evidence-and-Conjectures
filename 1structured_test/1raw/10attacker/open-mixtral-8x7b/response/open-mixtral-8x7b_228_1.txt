Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 30% of the time.
4. Since both witnesses have contradictory statements, they can't both be right. So, either the attacker was 185 cm or taller, or they were shorter than 185 cm.
5. We want to find the probability that the first witness is correct, i.e., the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
6. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case would be:
   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's statement) = P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1's statement)
7. We're given P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the accuracy of the first witness when the person is actually 185 cm or taller) and P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
8. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(Witness 1's statement), which would require knowing the overall accuracy of the first witness, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

Therefore, without more information, it's impossible to provide a precise estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement.
