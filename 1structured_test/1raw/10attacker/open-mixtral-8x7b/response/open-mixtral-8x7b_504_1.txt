To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we have:
- P(B|A): The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A): From the city's demographics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15
- P(B): To find this, we need to find the probabilities of B when the attacker's height is both shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller, and then sum them:
  - P(B|A'): The second witness contradicts the first, so this is the case where the first witness is wrong. The second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|A') = 0.3
  - P(A'): From the city's demographics, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(A') = 0.85

Using the law of total probability, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.255

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.467
