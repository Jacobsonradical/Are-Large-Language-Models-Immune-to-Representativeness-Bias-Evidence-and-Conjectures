Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we need to calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct in their statements, given their error rates.
5. The probability of Witness 1 being correct is 0.8 (80%), while the probability of Witness 2 being correct is 0.7 (70%).
6. However, we cannot simply multiply these probabilities together, because the two events are not independent; if Witness 1 is correct, then Witness 2 must be incorrect.
7. Instead, we need to calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given that Witness 2 is incorrect.
8. The probability that Witness 2 is incorrect is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (30%).
9. Given that Witness 2 is incorrect, we want to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct.
10. Since there are only two possibilities (either both witnesses are correct, or only Witness 1 is correct), the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given that Witness 2 is incorrect, is 1 - the probability that both witnesses are correct, which is 1 - (0.8 * 0.3) = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76.

In the format requested, the answer is: {probability: 0.76}
