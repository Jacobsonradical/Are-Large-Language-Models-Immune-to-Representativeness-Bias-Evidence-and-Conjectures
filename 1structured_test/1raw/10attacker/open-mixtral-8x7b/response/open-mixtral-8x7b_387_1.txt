Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To calculate this, we need to consider both witnesses' statements and weigh them according to their reliability.

Let's assume that the first witness's claim is true. We need to find the probability of the second witness's error given that the first witness's claim is true. We can calculate this using Bayes' theorem:

P(Error2 | True1) = P(True1 | Error2) * P(Error2) / P(True1)

We know the following probabilities:
- P(True1) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)
- P(Error2) = 0.3 (second witness's error rate)
- P(True1 | Error2) = 0.5 (given that the second witness erred, there's a 50% chance the first witness is correct, as there are equal numbers of people below and above 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(Error2 | True1):

P(Error2 | True1) = 0.5 * 0.3 / 0.8 = 0.1875

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

P(185+ | W1, W2) = P(W2Error | W1, 185+) * P(185+)

We know the following probabilities:
- P(W2Error | W1, 185+) = 0.1875 (calculated above)
- P(185+) = 0.15 (population distribution)

So, P(185+ | W1, W2) = 0.1875 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.028125 or 2.81%

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 2.81%.
