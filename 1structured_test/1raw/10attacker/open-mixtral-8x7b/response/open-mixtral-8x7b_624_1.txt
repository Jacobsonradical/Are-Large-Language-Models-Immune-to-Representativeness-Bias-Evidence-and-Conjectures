Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making this claim.
4. To calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we need to find the probability that both witnesses make a correct estimation.
5. The probability of both events happening (Witness 1 correct and Witness 2 incorrect) is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
