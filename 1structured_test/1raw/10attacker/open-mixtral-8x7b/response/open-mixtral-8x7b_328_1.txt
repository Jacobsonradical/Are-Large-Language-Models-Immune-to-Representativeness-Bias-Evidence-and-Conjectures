Let's break down the given information:

1. We don't know the exact height of the attacker, but we have two conflicting witness accounts.
2. Witness 1, who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some observed evidence (E) is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E)

In this case, our hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and our observed evidence (E) is the first witness's statement.

First, let's calculate P(E|H), the probability of the first witness making that statement given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making such statements, we have:

P(E|H) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate P(H), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, 15% of the population falls into this category:

P(H) = 0.15

Now, we need to calculate P(E), the total probability of the first witness making that statement. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller and the witness being correct, and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the witness being incorrect:

P(E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] + [P(E|~H) * P(~H)]

We already know P(E|H) and P(H). To calculate P(E|~H), the probability of the first witness making that statement given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we can use the complementary probability P(~E|H), which is the probability of the first witness making an incorrect statement when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(~E|H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Since the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm 85% of the time, we have:

P(~H) = 0.85

Now we can find P(E|~H):

P(E|~H) = P(~E|H) * P(~H) / P(~H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.17 * 0.85] = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now we can find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) * P(H)] / P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4536

{probability: 0.4536}
