Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a judgment.
4. The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. This second witness is correct 70% of the time when making such a judgment.
5. Given that these two witnesses have conflicting statements, we can consider the second witness as providing no useful information in this case since they contradict each other.
6. So, we will base our estimate solely on the statement of the first witness, who is correct 80% of the time when saying a person is 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
