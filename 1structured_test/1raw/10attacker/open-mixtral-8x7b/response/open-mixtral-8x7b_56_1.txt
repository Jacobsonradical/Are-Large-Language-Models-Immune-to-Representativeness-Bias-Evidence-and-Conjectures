To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. Here, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the given information, we know that:
- P(B|A): The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases:
1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A), and the first witness claims correctly with a probability of 0.8, or
2. The attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (event ~A), and the first witness claims incorrectly with a probability of 0.2 (1 - 0.8)

Thus, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

From the problem description, we don't have direct information about P(B|~A). However, we can infer it using the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time. Therefore, P(B|~A) = 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.595

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.595 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.5055
= 0.6255

Now, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.6255
= 0.1823

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1823 or 18.23%.
