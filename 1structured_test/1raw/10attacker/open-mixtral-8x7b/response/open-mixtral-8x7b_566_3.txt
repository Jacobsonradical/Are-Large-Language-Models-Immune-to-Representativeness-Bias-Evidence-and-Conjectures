Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height (shorter than 185 cm) 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the attacker was described as being seen from behind, it is reasonable to assume that the witnesses made their judgments based on the height of the person in front of them, rather than estimating the height from behind. This is important because it reduces the chance of the second witness making an error by overestimating the height of a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

If the first witness is correct, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 80%. However, if the first witness is incorrect, the second witness would have to be correct in their judgment that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time when judging a height of someone shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given that the first witness is incorrect, is 70%.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is more likely to be correct due to the conditions of the observation, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, to be around:

{probability: 0.92, or 92%}

This estimate is based on the idea that the first witness has a higher probability of being correct due to their higher accuracy rate, while still taking into account the possibility of the second witness being correct when judging a shorter height.
