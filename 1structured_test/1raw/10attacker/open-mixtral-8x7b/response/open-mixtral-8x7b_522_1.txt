Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller and is incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but since their statement contradicts the first witness, we will not use this information for our current estimation.

Now let's calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness's statement)
= P(First Witness is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(First Witness says Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
= (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
