Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making a judgement under poor lighting conditions.
4. So, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller AND the witness correctly identified this.
5. The probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.
6. Therefore, the probability is 0.15 (naturally occurring rate) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
