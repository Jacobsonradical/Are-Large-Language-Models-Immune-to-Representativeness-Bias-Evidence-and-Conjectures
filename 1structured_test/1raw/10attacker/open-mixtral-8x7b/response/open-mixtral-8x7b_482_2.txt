Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185) = Probability that the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the first witness says so
= (Probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller) * (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies an 185cm or taller person)
+ (Probability that the attacker is not 185cm or taller) * (Probability that the first witness mistakenly identifies a shorter person as 185cm or taller)

Given that 15% of the population is 185cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifies such individuals 80% of the time, the first term is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm and the first witness mistakenly identifies a shorter person as 185cm or taller 20% of the time, the second term is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

So, P(A185) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

{probability: 0.29}
