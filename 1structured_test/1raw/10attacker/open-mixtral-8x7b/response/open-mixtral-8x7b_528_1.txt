To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B1) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so
- P(B1) is the probability that the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B2) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it is shorter
- P(B2) is the probability that the first witness claimed the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- P(A|B1) = 1 (since the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A|B2) = 0.15 (probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it is shorter, which is the complementary probability to the second witness's correctness)
- P(B2) = 1 - P(B1) = 0.2 (the first witness claimed the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which happens 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 + 0.8 * P(A|B1) = 0.15 + 0.8 = 0.95 (using the total probability formula)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
