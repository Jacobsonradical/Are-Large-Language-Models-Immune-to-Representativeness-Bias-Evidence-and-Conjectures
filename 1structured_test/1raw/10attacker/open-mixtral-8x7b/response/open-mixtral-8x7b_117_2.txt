Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8. We also need to calculate the probability of the second witness correctly identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the probability that a randomly chosen attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

To find the probability that the first witness is correct, we need to consider the two possible scenarios - the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The probability that the first witness is correct is:

P(first witness is correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(first witness correct for 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(first witness correct for attacker shorter than 185 cm)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85. We also know that P(first witness correct for 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(first witness correct for attacker shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(first witness is correct) = 0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is the probability that the first witness is correct, which is 0.29 or 29%.
