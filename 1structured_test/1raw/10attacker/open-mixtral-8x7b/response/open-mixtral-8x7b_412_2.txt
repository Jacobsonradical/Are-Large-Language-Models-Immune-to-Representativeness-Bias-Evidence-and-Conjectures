Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%. So, when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're correct (0.8) and a 20% chance they're wrong (0.2).
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%. So, when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance they're correct (0.7) and a 30% chance they're wrong (0.3).

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
