Let's reason through this:

We know that one witness, who is correct 80% of the time, said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We'll use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller given this testimony.

Let's denote:
T = The event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller
A = The event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|T), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|T) = P(T|A) * P(A) / P(T)

1. P(T|A): The probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they actually are. This is the same as the witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

2. P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to point b, this is 15%.

3. P(T): The probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two probabilities: P(T and A) and P(T and not A), which are P(T|A) * P(A) and P(T|not A) * P(not A) respectively. 

   P(T|not A) is the false positive rate of the first witness, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%).
   P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85%).

So, P(T) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, P(A|T) = P(T|A) * P(A) / P(T) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
