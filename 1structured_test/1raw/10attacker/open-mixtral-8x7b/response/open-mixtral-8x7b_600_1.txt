Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185) = 0.8 (probability of first witness correctly identifying someone 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:

P(A<185) = 0.7 (probability of second witness correctly identifying someone shorter than 185cm)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, we can calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person actually being 185cm or taller:

P(185) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A185|W185) = P(W185|A185) * P(A185) / P(W185)

We know P(W185|A185) from the first witness's accuracy, and P(A185) from the population data. To calculate P(W185), we need to consider both scenarios - the attacker being 185cm or taller, and the attacker being shorter than 185cm:

P(W185) = P(W185|A185) * P(A185) + P(W185|A<185) * P(A<185)

Using the given data, we can calculate:

P(W185) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(A185|W185) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 = 0.32

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
