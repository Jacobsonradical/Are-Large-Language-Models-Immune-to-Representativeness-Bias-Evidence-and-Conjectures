Let's break down the given information and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these two pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 15% = 0.15
P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (probability that the first witness is correct)
P(B|not A) = 20% = 0.2 (probability that the first witness errs)
P(not A) = 85% = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4762

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4762}
