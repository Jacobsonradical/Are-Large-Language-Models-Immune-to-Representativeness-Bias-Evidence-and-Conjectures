Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when someone is 185 cm or taller.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but since their statement contradicts the first witness, we can discard this information.
5. To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem.
6. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
7. We want to find P(A|E), the probability of A given E.
8. Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
9. P(E|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
10. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
11. P(E) is the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the sum of the probabilities of the first witness saying so when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the probabilities of the first witness saying so when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller.
12. P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
13. P(E|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%).
14. P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.85 (85%).
15. Plugging in the values: P(E) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
16. Finally, we can calculate P(A|E): P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
