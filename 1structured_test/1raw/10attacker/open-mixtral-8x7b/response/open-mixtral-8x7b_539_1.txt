Let's reason through this:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the height (taller or shorter than 185 cm) 80% of the time, and the other witness does so 70% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but the victim couldn't see the attacker's height.
4. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, and only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, it seems more likely that the attacker's height was not 185 cm or taller.

However, without more information about how reliable the witnesses are when they make mistakes (i.e., whether they tend to overestimate or underestimate heights), it's difficult to provide an exact probability. 

But based on the given information, it seems reasonable to estimate that the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is less than 50%, given that the first witness's claim contradicts the known population statistics.

Here's a rough estimate:
{probability: 0.3, explanation: The first witness is correct 80% of the time, but since only 15% of the population meets this description, and we have no reason to believe the witness's error is biased towards taller heights, a generous estimate might be around 0.3.}
