Let's break down the information given:

1. The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, with a correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, with a correct identification rate of 70%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
