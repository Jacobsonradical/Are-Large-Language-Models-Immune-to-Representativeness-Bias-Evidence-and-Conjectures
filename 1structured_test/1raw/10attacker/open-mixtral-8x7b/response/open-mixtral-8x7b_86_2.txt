Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the height of 15% of the population.
3. However, the first witness is only correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
4. So, even though the attorney's argument might seem compelling, we need to account for the witness's error rate.

Let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) = P(Witness claims correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%. This is the probability that the witness is correct, given that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
