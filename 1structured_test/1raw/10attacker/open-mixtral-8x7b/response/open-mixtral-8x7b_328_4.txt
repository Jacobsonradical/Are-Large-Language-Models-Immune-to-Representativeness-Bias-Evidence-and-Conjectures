Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and has an 80% accuracy rate.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and has a 70% accuracy rate.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We're looking for P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim.

We know P(A), which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B|A), we need the accuracy of witness 1 when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

Now, we need to find P(B). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

Using the same logic as above, P(B and A) is the probability of witness 1 being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

P(B and not A) is the probability of witness 1 being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
