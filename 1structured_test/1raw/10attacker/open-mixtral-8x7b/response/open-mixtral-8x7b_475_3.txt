Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a situation where we can apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities.
3. Here, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".
4. We need to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
5. From the information given, we know that P(B|A) is the accuracy of the first witness when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
6. We also know that P(A) is the proportion of the population who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.
7. To find P(B), we need to consider all possible scenarios that could lead to the first witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This could happen either when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (event A), or when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identifies them as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this second scenario is 20% (the error rate of the first witness) multiplied by the proportion of the population who are shorter than 185 cm (85%), which is 17%.
8. Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 80% * 15% + 17% = 20.5%.
9. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|B) = 80% * 15% / 20.5% = 0.5854 (rounded to five decimal places).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.5854, or 58.54%.
