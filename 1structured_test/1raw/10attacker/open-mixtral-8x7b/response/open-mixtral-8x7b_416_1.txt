Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, while Witness 2 claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
3. The city's population statistics tell us that 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
4. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when estimating someone as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
5. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when estimating someone as shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the reliability of both witnesses. Since their testimonies contradict each other, we can calculate the probability that they are both incorrect (and thus the attacker's height is actually different from their claims) and then subtract that value from 1.

First, let's compute the probability that Witness 1 is incorrect when claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(W1 incorrect) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Next, let's compute the probability that Witness 2 is incorrect when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(W2 incorrect) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30

Now, let's consider the case where both witnesses are incorrect simultaneously. Since Witness 2 would be mistakenly claiming that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability that Witness 2 makes this specific error:

P(W2 claims attacker is shorter | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.30

Now, we can find the probability of both witnesses being incorrect:

P(W1 and W2 incorrect) = P(W1 incorrect) * P(W2 claims attacker is shorter | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1 and W2 incorrect) = 0.20 * 0.30 = 0.06

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, by subtracting the probability of both witnesses being incorrect from 1:

{probability: 0.94, reasoning: "1 - P(W1 and W2 incorrect) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94"}
