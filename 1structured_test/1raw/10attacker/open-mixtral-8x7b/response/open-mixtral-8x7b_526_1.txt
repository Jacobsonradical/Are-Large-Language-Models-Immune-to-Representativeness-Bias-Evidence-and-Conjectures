Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:
P(A) = 0.8 (probability of first witness correctly identifying a person as 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:
P(B) = 0.7 (probability of second witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185cm)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, the probability of a random person being 185cm or taller is:
P(C) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Since both events A and B are dependent on C, we can calculate the probability of both events occurring using the formula:
P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

We need to find P(B|A), the probability of the second witness being correct given that the first witness has claimed the attacker to be 185cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
P(B|A) = P(B ∩ C) / P(C)
= 0.3 (probability of both witnesses being correct when the person is actually 185cm or taller)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185cm or taller given that the first witness has claimed so:
P(C|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) / P(C)
= 0.3 * 0.8 / 0.15
= 1.6

However, this value is greater than 1, which is not possible for a probability. This indicates that there is an inconsistency in the given data or the assumptions made. Therefore, we cannot provide a valid estimate for the probability of the attacker's height being 185cm or taller based on the provided information.
