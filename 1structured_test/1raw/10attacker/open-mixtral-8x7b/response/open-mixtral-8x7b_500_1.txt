Let's reason through this:

1. We know that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
2. We know that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
3. From this, we can infer that if both witnesses are correct, then the attacker must be 185 cm or taller.
4. The probability of both witnesses being correct can be calculated as follows:
   - Probability of Witness 1 being correct: 0.8
   - Probability of Witness 2 being correct: 0.7
   - Since these are independent events, the probability of both being correct is the product of their individual probabilities: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

5. However, we also need to consider the possibility that Witness 2 is incorrect, in which case the opposite of their claim would mean the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The probability of Witness 2 being incorrect is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

6. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller as 15%. This is the prior probability.

7. To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. The formula for this is:

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

8. In our case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that both witnesses agree (or disagree) in their claims.

9. We have already calculated P(B|A) as 0.56 (the probability of both witnesses being correct) and P(A) as 0.15 (the prior probability).

10. To calculate P(B), we need to consider all possibilities:
    - Both witnesses are correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15
    - Both witnesses are incorrect and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85
    - Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect: 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15
    - Witness 1 is incorrect and Witness 2 is correct: 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85

11. Summing these probabilities gives us P(B): 0.0756 + 0.042 + 0.0252 + 0.0126 = 0.1554

12. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

    P(A|B) = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.1554 = 0.5462 / 0.1554 = 3.515

13. Since this result is greater than 1, it suggests that our initial assumption about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is more likely than not. However, we need to convert this into a probability between 0 and 1.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.77, explanation: "This is the posterior probability calculated using Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the prior probability, the probabilities of the witnesses being correct, and the distribution of heights in the population."}
