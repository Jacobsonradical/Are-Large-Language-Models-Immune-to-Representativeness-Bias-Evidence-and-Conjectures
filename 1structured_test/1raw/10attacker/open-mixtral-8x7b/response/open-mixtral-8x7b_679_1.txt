To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We calculate the probability based on the first witness's claim and the probability of the first witness being correct.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(witness 1 correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, let's consider the probability based on the second witness's claim and the probability of the second witness being correct.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's claim) = P(witness 2 correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Given that the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(witness 2 correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(witness 2 incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(witness 2 incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness 2 correct | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(witness 2 incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255
P(witness 2 correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.255 = 0.745

So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's claim) = 0.745 * 0.15 = 0.11175

Finally, to estimate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as both witnesses claimed, we combine the probabilities:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) * P(witness 1's claim) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's claim) * P(witness 2's claim)

Assuming both witnesses have an equal chance of being believed, P(witness 1's claim) = P(witness 2's claim) = 0.5

Hence,

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.12 * 0.5) + (0.11175 * 0.5) = 0.115875

Therefore, {probability: 0.1159} (rounded to three decimal places).
