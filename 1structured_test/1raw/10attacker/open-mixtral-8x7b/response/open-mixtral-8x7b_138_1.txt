To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height, as well as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height but the second witness's incorrect claim still suggests the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

1. P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to part b.
2. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly claims the height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80%, as stated in part a.
3. P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is 20%, as stated in part a.
4. P(not B|not A) is the probability that the first witness correctly claims the height is not 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This is 70%, as stated in part a.

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

Using the probabilities above:

P(A|B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / [(0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4211

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.4211}.
