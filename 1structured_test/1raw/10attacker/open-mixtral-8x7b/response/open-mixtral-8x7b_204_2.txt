Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs in 20% of the cases. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs in 30% of the cases.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attacker was described as taller than 185 cm by the first witness, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness is correct. 

To do this, we can use the concept of Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(T) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and P(E) as the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(T|E), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' theorem states that P(T|E) = [P(E|T) * P(T)] / P(E)

We know P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

To calculate P(E|T), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we use the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.

To calculate P(E|not T), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is not indeed 185 cm or taller, we use the complement of the witness's accuracy, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, we need to calculate P(E), the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given by the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the probabilities of the witness being incorrect.

P(E) = P(E and T) + P(E and not T)
P(E) = P(E|T) * P(T) + P(E|not T) * P(not T)
P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(T|E):

P(T|E) = [P(E|T) * P(T)] / P(E)
P(T|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(T|E) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(T|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
