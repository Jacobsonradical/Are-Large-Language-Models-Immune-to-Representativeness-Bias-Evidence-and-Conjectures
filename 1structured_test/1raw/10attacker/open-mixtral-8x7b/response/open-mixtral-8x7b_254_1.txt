Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately:
   - Witness 1: 80% chance of being correct, 20% chance of error
   - Witness 2: 70% chance of being correct, 30% chance of error

b. We also know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.

Since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we cannot directly use the witnesses' accuracy rates to determine the probability. Instead, we need to combine the witnesses' information with the population statistics.

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so to calculate the probability, we need to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct AND the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Using the information from the problem:
P(Witness 1 is correct) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from population statistics in part b)

So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

{probability: 0.12}
