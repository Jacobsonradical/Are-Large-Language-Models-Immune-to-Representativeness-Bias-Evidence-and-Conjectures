Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we will consider the first witness's claim.

Given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that the first witness is correct. To do this, we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

To calculate P(A ∩ B), we have two possibilities:
1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness correctly identifies this (80% probability).
2. The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the first witness erroneously claims they are 185 cm or taller (20% probability).

We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Instead, we can calculate P(B|A) and P(B|A'), where A' is the complement of A (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8
P(B|A') = 20% = 0.2

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

We know P(A) = 0.15, and since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(A') = 0.85.

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
