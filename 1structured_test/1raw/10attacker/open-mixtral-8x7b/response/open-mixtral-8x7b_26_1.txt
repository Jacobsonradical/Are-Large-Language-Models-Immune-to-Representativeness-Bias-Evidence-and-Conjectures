Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. This is a conditional probability and can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that both witnesses give conflicting testimonies.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(B|A): Given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witnesses give conflicting testimonies. This is the same as the first witness being incorrect, which happens 20% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.20
- P(B|A'): Given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witnesses give conflicting testimonies. This is the same as the first witness being correct (80% chance) and the second witness being incorrect (30% chance). So, P(B|A') = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Substituting the values we get:

P(B) = (0.20 * 0.15) + (0.24 * 0.85) = 0.03 + 0.204 = 0.234

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.20 * 0.15) / 0.234 â‰ˆ 0.132

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.132.
