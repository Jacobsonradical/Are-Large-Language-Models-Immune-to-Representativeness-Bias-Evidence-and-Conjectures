Let's consider the two witnesses' testimonies independently.

For the first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, the probability that they correctly identified the attacker' as being 185 cm or taller is 0.8, while the probability that they erred and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2.

For the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, the probability that they identified the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm is 0.7, while the probability that they erred and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.3.

Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities to find the overall probability of both events occurring.

Probability of both witnesses being correct: (0.8)*(1-0.3) = 0.8*0.7 = 0.56
Probability of both witnesses erring: (0.2)*(1-0.7) = 0.2*0.3 = 0.06

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities:

{probability: 0.56 + 0.06 = 0.62}
