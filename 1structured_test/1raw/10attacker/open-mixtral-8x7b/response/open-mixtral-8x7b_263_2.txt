Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (0.8). Similarly, the likelihood of the first witness being incorrect when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller is 20% (0.2). 

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the second witness being correct when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% (0.7). The likelihood of the second witness being incorrect when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm is 30% (0.3).

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as follows:

P(shorter) = 0.85 (population probability) * 0.7 (witness accuracy) + 0.15 (population probability) * 0.3 (witness error) = 0.665 + 0.045 = 0.71

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, would be:

P(185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(shorter) = 1 - 0.71 = 0.29

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.29}
