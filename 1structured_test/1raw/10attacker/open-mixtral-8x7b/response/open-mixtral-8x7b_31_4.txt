Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on Witness 1's claim.

Since both witnesses' claims cannot be true at the same time, we'll first consider the case where only Witness 1's claim is true, which means the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Population 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, is 12%.
