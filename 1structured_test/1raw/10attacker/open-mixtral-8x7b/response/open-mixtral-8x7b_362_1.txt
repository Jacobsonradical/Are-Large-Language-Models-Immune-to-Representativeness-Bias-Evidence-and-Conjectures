Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements are conflicting, we cannot use the information from both to increase our estimate of the attacker's height.
3. Instead, let's consider the accuracy of each witness.
4. The first witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
5. The population statistics tell us that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.
6. Now, we can calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
7. This is equal to the first witness's accuracy rate (0.8) multiplied by the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller (0.15): 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
