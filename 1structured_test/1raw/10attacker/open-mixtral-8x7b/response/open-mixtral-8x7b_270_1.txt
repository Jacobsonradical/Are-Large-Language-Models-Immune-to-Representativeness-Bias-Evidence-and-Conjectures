To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will calculate the probability based on each witness's statement and then combine them using the law of total probability.

First, let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the first witness's statement is true"
- C as the event "the second witness's statement is true"

We are interested in finding P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Now, we calculate the probabilities based on each witness's statement:

P(A|B) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller | the first witness is correct) = 1 (since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
P(A'|B) = P(the attacker is shorter than 185 cm | the first witness is correct) = 0 (since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller)

P(B) = P(the first witness is correct) = 0.8 (given in the question)

For the second witness:
P(A|C) = P(the attacker is 185 cm or taller | the second witness is correct) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A'|C) = P(the attacker is shorter than 185 cm | the second witness is correct) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(C) = P(the second witness is correct) = 0.7 (given in the question)

Now, we can calculate P(A) using the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|C) * P(C)
P(A) = (1 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.7)
P(A) = 0.8 + 0.105
P(A) â‰ˆ 0.905
