Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness:

Witness 1: Since the first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to this witness, is 0.8 (when the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

Witness 2: Similarly, the second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, so the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to this witness, is 0.7 (when the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

Now, we need to calculate the combined probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' testimonies. We can do this using Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of an event A (in our case, the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) given evidence B (the witnesses' testimonies) is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, P(B|A) is the combined probability of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and P(B) is the combined probability of the witnesses' testimonies for all possible attacker heights.

Let's calculate the terms in Bayes' theorem:

P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that 15% of the population meets this condition. So P(A) = 0.15

P(B|A): Combined probability of the witnesses' testimonies, given the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. Since both witnesses must agree, we need to calculate the probability of both testimonies being correct. This is the product of their individual correct probabilities:

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(B2|A) = 0.7 (Witness 2 correctly identifies height 70% of the time)
P(B|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

P(B): Combined probability of the witnesses' testimonies for all possible attacker heights. This requires calculating the probability of both witnesses agreeing when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's first calculate the probability of the witnesses agreeing when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The first witness is correct 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The combined probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:

P(B1',B2'|A') = P(B1'|A') * P(B2'|A') = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, let's calculate the probability of the witnesses agreeing when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The combined probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(B1,B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can now calculate P(B), the combined probability of the witnesses' testimonies for all possible attacker heights:

P(B) = P(A') * P(B1',B2'|A') + P(A) * P(B1,B2|A)
P(B) = (0.85) * (0.06) + (0.15) * (0.56) = 0.051 + 0.084 = 0.135

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, which is P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.135 â‰ˆ 0.634

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.634.
