Let's reason through this:

We know that one witness, who is correct 80% of the time, said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the other witness, who is correct 70% of the time, said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. 

Given that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance that this witness is mistaken. So, in 20% of the cases where the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the attacker is actually shorter.

However, we don't have enough information about the second witness's statement to make a direct estimation. We need to know the probability of the second witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Without this information, we can't provide a precise estimate. But if we assume that the witnesses' errors are independent, we can make a rough estimate. In this case, the probability that both witnesses are mistaken is the product of their individual error rates, which is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%.

So, even with this rough estimate, it seems more likely than not that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. But to provide a more accurate estimate, we would need more information.

Here's the answer in the requested format: {probability: cannot be determined accurately with the given information}.
