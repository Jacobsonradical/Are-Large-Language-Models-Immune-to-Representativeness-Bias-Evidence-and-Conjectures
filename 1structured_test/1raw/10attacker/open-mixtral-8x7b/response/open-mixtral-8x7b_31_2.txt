Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probability of each statement being correct and then multiply them together.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which they get right 80% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which they get right 70% of the time.
5. The probability that they both made correct statements is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
6. However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
7. Since the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there are two possibilities: the first witness is correct, or both witnesses are incorrect (but the first witness still claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
8. The probability that both witnesses are incorrect is 0.2 (first witness is wrong) * 0.3 (second witness is wrong) = 0.06.
9. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is the probability that they both made correct statements divided by the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.56 / (0.56 + 0.06) â‰ˆ 0.903.

{probability: 0.903}
