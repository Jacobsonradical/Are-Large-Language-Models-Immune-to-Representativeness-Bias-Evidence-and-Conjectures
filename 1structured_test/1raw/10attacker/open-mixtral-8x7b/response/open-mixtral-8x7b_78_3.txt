Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we need to find the probability of both the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller and Witness 1 being correct.

First, let's find the probability of Witness 1 being correct (given an attacker of 185 cm or taller):
P(W1 correct | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8

Next, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15

Finally, we can multiply these probabilities to find the probability of both events happening:
P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm and W1 correct) = P(W1 correct | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) * P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.12}.
