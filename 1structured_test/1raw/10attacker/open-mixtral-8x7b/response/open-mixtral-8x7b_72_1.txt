Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can analyze them separately and then combine their probabilities.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time according to the information provided.
4. So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, would be 0.8 (or 80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
