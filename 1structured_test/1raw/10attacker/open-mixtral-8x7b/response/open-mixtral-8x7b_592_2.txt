Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed so. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller".

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. From the problem statement, we have:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: either witness 1 is correct or witness 2 is correct. We can calculate these probabilities as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
