Let's break down the given information:

a) We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when identifying if a person is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time when identifying if a person is 185 cm or taller.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's find the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's statement:

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which means there are three possibilities:
1. Witness 1 is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
3. Witness 1 is incorrect, and the attacker's height is unknown to us (since the victim couldn't see the attacker's height).

We want to find the probability of the first possibility. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, treating Witness 1's claim as evidence.

First, we need the likelihood of Witness 1 making the claim given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller:
- This is simply the probability that Witness 1 is correct, which is 0.8 (80%).

Next, we need the likelihood of Witness 1 making the claim given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- This is the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly claims a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%).

Finally, we need the prior probabilities for the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability for the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (85%).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = (Likelihood of Witness 1's claim if Attacker is 185 cm or taller * Prior probability of Attacker being 185 cm or taller) / Total probability

Total probability = (Likelihood of Witness 1's claim if Attacker is 185 cm or taller * Prior probability of Attacker being 185 cm or taller) + (Likelihood of Witness 1's claim if Attacker is shorter than 185 cm * Prior probability of Attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:

Total probability = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
