Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 made this claim.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

{probability: 0.36}
