Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. The first witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time (and errs 20%).
4. According to the city's statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
5. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct in this case is 0.8 (the probability of them being correct if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
