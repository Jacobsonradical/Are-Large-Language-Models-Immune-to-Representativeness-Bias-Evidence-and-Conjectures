Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement. Note that we'll multiply the probabilities of the two witnesses' statements to get the overall probability.

For Witness 1:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 ≈ 0.12

For Witness 2:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) = P(Witness 2 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness 2 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.7 * 0.15 ≈ 0.105

Now we multiply the probabilities from both witnesses:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2)
≈ 0.12 * 0.105 ≈ 0.0126

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.0126}
