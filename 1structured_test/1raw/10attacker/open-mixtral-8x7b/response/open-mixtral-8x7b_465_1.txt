To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. 

First, let's denote:
A - the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
W1 - the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller
W2 - the event that the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We are interested in finding P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so.

From the information provided, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(A'|W1) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
P(A|W2) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identified the height 30% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can use the law of total probability to calculate P(W1), the probability that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(W1) = P(W1 ∩ A) + P(W1 ∩ A') = P(A) * P(W1|A) + P(A') * P(W1|A')

We know P(A) and since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, we have P(W1|A) = 0.8. Similarly, since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(W1|A') = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the above equation:

P(W1) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1 ∩ A) / P(W1) = P(A) * P(W1|A) / P(W1) = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
