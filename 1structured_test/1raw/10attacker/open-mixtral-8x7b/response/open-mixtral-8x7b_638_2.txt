Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185cm, their statement contradicts the first witness'. We will consider these two statements as independent events.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W1|T) = 0.8, where W1 is the event of the first witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller, and T is the event of the attacker actually being 185cm or taller.
4. The first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(W1|~T) = 0.2, where ~T is the event of the attacker not being 185cm or taller (i.e., being shorter than 185cm).
5. The probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is computed using Bayes' theorem:
   P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / [P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|~T) * P(~T)]
6. We are given that 15% of the population is 185cm or taller, so P(T) = 0.15, and P(~T) = 0.85.
7. Plugging in the values, we get:
   P(T|W1) = [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.5556

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5556}
