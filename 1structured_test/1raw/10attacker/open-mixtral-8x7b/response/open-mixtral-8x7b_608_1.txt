Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(Correct|185cm+) = 0.8 (the witness's ability to judge a person's height)

Next, we calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:

P(Correct|<185cm) = 0.2

Now, let's use the second piece of information to find the base rates in the population:

P(185cm+) = 0.15
P(<185cm) = 0.85

We can now calculate the combined probability of the first witness being correct given the two possible attacker heights:

P(Correct) = P(185cm+) * P(Correct|185cm+) + P(<185cm) * P(Correct|<185cm)
= (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so:

P(185cm+|Claimed 185cm+) = P(Correct|185cm+) * P(185cm+) / P(Correct)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
