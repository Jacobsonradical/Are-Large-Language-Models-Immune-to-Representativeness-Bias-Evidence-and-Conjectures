Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate when guessing a person's height.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate when guessing a person's height.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the weighted average of the two witnesses' success rates for their respective claims:

Weighted Average Success Rate = (Success Rate of Witness 1 * Probability of Witness 1 being correct) + (Success Rate of Witness 2 * Probability of Witness 2 being correct)

We don't know the actual heights of the attacker or the attacker's probability distribution. However, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can assume that the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 15%.

Now, we can calculate the weighted average success rate:

Weighted Average Success Rate = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0.7 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75

Since the weighted average success rate is 0.75, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.75 * 0.15, rounded to two decimal places}

The final answer is: {probability: 0.11, rounded to two decimal places}
