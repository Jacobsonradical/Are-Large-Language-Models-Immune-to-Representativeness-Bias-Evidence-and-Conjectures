Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the first witness will correctly identify this 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.

However, since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we know that the first witness must have made an error in this case. Given that the second witness was correct 70% of the time, the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.3.

Therefore, the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height, is:

P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We don't know the actual probability of the attacker's height, but we can use the population statistics as a prior. Therefore, assuming the attacker is representative of the city's population, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Putting it all together, we get:

P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.35}
