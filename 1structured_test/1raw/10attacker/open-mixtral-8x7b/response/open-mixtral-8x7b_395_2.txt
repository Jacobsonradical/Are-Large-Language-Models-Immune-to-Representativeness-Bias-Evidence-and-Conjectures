Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.
2. According to the information provided, the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, which means that the first witness is more likely to be incorrect.
4. To find the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   Where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
5. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (probability of the first witness being correct), P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city), and we need to find P(A|B):
   P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
   = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
   = 0.12 + 0.17
   = 0.29
6. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
   = 0.12 / 0.29
   = 0.4137931

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 (41%).
