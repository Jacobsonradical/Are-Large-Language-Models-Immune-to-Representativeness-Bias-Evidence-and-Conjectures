Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A represents "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B represents "Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both possibilities:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

1. P(B and A) is the probability of Witness 1 being correct when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:
P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

2. P(B and not A) is the probability of Witness 1 making an error when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:
P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
