Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification 80% of the time.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time, but we know this is not the case here.
4. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is 0.8 (or 80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
