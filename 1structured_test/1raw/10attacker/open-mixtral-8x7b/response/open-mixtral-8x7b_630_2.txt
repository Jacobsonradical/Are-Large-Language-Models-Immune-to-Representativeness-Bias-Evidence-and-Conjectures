Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = P(first witness is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(first witness is correct) = 0.8 (80% chance that the first witness is correct)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population based on the information given)

So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%

The answer is: {probability: 0.12}
