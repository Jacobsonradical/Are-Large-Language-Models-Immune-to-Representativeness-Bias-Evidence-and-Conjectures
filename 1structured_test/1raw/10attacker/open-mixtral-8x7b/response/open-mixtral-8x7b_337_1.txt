Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement:

Witness 1: 80% (correct identification rate) * 15% (population taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.12 or 12%
Witness 2: 70% (correct identification rate) * 15% (population taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.105 or 10.5%

Since both witnesses' statements need to be satisfied, we can use the conjunction rule to combine their probabilities:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

We want to find P(attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements), or P(A and B), where A is the event that the first witness is correct and B is the event that the second witness is correct.

P(A) = 12%
P(B|A) = probability that the second witness is correct given that the first witness is correct

To calculate P(B|A), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B|A) = P(B and A) / P(A)

We are given the individual probabilities of each witness being correct, so:

P(B and A) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Witness 2 is correct | Witness 1 is correct)
= 0.80 (first witness's correct identification rate) * 0.70 (second witness's correct identification rate)
= 0.56 or 56%

Now we can find P(B|A):
P(B|A) = 56% / 12% = 4.67

However, this value is greater than 1, which is not possible. This means that the two witnesses' statements contradict each other, so we cannot provide a coherent estimate of the probability. The information provided is inconsistent.
