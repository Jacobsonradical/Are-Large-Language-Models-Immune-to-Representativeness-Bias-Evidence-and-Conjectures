Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185) = 0.8 (probability of first witness correctly identifying someone 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:

P(A<185) = 0.7 (probability of second witness correctly identifying someone shorter than 185cm)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, we can calculate the probability of the second witness's claim being correct:

P(S<185) = 0.85 (probability of a randomly chosen person being shorter than 185cm)
P(S>=185) = 0.15 (probability of a randomly chosen person being 185cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A>=185 | W1=A>=185) = P(W1=A>=185 | A>=185) * P(A>=185) / P(W1=A>=185)

We have P(W1=A>=185 | A>=185) = 0.8, P(A>=185) = 0.15, and we need to calculate P(W1=A>=185):

P(W1=A>=185) = P(W1=A>=185 | A>=185) * P(A>=185) + P(W1=A>=185 | A<185) * P(A<185)
= 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

So, P(A>=185 | W1=A>=185) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.35 = 0.24 / 0.35 = 0.6857 or 68.57%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.6857, or 68.57%}.
