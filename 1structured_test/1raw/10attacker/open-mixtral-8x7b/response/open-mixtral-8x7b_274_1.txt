Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. So, the likelihood of the first witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
3. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since the second witness is only correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 30% chance that they're wrong, which would mean they're actually seeing someone 185 cm or taller.
4. Given that the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, and assuming the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the second witness would make this error is 0.3 (the 30% chance of being wrong).
5. Therefore, the probability of both witnesses making these errors is the product of their individual probabilities of error, which is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06.
6. We want the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as: P(185 cm | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(W1, W2)
7. However, since the two witnesses' testimonies contradict each other, we know that P(W1, W2) (the probability of both testimonies being true) is 0 because the testimonies cannot both be correct.
8. Therefore, we can't use Bayes' theorem directly, but we can look at the two possible scenarios (attacker is 185 cm or taller, or attacker is shorter than 185 cm) and calculate the probabilities for each scenario given the witnesses' testimonies.
9. If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability of both witnesses' testimonies is 0.8 (first witness correct) * 0.3 (second witness incorrect) = 0.24.
10. If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of both witnesses' testimonies is 0.15 (first witness incorrect) * 0.7 (second witness correct) = 0.105.
11. Since the total probability of both scenarios must add up to 1, we can calculate the missing probability for the scenario "attacker is 185 cm or taller" as 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.105) = 0.696 or 69.6%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.696}
