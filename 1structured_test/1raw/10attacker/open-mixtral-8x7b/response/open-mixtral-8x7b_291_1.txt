Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when guessing a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
4. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability:

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. For the first witness's claim to be true, either both witnesses have to be correct, or only the first witness has to be correct.

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.8 + 0.7 - 0.56 = 0.94

However, we also need to consider the scenario where only the first witness is correct:

P(A and not B) = P(A) * (1 - P(B)) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, the final estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.94 + 0.24 = 1.18, but since a probability should be between 0 and 1, we need to reconsider our approach.}

The problem lies in the fact that the two events (the first witness being correct and the second witness being correct) are not mutually exclusive, so we cannot simply add their probabilities. Instead, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness is correct, given that one of them is correct:

P(A | A or B) = P(A and B) / P(A or B) = 0.56 / 0.94 â‰ˆ 0.5957

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5957}
