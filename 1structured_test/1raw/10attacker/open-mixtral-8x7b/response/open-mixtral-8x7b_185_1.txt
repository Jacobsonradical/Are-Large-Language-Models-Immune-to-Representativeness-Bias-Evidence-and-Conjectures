Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's testimony, and then combine these probabilities using Bayes' theorem.

For the first witness, since they claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their error rate is 20%, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H1) given the first witness's testimony (W1) is:

P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) * P(H1) / P(W1)

We are given that P(W1|H1) = 0.8 (the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the height when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller) and P(H1) = 0.15 (the prior probability of the person being 185 cm or taller in the population).

Now, to calculate P(W1), we need to consider both cases: the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H1) and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (H2). The probability of the first witness's testimony when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(W1|H2) = 0.2 (the probability of the witness making an error when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H1) * P(H1) + P(W1|H2) * P(H2)
P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H1|W1):

P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) * P(H1) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

Now let's repeat the process for the second witness.

The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their error rate is 30%. The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (H2) given the second witness's testimony (W2) is:

P(H2|W2) = P(W2|H2) * P(H2) / P(W2)

We are given that P(W2|H2) = 0.7 (the probability of the second witness correctly identifying the height when the person is indeed shorter than 185 cm) and P(H2) = 0.85 (the prior probability of the person being shorter than 185 cm in the population).

Now, to calculate P(W2), we need to consider both cases: the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H1) and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (H2). The probability of the second witness's testimony when the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(W2|H1) = 0.3 (the probability of the witness making an error when the person is 185 cm or taller).

Now we can find P(W2):

P(W2) = P(W2|H1) * P(H1) + P(W2|H2) * P(H2)
P(W2) = (0.3 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64

Now we can calculate P(H2|W2):

P(H2|W2) = P(W2|H2) * P(H2) / P(W2) = 0.7 * 0.85 / 0.64 ≈ 0.8906

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the probabilities from both witnesses:

P(H1|W1 ∩ W2) = P(H1|W1) * P(H2|W2) / (P(H1|W1) * P(H2|W2) + P(H2|W1) * P(H1|W2))

We already calculated P(H1|W1) ≈ 0.345 and P(H2|W2) ≈ 0.8906. To calculate P(H2|W1), we need to find the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness has a 30% error rate, this probability is P(H2|W1) = 0.3. Similarly, P(H1|W2) = 0.2 (the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) since the first witness has a 20% error rate.

Now we can calculate P(H1|W1 ∩ W2):

P(H1|W1 ∩ W2) = 0.345 * 0.8906 / (0.345 * 0.8906 + 0.3 * 0.2) ≈ 0.2987

Now, since we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed, we need to calculate P(H1|W1) + P(H1 ∩ W2) / 2:

(0.345 + 0.2987) / 2 ≈ 0.3219

{probability: 0.3219}
