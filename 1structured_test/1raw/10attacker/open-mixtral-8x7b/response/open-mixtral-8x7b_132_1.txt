Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in determining height. So, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is 0.8 (or 80%).
3. However, the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since the second witness is wrong 30% of the time, there's still a chance that they're incorrect and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
4. To calculate this, we take the probability that the second witness is wrong (0.3 or 30%) and multiply it by the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15 or 15%). This gives us 0.045 or 4.5%.
5. Now, we need to account for the fact that both witnesses can't be right and can't be wrong at the same time. We calculate the probability that both witnesses are wrong (0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%) and add this to our previous calculation (4.5% + 6% = 10.5%).
6. To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, we subtract the probability that both witnesses are wrong (10.5%) from the initial probability based on the first witness's statement (80%). This gives us 0.795 or 79.5%.

So, {probability: 0.795, or 79.5%}
