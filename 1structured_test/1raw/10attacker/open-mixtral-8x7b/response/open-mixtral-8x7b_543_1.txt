Let's first calculate the likelihoods of the first witness being correct and incorrect:

P(W1_correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1_incorrect) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Similarly, let's calculate the likelihoods for the second witness:

P(W2_correct) = 0.7 (the witness correctly identifies someone who is not 185 cm or taller 70% of the time)
P(W2_incorrect) = 0.3 (the witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the second witness:

P(Tall | W2_correct) = 0.15 (15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller)
P(Tall | W2_incorrect) = 0.85 (85% chance that a person is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to both witnesses:

P(Tall) = P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_correct) + P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_incorrect) + P(Tall and W1_incorrect and W2_correct)

First, let's find the intersection probabilities:

P(W1_correct and W2_correct) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_correct) = (0.8) * (0.7) = 0.56
P(W1_correct and W2_incorrect) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_incorrect) = (0.8) * (0.3) = 0.24
P(W1_incorrect and W2_correct) = P(W1_incorrect) * P(W2_correct) = (0.2) * (0.7) = 0.14

Now, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the intersection probabilities:

P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_correct) = P(W1_correct and W2_correct) * P(Tall | W1_correct and W2_correct) ≈ 0.56 * 0.85 = 0.476
P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_incorrect) = P(W1_correct and W2_incorrect) * P(Tall | W1_correct and W2_incorrect) ≈ 0.24 * 0.15 = 0.036
P(Tall and W1_incorrect and W2_correct) = P(W1_incorrect and W2_correct) * P(Tall | W1_incorrect and W2_correct) ≈ 0.14 * 0.15 = 0.021

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall) = P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_correct) + P(Tall and W1_correct and W2_incorrect) + P(Tall and W1_incorrect and W2_correct) ≈ 0.476 + 0.036 + 0.021 ≈ 0.533

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.533 or 53.3%.
