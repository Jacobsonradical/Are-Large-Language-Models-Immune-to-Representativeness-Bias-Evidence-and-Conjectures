Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from both witnesses. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the information provided by both witnesses.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

We have the following probabilities:
- P(A) = 15% (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.3 (witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, so they are incorrect 30% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2885 or 28.85%

So, given the information provided, there's a 28.85% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

{probability: 0.2885}
