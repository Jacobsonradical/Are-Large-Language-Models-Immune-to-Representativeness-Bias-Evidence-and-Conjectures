Let's analyze the given information:

a) We have two witnesses with differing estimations of the attacker's height. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

b) The city's population statistics show that 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim:

1. The probability of Witness 1 being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability of Witness 2 being incorrect when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.3 (30%).
3. Since both conditions must be met, we multiply the probabilities: 0.8 (Witness 1 correct) x 0.3 (Witness 2 incorrect) = 0.24.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to Witness 1's claim, is 0.24.

{probability: 0.24}
