Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Since the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there are two possibilities:
   a. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness gave a correct statement.
   b. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness made an error.
3. We want to find the probability of option a).
4. To calculate this, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
5. P(B) is the sum of probabilities of two cases: either the attacker is 185 cm or taller (event A), or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness made an error (event ~A).
6. P(B) = P(A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A)
7. The problem states that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(A) = 0.15.
8. P(B|~A) is the probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is equal to the error rate of the second witness, which is 30%.
9. P(~A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
10. So, P(B) = 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.15 + 0.255 = 0.405.
11. Now, we can calculate P(A|B): P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
12. P(A ∩ B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct in this case, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) = 0.15.
13. So, P(A|B) = 0.15 / 0.405 ≈ 0.3698

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.3698.
