Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from both witnesses. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

We don't have enough information to directly calculate P(W1,W2|A) and P(W1,W2), so instead, let's find the probabilities for the other possibility:
P(A'|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A') * P(A') / P(W1,W2)

Where P(A') is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula:

P(A|W1,W2) = 1 - P(A'|W1,W2)

Let's calculate the terms required:

P(W1,W2|A') = P(W1|A') * P(W2|A') = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (20% error from W1 and 30% error from W2)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can find P(A'|W1,W2):

P(A'|W1,W2) = 0.06 * 0.85 / (0.06 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15) ≈ 0.074

Finally, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A|W1,W2) = 1 - P(A'|W1,W2) ≈ 1 - 0.074 ≈ 0.926

Format the answer:
{probability: 0.926}
