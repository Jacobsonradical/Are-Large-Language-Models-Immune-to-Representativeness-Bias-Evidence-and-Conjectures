Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Witness 2 is incorrect)

Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(Witness 1 is correct) = 0.8

Given that Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(Witness 2 is incorrect) = 0.3

Now, we multiply these probabilities:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
