Let's reason through this:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the height as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies someone as that tall 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 15% of the people are 185cm or taller, and 85% are shorter.
3. We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness said the attacker's height was 185cm or taller.

We want P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From Bayes' Theorem, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We're given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases: when the attacker's height is 185cm or taller (A), and when it's not (A'). 

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (P(B|A') * 0.85)

We don't know P(B|A'), the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller when they're not. But we can calculate it using the fact that the witness is wrong 20% of the time: P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.68 = 1.48

Finally, P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 1.48 = 0.0877...

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.0877 or 8.77%.
