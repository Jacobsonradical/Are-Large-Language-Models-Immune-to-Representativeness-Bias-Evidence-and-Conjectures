To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A) given the observations of the two witnesses (evidence E).

Bayes' theorem states: P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given:
1. P(E|A): The probability of the witnesses making the observations they made given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is the sensitivity of their judgments, i.e., the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time.
2. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% in the problem.
3. P(E): The total probability of making the observations, given both possibilities for the attacker's height.

Calculating P(E|A) involves multiplying the probabilities that each witness makes their respective observations, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. That is, P(E|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.

Calculating P(E|~A), the probability of making the observations given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm, involves multiplying the probabilities that each witness makes their respective observations when the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. That is, P(E|~A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Calculating P(E) involves summing the probabilities of making the observations for both possibilities for the attacker's height. That is, P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A), where P(~A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm (1 - 0.15 = 0.85) and P(E|~A) is calculated above.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(A|E) = 0.56 * 0.15 / (0.56 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85)

Performing the calculation, we get:
P(A|E) â‰ˆ 0.304

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.304, or 30.4%.
