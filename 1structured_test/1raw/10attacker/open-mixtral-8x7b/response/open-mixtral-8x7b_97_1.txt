Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

For the first witness, the probability of being correct is 0.8 (80%). For the second witness, the probability of being correct is 0.7 (70%). Since both events are independent, the probability of them happening at the same time is the product of their individual probabilities:

P(1st witness correct and 2nd witness correct) = P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Now, let's calculate the probability of the following scenario: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. However, we need to account for the fact that the first witness is more likely to be correct than an average person. Therefore, we will weigh the 15% by the first witness's accuracy:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | 1st witness claims so) = P(1st witness correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

This is our final answer.

{probability: 0.12}
