Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller, based on their 80% accuracy rate. This means that the probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of them being incorrect is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, let's calculate the probability of randomly selecting a person who is 185 cm or taller in the city, which is given as 15% in the information provided. So, the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Since the two witnesses' statements are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get the combined probability.

The probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(witness1 says 185cm or taller) * P(witness2 says 185cm or taller | witness1 says 185cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
≈ 0.497

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as they did. This is the probability that the first witness says so, regardless of what the second witness claims:

P(witness1 says 185cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) + 0.2 * 0.85 / (0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15)
≈ 0.667

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.667 (66.7%).
