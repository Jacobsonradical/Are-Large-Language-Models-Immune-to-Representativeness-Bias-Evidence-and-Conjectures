Let's first calculate the independent probability estimates of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on each witness's testimony:

Witness 1:
The witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate. So, the probability is 0.8.

Witness 2:
The witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate. So, the probability of this statement being true is 0.3 (100% - 70%), and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.

Now, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being incorrect, as this is the only scenario where the attacker could be 185 cm or taller based on witness 2's testimony:

P(Both_incorrect) = P(Witness_1_incorrect) * P(Witness_2_incorrect)

We know that:
P(Witness_1_incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
P(Witness_2_incorrect) = P(Attacker_taller) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)

So, P(Both_incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on both witnesses' testimonies:

P(Attacker_taller) = P(Witness_1_correct) * P(Both_incorrect)
P(Attacker_taller) = 0.8 * 0.03
P(Attacker_taller) = 0.024

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.024}
