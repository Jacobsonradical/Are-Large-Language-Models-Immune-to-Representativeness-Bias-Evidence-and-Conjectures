Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
b) The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.
c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Let's define the following events:
W1: The event that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W2: The event that the second witness correctly claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want P(H|W1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / P(W1)

P(W1|H) is the probability of the first witness correctly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

P(H) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%, according to point c).

To compute P(W1), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (H), and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (H').

P(W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|H') * P(H')

P(W1|H') is the probability of the first witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

P(H') is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%, according to point c).

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
