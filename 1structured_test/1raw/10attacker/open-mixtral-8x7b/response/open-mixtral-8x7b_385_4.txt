To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the first witness's claim (B). 

Let's denote P(A) as the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15. 

Let's denote P(B|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

Let's denote P(B'|A') as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, they must be incorrect 20% of the time, so this is also 0.2.

Let's denote P(B'|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

Let's denote P(B|A') as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness is correct 70% of the time, they must be incorrect 30% of the time, so this is also 0.3.

According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability we want to find is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A')]

First, we need to find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (with probability P(B|A) * P(A)), and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (with probability P(B'|A') * P(A')). So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A').

The probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(B'), is calculated similarly: P(B') = P(B|A') * P(A') + P(B'|A) * P(A).

The posterior probability we want to find is then:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Now, let's compute the numbers:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.32 or 32%.
