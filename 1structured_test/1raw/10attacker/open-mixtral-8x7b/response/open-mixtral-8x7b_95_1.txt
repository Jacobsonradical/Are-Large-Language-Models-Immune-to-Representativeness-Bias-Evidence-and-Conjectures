Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let W2 be the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(W2|A') = 0.7 (witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when A' is true, i.e., the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W1), which can be calculated as follows:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.7) * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.35
= 0.47

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.47
â‰ˆ 0.2553

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2553 or 25.53%.
