Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
2. The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
3. According to the statistics given, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given these facts, it seems reasonable to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as 15% (the base rate), but the witness's testimony should increase this probability. The witness's error rate is 20%, so the probability of them being correct is 80%. 

Therefore, we multiply the base rate (15%) by the witness's accuracy (80%) to get our estimate:

0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.12}.
