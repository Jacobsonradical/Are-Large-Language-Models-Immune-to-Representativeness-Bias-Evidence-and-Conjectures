Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness. We cannot use the second witness's statement to help us estimate the attacker's height.
3. So, we will rely on the first witness's ability to correctly identify the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller. They are correct 80% of the time.
4. Based on this information, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 or 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
