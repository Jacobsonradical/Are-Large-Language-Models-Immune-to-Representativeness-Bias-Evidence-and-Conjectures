Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker's actual height in 15% of the population plus the times Witness 1 erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (which is 20% of the time). So, Witness 1's claim is correct 15% + 0.20(100-15) = 15 + 16 = 31% of the time.

So, my estimate is:
{probability: 0.31, or 31%}
