To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B1 is the first witness's claim that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B2 is the second witness's claim that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, P(B1) is the probability that the first witness's claim is true, and P(B2) is the probability that the second witness's claim is true.

From the information given, we know that:
- P(B1) = 0.5 (since there is a 50/50 chance that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller based on population statistics)
- P(B2) = 0.5 (for the same reason as above)
- P(A|B1) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|B2) = 0.15 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, which means they are incorrectly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the the 15% of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 4.5%, or 0.15 as a percentage)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)
= 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.15 * 0.5
= 0.4 + 0.075
= 0.475

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.475, or 47.5%.
