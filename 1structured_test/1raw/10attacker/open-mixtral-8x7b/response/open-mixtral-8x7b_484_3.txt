Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person would be 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
3. Now let's consider the testimony of the first witness. The witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and errs 20% of the time.
4. The testimony of the second witness doesn't affect our calculation for the first witness's claim.
5. So, the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (prior probability) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.
6. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the first witness erred in their judgment. The first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
7. Given that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and that witness is correct 70% of the time, this means there's a 70% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
8. Therefore, the probability that the first witness erred in their claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.7 (second witness's accuracy) * 0.2 (first witness's error rate) = 0.14 or 14%.

Given our reasoning, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 12% (0.12). However, the more reliable second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is more likely to be correct with a probability of 84% (0.7 * 0.8 + 0.14), considering both the population statistics and the witnesses' accuracy.
