Given the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height, we can calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the probability that the second witness is correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

For the first witness, the probability of being correct is 0.8, as stated in the problem. For the second witness, the probability of being correct is 0.7. Therefore, the probability that both witnesses are correct is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.

However, it's also possible that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct. The probability that the first witness is incorrect is 0.2, and the probability that the second witness is correct is 0.7, so the probability that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct is 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Since these are the only two possibilities, we can add up these probabilities to get the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

Probability = P(first witness correct) + P(first witness incorrect and second witness correct)
= 0.56 + 0.14
= 0.7

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.7}.
