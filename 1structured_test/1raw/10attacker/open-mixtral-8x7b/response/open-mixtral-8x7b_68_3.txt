Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker's actual height in 15% of the population plus the cases where Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller. Given Witness 1's error rate of 20%, this adds another 17% (20% of 85) to our estimate.
3. So, the total percentage of times Witness 1 would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% + 17% = 32%.

Therefore, based on the available information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
