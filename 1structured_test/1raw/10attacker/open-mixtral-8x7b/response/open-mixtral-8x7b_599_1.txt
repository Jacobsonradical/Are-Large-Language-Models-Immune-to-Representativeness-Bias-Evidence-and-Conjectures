Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know the distribution of heights in the city's population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that both witnesses made a mistake or that only Witness 1 was correct.

First, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses made a mistake:
P(both_mistakes) = P(W1_mistake) * P(W2_mistake)

Given Witness 1's performance:
P(W1_mistake) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Given Witness 2's performance:
P(W2_mistake) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

So, P(both_mistakes) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, let's calculate the probability that only Witness 1 was correct:
P(W1_correct, W2_mistake) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_mistake)

Given Witness 1's performance:
P(W1_correct) = 0.8

Given Witness 2's performance:
P(W2_mistake) = 0.3

So, P(W1_correct, W2_mistake) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Finally, we need to account for the city's population distribution:
P(attacker_tall) = P(both_mistakes) + P(W1_correct, W2_mistake)

We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so:

P(attacker_tall) = 0.06 + 0.24 * 0.15 = 0.06 + 0.036 = 0.096

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.096}
