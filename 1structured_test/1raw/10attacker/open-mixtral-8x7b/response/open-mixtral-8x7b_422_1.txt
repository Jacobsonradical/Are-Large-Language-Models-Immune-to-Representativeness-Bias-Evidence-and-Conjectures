To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. Here's the reasoning:

1. Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.
3. We can find P(A|B) using the following formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
4. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness accuracy when the attacher's height is 185 cm or taller)
5. The base rate P(A) can be found using the given information about the population: P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
6. To find P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
7. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35
8. Now we can find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343
