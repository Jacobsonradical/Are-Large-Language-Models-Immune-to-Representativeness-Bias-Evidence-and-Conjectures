Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement.

For the first witness, the probability of being correct is 80%, and the probability of being incorrect is 20%. Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability of this being correct is 0.8, and the probability of this being incorrect is 0.2.

For the second witness, the probability of being correct is 70%, and the probability of being incorrect is 30%. Given that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this being correct is 0.7, and the probability of this being incorrect is 0.3.

Since both witnesses' statements cannot be correct at the same time, we need to consider the probability of the first witness being correct AND the second witness being incorrect.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the second witness being incorrect (i.e., the attacker is taller than 185 cm) is 15%.

Now, we want to find the probability of the first witness being correct AND the second witness being incorrect. This can be calculated as the probability of the first witness being correct multiplied by the probability of the second witness being incorrect:

P(185 cm or taller) = P(first witness correct) x P(second witness incorrect)
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.8 x 0.15
P(185 cm or taller) = 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
