Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time, and incorrectly claims someone is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
b) The second witness correctly identifies the correct height (shorter than 185 cm) 70% of the time, and incorrectly claims someone is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.
c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. We will calculate the probability based on the first witness's testimony and then adjust it based on the second witness's testimony and the population statistics.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."
- B as the event "The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."
- C as the event "The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm."

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Using Bayes' theorem, we first find P(B|A), the probability of B given A:

P(B|A) = 1 (The first witness always claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.)

Next, we find P(A), the probability of A:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.)

Then, we find P(B), the probability of B:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
          = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
          = 0.15 + 0.17
          = 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
           = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32
           â‰ˆ 0.46875

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.46875.
