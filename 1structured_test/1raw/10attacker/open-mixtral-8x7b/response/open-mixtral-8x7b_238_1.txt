Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, with a 80% accuracy rate, which means there's an 80% chance that Witness 1 is correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy rate, which means there's a 70% chance that Witness 2 is correct when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm.

Since both witnesses have made conflicting statements, we need to estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct given that Witness 2 is incorrect.

The probability that Witness 2 is incorrect when claiming a person is shorter than 185 cm is 30% (100% - 70%). Given that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and is incorrect 30% of the time, the attacker has a 30% chance of actually being 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

Now, we need to calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, while Witness 2 is incorrect when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. To do this, we need to multiply the prior probability (30%) by the accuracy rate of Witness 1 (80%).

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims so AND Witness 2 claims shorter) = 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24 or 24%.
