Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height. The first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time. The second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that both witnesses are correct.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that both witnesses are correct. We want to find P(A) given P(B).

Using the formula for conditional probability, we have:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness is correct) and P(B|A') = 0.70 (second witness is correct). We want to find P(A) given P(B). However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(B).

To proceed, we can make an assumption that the witnesses' errors are independent events. Although this might not be entirely accurate in real life, it simplifies the calculation and often provides a reasonable estimate.

Under this assumption, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A')
     = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
     = (0.80) * (P(A)) + (0.70) * (1 - P(A))

Now we can rewrite the conditional probability formula as:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / ((0.80) * (P(A)) + (0.70) * (1 - P(A)))

We know that P(A) is the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.80) * (0.15) / ((0.80) * (0.15) + (0.70) * (1 - 0.15))
      â‰ˆ 0.574

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 57.4%.
