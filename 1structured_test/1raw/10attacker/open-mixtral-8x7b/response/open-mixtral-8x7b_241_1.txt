Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the scenario where the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect, as this would support the first witness's claim.

The probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect is:

P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
