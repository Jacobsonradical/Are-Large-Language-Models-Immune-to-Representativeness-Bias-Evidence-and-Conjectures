Let's reason through this:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly claims a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution doesn't matter much here since we're only interested in the witness's accuracy.

Given this information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, would be the same as the witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
