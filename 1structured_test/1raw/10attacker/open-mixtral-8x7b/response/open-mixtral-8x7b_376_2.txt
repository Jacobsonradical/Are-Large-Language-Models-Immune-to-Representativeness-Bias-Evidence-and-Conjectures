Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

Witness 1:
P(Correct) = 0.8
P(Incorrect) = 0.2

Witness 2:
P(Correct) = 0.7
P(Incorrect) = 0.3

Given that Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. We can do this by calculating the joint probability of Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being incorrect, since if Witness 1 is correct, then Witness 2 must be incorrect.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 correct and Witness 2 incorrect)

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 15%. We can use this to calculate the required joint probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 incorrect | Witness 1 correct)
= (0.8) * (1 - P(Witness 2 correct | Witness 1 correct))
= (0.8) * (1 - (P(Witness 2 correct) / P(Witness 1 correct)))
= (0.8) * (1 - (0.7 / 0.8))
= 0.28 or 28%

So, given the available information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 28%.

{probability: 0.28}
