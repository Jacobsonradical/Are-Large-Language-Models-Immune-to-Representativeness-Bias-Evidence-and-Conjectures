Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. So, we will only consider the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
5. The population statistics state that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is the same as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

The answer is: {probability: 0.8}
