Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of this being correct by considering the accuracy of both witnesses.

If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, then witness 1 is correct with a probability of 0.8 (80%). However, if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, then witness 1 is correct with a probability of 0.2 (20%), but this contradicts the claim made by witness 1.

We can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

To calculate P(B|not A), we use witness 1's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.64 + 0.68 = 0.132

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.132 â‰ˆ 0.833
