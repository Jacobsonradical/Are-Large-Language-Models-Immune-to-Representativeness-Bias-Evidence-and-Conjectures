Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the city's population. So, P(A) = 0.15

Now, let's calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness makes the claim regardless of the attacker's true height. This occurs when the first witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and when the first witness is incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but the second witness is also incorrect, which happens 30% of the time when the second witness claims the person is shorter than 185 cm).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85 * 0.3)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.0402
P(B) = 0.1602

Now, let's calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.1602
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.7485

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.7485 or 74.85%.
