Let's break down the problem and calculate the probabilities:

1. The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
2. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with a probability of 0.7 (70%).
3. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we are interested in the probability that the first witness is correct AND the second witness is incorrect.
4. The second witness is incorrect with a probability of 0.3 (30%).
5. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (24%).

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
