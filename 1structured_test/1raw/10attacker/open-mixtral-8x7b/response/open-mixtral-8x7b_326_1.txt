Let's analyze the information given:

A. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

B. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attacker's height is unknown, we cannot directly estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies. However, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses making a mistake and stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not.

The probability of Witness 1 making a mistake is 20%, and the probability of Witness 2 making a mistake is 30%. Since they made their mistakes independently, we can calculate the combined probability by multiplying the probabilities:

P(Both make a mistake) = P(Witness 1 makes a mistake) * P(Witness 2 makes a mistake)
P(Both make a mistake) = 0.2 * 0.3
P(Both make a mistake) = 0.06 or 6%

However, this is not the final answer to the question, as it does not directly estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This answer only estimates the probability of both witnesses making a mistake regarding the attacker's height. Given the information available, it's not possible to provide a more accurate estimate.

So, I will answer the question strictly in the following format:

{probability: it's not possible to provide a probability based on the given information}
