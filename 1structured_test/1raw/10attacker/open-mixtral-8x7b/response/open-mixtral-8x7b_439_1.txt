To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement and then combine these probabilities using the law of total probability.

First, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. Since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and was correct 80% of the time, we have:
