Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. We don't have any information about the second witness's statement affecting the first witness's statement, so we can ignore the second witness's statement for this particular question.
5. Therefore, given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that this statement is correct.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
