Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given these points, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's correct identification rate)
- P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion where height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (1 - witness 1's correct identification rate, or the error rate)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (population proportion where height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

{probability: 0.36}
