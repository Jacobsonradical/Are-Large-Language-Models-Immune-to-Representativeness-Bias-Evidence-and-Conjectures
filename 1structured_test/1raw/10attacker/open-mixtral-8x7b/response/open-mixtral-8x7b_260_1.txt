Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

Witness 1: Since we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of them being correct is 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35.

Witness 2: Similarly, since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and this witness is correct 70% of the time, the probability of them being correct is 0.85 * 0.7 + 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.595 + 0.045 = 0.64.

However, these two events contradict each other, so we cannot simply multiply these probabilities together. Instead, we need to consider the probability that they are both correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) versus the probability that they are both incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Probability of both being correct: 0.35 (witness 1) * 0.64 (witness 2) = 0.224

Probability of both being incorrect: 0.65 (1-witness 1 accuracy) * 0.36 (1-witness 2 accuracy) = 0.234

Since these are the only two possibilities, we can divide the first probability by the sum of both to get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.224 / (0.224 + 0.234) = 0.4887, or approximately 49%}
