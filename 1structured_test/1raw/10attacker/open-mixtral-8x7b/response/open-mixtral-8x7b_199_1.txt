To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement and then combine them using the weights of their reliability.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(A185cm)

Where:
A185cm = Attacker is 185 cm or taller

Now, let's calculate P(A185cm | W1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the statement of the first witness. Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(A185cm | W1) = 1

Next, let's calculate P(A185cm | W2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the statement of the second witness. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(A185cm | W2) = P(A185cm) = 0.15 (from the city's population statistics)

Now, let's calculate the combined probability based on the reliability of each witness. We have:

P(W1) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy in identifying a person's height)
P(W2) = 0.7 (second witness's accuracy in identifying a person's height)

Using the law of total probability:

P(A185cm) = P(A185cm | W1) * P(W1) + P(A185cm | W2) * P(W2)
P(A185cm) = (1 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.7) = 0.8 + 0.105 = 0.905

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.905}
