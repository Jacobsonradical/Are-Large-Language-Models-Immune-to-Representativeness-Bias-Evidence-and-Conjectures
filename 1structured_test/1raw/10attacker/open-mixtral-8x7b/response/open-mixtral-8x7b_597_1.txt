Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 0.8 (80%).

Next, let's calculate the probability that the second witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This probability is given as 0.7 (70%).

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct given their claims. This would mean that the first witness correctly identified an 185 cm or taller person and the second witness correctly identified a person shorter than 185 cm.

The probability for this scenario is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%.

However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. So, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness is correct (as stated above, 0.8) and add to it the probability that both witnesses are incorrect but the first witness would have been correct if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

The probability that both witnesses are incorrect is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6% (the first witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller and the second witness incorrectly identified a person as shorter than 185 cm).

The probability that the first witness is correct given that both witnesses are incorrect is 0.8 (since she would have been correct in 80% of the cases where she identified someone as 185 cm or taller).

So, the probability we are looking for is 0.8 (first witness correct) + 0.06 (both incorrect and first witness correct) = 0.86 or 86%.
