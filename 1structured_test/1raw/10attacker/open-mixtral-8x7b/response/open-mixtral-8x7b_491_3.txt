To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the individual probabilities of the first and second witnesses being correct.
2. Combine these probabilities using conditional probability.

First, let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and P(¬A) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the first witness's accuracy:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person)
- P(¬W1|¬A) = 0.8 (first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

Given the second witness's accuracy:
- P(W2|A) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person)
- P(¬W2|¬A) = 0.7 (second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

Now, we use the fact that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(¬A) = 0.85

Using conditional probability:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

Calculate P(W1):
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(¬W1|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, calculate P(A|W1):
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

Therefore, based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
