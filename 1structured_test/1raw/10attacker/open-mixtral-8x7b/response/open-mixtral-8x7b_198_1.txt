Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

To find this probability, we need to consider both the accuracy of the first witness and the prior probability based on the city's population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem to combine these two probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

First, calculate P(W1|¬A):
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, calculate P(¬A):
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = [(0.8) * (0.15)] / [((0.8) * (0.15)) + ((0.2) * (0.85))]
P(A|W1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
