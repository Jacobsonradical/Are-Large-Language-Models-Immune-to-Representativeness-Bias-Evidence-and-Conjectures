Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements are contradictory, at least one of them must be wrong.
3. Let's consider the first witness's accuracy: they are correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.
4. Now let's determine the probability that the first witness is correct in this case, given that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
5. According to the city's population statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness is correct, is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate).
7. However, we need to find the probability that the first witness is correct, given that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
8. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
   where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
9. We know the values for P(B|A) (0.8, the first witness's accuracy rate), P(A) (0.15, the city's population statistics), and P(B) (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
10. Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time, the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.
11. Therefore, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.395.
12. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
   P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.395 â‰ˆ 0.304

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.304.
