Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, W1 and W2. W1 says the attacker is 185cm or taller, and is correct 80% of the time. W2 says the attacker is shorter than 185cm, and is correct 70% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185cm and 15% are 185cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller, as W1 claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of W1 being correct, given that she claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

P(W1 is correct | W1 claims 185cm or taller) = P(W1 claims 185cm or taller AND attacker is 185cm or taller) / P(W1 claims 185cm or taller)

From the information given, W1 claims 185cm or taller with a probability of 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance of picking someone 185cm or taller).

P(W1 claims 185cm or taller AND attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.5 * 0.15 = 0.075 (probability of picking a person who is 185cm or taller and W1 being correct)

Now we can compute P(W1 is correct | W1 claims 185cm or taller):

P(W1 is correct | W1 claims 185cm or taller) = 0.075 / 0.5 = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed, is:

{probability: 0.15}
