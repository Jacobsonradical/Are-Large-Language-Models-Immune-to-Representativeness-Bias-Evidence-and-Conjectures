Let's reason through this:

We know that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.

Let's denote:
T = The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1T = The event that witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(T|W1T), the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 said so.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W1T) = P(W1T|T) * P(T) / P(W1T)

We're given P(W1T|T) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time), and from the population statistics, we're given P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W1T), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1T) = P(W1T|T) * P(T) + P(W1T|not T) * P(not T)

We're given P(W1T|T) = 0.8 and P(T) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(not T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85.

We need to find P(W1T|not T), the probability that the witness says the height is 185 cm or taller when it's not. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20%, so P(W1T|not T) = 0.2.

So, P(W1T) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(T|W1T):

P(T|W1T) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
