Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' claims are conflicting, we cannot use the information from both to increase our estimate of the attacker's height. We must consider each statement separately.
3. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is consistent with 15% of the city's population.
4. However, the first witness is only correct 80% of the time when judging a person's height under similar conditions.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = P(first witness's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 1
