Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(W1Correct) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(W2Correct) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Given that witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(AttackerTall | W1Tall) = [P(W1Tall | AttackerTall) * P(AttackerTall)] / P(W1Tall)

P(AttackerTall) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W1Tall | AttackerTall) = 0.8 (since witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)

To calculate P(W1Tall), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is tall, or the attacker is short. We can use the law of total probability:

P(W1Tall) = P(W1Tall | AttackerTall) * P(AttackerTall) + P(W1Tall | AttackerShort) * P(AttackerShort)

P(W1Tall | AttackerShort) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (since witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people 20% of the time)
P(AttackerShort) = 1 - P(AttackerTall) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W1Tall):

P(W1Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 said so:

P(AttackerTall | W1Tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
