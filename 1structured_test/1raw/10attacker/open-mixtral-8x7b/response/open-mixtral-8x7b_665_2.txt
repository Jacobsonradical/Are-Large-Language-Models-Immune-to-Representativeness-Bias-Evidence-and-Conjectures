Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time randomly.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which happens 85% of the time randomly.
5. But the second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.
6. Given that both witnesses' claims seem to contradict each other, we should consider the more reliable witness.
7. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when claiming someone is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time, we can estimate the probability based on these numbers.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: {probability: 0.8}
