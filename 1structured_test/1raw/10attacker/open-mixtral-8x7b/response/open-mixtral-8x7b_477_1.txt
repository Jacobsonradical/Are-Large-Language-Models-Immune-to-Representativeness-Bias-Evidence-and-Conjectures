Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the two witnesses:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

However, we also need to take into account the information from Witness 2. Since Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we need to calculate the probability that both witnesses are wrong:

P(Both witnesses are wrong) = P(Witness 1 is wrong) * P(Witness 2 is wrong)
= 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.06

To estimate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to subtract the probability that both witnesses are wrong from the initial probability:

Overall probability = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) - P(Both witnesses are wrong)
= 0.12 - 0.06
= 0.06

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.06}
