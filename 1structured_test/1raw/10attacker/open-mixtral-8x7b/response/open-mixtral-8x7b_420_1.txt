Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (15% probability).
- B is the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we need to calculate the combined probability that B happens if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the probability that B happens if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Calculating each component:
- P(B|A) = 80% (first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 15% (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 20% * (1-15%) = 20% * 85% = 17% (first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 85% (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4535

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4535}
