To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1 is the event that the first witness is correct
- B2 is the event that the first witness is incorrect

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:

- P(A|B1) = 1, since the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(B1) = 0.8, since the first witness is correct 80% of the time
- P(B2) = 1 - P(B1) = 0.2, since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time
- P(A|B2) = 0.15, since the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller with probability 15%
- P(B1'|A) = 0.2, since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

Using the formula for total probability, we get:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)
= (1)(0.8) + (0.15)(0.2)
= 0.8 + 0.03
= 0.83

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.83}
