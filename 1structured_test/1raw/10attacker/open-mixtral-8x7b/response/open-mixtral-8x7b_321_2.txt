Let's break down the problem and reason through it:

1. We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in making correct estimates. So, their claim has an 80% probability of being correct.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate in making correct estimates. So, their claim has a 70% probability of being correct.
4. Since both witnesses made contradictory statements, we cannot rely on their individual success rates to determine the attacker's actual height.
5. Instead, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses making a mistake (claiming different heights when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
6. The probability of both witnesses making a mistake is the product of their individual error rates: (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.7) = 0.06 or 6%
7. Therefore, the probability of neither witness making a mistake is 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 or 94%

So, based on the given information, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.94}.
