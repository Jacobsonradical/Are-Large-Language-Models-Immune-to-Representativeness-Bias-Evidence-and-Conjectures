Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(W1Correct) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect) = 1 - P(W1Correct) = 0.2

P(W2Correct) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect) = 1 - P(W2Correct) = 0.3

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements:

P(Tall | W1Tall, W2Short) = P(W1Correct | Tall) * P(W2Incorrect | Tall) * P(Tall) / P(W1Correct | Tall) * P(W2Incorrect | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(W1Incorrect | Tall) * P(W2Correct | Tall) * P(Tall) + P(W1Incorrect | Short) * P(W2Incorrect | Short) * P(Short)

From the information provided, there are two groups in the population: tall (185 cm or taller) with a 15% probability, and short (shorter than 185 cm) with an 85% probability:

P(Tall) = 0.15
P(Short) = 0.85

Now, let's calculate the conditional probabilities using the law of total probability, assuming the witnesses' abilities to judge heights remain consistent:

P(W1Correct | Tall) = P(W1Correct) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect | Tall) = P(W1Incorrect) = 0.2

P(W2Correct | Tall) = 1 - P(W2Incorrect | Tall) = 1 - P(W2Incorrect) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect | Tall) = 0.3

P(W1Incorrect | Short) = 1 - P(W1Incorrect | Short) = 1 - P(W1Incorrect) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect | Short) = 0.2

P(W2Correct | Short) = 1 - P(W2Incorrect | Short) = 1 - P(W2Incorrect) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect | Short) = 0.3

Now, we can substitute all these values into the formula:

P(Tall | W1Tall, W2Short) = (0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.7 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)) = 0.24

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
