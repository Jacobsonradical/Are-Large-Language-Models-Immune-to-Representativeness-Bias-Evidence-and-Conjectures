Let's reason through this:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Since this witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance this is correct and a 20% chance this witness erred.
3. If the witness erred, it would mean the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, which is the case for 85% of the population according to the city statistics.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

1. The probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
2. The probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 * 0.85 (20% chance of error multiplied by the 85% of population that is shorter than 185 cm).

Adding these two probabilities together will give us the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

Probability = 0.8 + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97 or 97%

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.97}
