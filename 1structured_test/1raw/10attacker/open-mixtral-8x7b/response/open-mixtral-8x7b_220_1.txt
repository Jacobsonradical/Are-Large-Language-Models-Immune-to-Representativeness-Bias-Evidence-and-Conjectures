Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% is 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and we know this witness is correct 70% of the time.
5. Given these conditions, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- not A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- B is the event that one witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the other witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15
- P(not A) = 85% = 0.85
- P(B|A) = 80% = 0.8 (first witness correct)
- P(B|not A) = 30% = 0.3 (second witness incorrect)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(A|B) = 0.3181818...

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32 (rounded to two decimal places)}
