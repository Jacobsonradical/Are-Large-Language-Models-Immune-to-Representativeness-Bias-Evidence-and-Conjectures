To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence.

Let's define our terms:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E: the evidence that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed this.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(H|E) from the following probabilities:

* P(H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(E|H): the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(~H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(E|~H): the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:

* P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(E|H) = 1 (if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the witness will always claim this)
* P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the witness will claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [P(H) \* P(E|H)] / [P(H) \* P(E|H) + P(~H) \* P(E|~H)]
= [0.15 \* 1] / [0.15 \* 1 + 0.85 \* 0.2]
= 0.4286

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 42.86%.
