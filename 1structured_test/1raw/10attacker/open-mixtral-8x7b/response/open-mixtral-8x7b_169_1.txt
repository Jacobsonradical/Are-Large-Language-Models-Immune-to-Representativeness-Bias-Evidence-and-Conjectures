Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given their claim and their error rate.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case:
A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B = Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

We are given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
- Attacker is 185 cm or taller, and Witness 1 is correct
- Attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and Witness 1 incorrectly claims they are 185 cm or taller

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We need to find P(B|not A), the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since Witness 1 is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(B) = 0.29

Now we have all the values to calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
