Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Given the first witness's 80% accuracy in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, one might initially think that the probability is 0.8. However, we must also consider the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness.

In order to calculate the probability, we need to find the probability that both witnesses are correct in their claims, given their individual accuracy rates. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B and C be the events that witness 1 and 2 are correct, respectively.

We want to find P(A|B ∩ C), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses are correct.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C|A) * P(A) / P(B ∩ C)

First, let's find P(B ∩ C|A), the probability of both witnesses being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is always correct when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) = 1. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(C|A) = 0.7. Since these are independent events, we can multiply them to find P(B ∩ C|A) = 0.7.

Next, let's find P(A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information given, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B ∩ C), the probability of both witnesses being correct. We can find this by calculating the weighted sum of the probabilities of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is either shorter or taller than 185 cm.

P(B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C|A) * P(A) + P(B ∩ C|¬A) * P(¬A)

We already know P(B ∩ C|A) and P(A). To find P(B ∩ C|¬A), the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can multiply the individual accuracy rates of both witnesses: P(B ∩ C|¬A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56. The probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is P(¬A) = 0.85.

Now, we can calculate P(B ∩ C):

P(B ∩ C) = 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.56 * 0.85 = 0.336 + 0.476 = 0.812

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B ∩ C):

P(A|B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C|A) * P(A) / P(B ∩ C) = 0.7 * 0.15 / 0.812 ≈ 0.131

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.131.
