Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification in 80% of cases.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which also aligns with their correct identification in 70% of cases.

Given these circumstances, it seems more likely that Witness 1 is correct because their error rate is lower when identifying tall individuals. However, we cannot determine the exact height of the attacker based on the given information.

To provide a numerical answer, let's calculate the probability based on Witness 1's claim:
{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2, because the final estimate should be a weighted average of the probability of Witness 1 being correct when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (0.15 * 0.8), and the probability of Witness 1 being incorrect but Witness 2 being correct when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.85 * 0.2)}

So, {probability: 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35}.
