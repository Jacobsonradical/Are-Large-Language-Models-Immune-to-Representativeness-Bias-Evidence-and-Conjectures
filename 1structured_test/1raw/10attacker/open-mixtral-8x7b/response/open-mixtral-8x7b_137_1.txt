Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 be the event that witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let W2 be the event that witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 1
