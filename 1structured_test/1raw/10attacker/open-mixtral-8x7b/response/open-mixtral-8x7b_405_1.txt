Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. 

Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we are interested in the probability that the first witness is correct. 

Given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there are two possibilities: 
1. The first witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability of the first scenario. 

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

We know that P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% based on the city's population.

To find P(B), we need to consider all the scenarios where the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (with a probability of 15%), and when the first witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (with a probability of 20%).

So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 80% * 15% + 20% * 85% = 23%.

Now, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 80% * 15% / 23% = 52.17% (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 52.17%.

Answer: {probability: 0.52, explanation: "The probability is approximately 52.17%."}
