Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 made that claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), so let's calculate each term:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(not B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 (Witness 1 is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

Now we can calculate P(not B|not A) = 0.3 (Witness 1 erred in 30% of the cases when the attacker was not 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.276

So our estimate is:

{probability: 0.276}
