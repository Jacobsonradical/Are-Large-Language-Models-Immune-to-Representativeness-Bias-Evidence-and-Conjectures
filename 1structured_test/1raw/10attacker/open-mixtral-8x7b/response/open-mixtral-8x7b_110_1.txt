Let's analyze the given information:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) The population statistics tell us that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:

Probability(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Let's denote Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller) as P1 and Probability(attacker is 185 cm or taller) as P2.

P1 = Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P2 + Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * (1 - P2)

Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since witness 1 is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (since witness 1 errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P1 = (1 * P2) + (0.2 * (1 - P2))

To estimate P2, we need to use the law of total probability:

P2 = Probability(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) + Probability(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

P2 = P1 * P2 + (1 - P1) * 0.15 (using the complement probability for attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can solve for P2:

P2 - P1 * P2 = 0.15 * (1 - P1)

P2 (1 - P1) = 0.15 - 0.15 * P1

P2 = (0.15 - 0.15 * P1) / (1 - P1)

Substitute P2 in P1:

P1 = (1 * ((0.15 - 0.15 * P1) / (1 - P1))) + (0.2 * (1 - ((0.15 - 0.15 * P1) / (1 - P1))))

Solve for P1:

P1 ≈ 0.24

Now, estimate P2:

P2 ≈ (0.15 - 0.15 * 0.24) / (1 - 0.24)
P2 ≈ 0.18

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.18}
