Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' claims are contradictory, at most one of them can be correct.
3. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with 80% probability according to the information provided.
4. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is not, given the first witness's statement, can be calculated as follows:
   P(A and not B | A) = P(A) * P(not B | A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.56}
