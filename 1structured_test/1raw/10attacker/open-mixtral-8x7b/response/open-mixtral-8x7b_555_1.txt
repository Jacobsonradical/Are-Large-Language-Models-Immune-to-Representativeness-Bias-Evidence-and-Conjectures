To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This law allows us to break down the overall probability into parts based on the information provided by each witness.

First, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(Tall | W1 Tall) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(Short | W1 Tall) = 1 - P(Tall | W1 Tall) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, we need to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the second witness claims they are shorter:
P(Tall | W2 Short) = 0.15 (population proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller)

We can now use the law of total probability to calculate the overall probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:

P(Tall) = P(Tall | W1 Tall) * P(W1 Tall) + P(Tall | W2 Short) * P(W2 Short)

We know P(Tall | W1 Tall) and P(Tall | W2 Short). To find P(W1 Tall) and P(W2 Short), we need to calculate the probability of each witness being correct given the population distribution:

P(W1 Tall) = P(Tall) = 0.15 (from part b)
P(W2 Short) = P(Short) = 0.85 (from part b)

Now we can calculate P(Tall):
P(Tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.15 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1275 = 0.2475

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2475}
