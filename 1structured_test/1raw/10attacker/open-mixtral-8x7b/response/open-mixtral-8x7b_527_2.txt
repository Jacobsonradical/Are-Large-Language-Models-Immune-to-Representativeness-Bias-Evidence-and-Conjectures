Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.
b) We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so we want to find the probability of this being true. We can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = first witness's correct rate = 0.8
- P(B|not A) = first witness's error rate = 0.2
- P(A) = probability of a person being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(not A) = probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Now, we can substitute these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
