Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, W1 and W2. W1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and is correct 80% of the time. W2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and is correct 70% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed.

To calculate this, we need to consider both witnesses' testimonies. If either witness is correct, then the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

The probability that W1 is correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that W2 is correct is 0.7 (70%). However, since W2's testimony contradicts W1's, we cannot simply add their probabilities together.

Instead, we need to calculate the probability that W2 is incorrect, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (30%).

Now, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses contradict each other:
P(W1 correct) * P(W2 incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Finally, we subtract this contradiction probability from the probability that W1 is correct:
Estimated probability = 0.8 - 0.24 = 0.56

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed, is:

{probability: 0.56}
