To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' accuracy and the population statistics to calculate the likelihood of both witnesses making a correct identification, or one making a correct identification and the other making an error.

First, let's calculate the probability of the first witness making a correct identification, which is 80%. We can represent this as P(C1), where C1 is the event of the first witness making a correct identification.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness making a correct identification, which is 70%. We can represent this as P(C2), where C2 is the event of the second witness making a correct identification.

However, since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we also need to calculate the probability of this witness making an error, which is 30%. We can represent this as P(E2), where E2 is the event of the second witness making an error.

Now, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses making a correct identification:

P(C1 ∩ C2) = P(C1) * P(C2)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Next, we can calculate the probability of the first witness making a correct identification and the second witness making an error:

P(C1 ∩ E2) = P(C1) * P(E2)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is the sum of these two probabilities:

P(at least 185 cm | C1 and C2 or C1 and E2) = P(C1 ∩ C2) + P(C1 ∩ E2)
= 0.56 + 0.24
= 0.80

However, we also need to take into account the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% of the population. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(at least 185 cm | C1 and C2 or C1 and E2) = P(C1 ∩ C2 or C1 ∩ E2) * P(at least 185 cm) / P(C1 and C2 or C1 and E2)

First, let's calculate P(C1 and C2 or C1 and E2):

P(C1 and C2 or C1 and E2) = P(C1 ∩ C2) + P(C1 ∩ E2)
= 0.56 + 0.24
= 0.80

Now, we can find the posterior probability:

P(at least 185 cm | C1 and C2 or C1 and E2) = (0.80) * (0.15) / (0.80)
= 0.12

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12.
