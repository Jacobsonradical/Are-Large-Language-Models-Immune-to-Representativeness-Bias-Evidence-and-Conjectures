Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be correct if the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller (a probability of 15% based on the city's population) and the witness correctly identified the attacker's height (a probability of 80%).
5. Therefore, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities: 15% * 80% = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
