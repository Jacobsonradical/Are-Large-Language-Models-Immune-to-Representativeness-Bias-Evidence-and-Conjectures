Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be written as:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness 1's claim)

We are given P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).

We are also given P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(witness 1's claim), we need to consider all possibilities, i.e., when the attacker is and is not 185 cm or taller:

P(witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1's claim AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1's claim AND attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1's claim | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
