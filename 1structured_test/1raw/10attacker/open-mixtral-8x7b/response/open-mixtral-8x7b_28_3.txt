Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller."

We are given the following probabilities:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)
- P(A) = 0.15 (population percentage with height 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 1
