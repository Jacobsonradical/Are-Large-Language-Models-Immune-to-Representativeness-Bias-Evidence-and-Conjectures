Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness. We cannot use the second witness's statement to help us in this case.
3. Using the first witness's statement alone, we know that they are correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.
4. Therefore, given the first witness's claim and their ability to correctly identify someone as 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability as 0.8 (or 80%).

{probability: 0.8}
