Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given their claim and accuracy:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct)
= 0.8 (80% accuracy)

However, this doesn't take into account the information from Witness 2 or the population statistics. To incorporate this information, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents "Attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B represents "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller".

We have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1's accuracy)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (Witness 1's error rate)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's compute the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.36}
