Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

To do this, we need to find the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller.

P(W1=185cm or taller) * P(W2=185cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

So, given the information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.56 or 56%.
