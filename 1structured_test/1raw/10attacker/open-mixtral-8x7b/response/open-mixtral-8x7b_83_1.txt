Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the two witnesses.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct 80% of the time in such judgments.
3. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The second witness is correct 70% of the time in such judgments.

Let's denote:
A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1 = First witness is correct
W2 = Second witness is correct

We want to find P(A|W1) which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We know:
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(W1), we need to consider two possibilities:
a) The attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens with probability P(A) = 0.15, and in this case, the first witness is correct with probability 0.8.
b) The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which happens with probability P(not A) = 0.85, and in this case, the first witness is correct with probability 0.2 (because the witness thinks the attacker is taller).

So, P(W1) = P(W1 and A) + P(W1 and not A) = P(A) * P(W1|A) + P(not A) * P(W1|not A) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.27

Now, we can calculate P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.27 = 0.3333

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3333}
