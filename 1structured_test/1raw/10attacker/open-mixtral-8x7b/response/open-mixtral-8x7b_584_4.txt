Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(1st witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7
P(2nd witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, let's consider the population statistics. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is:

P(tall) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Given the two witnesses and their abilities to judge height, and the population statistics, we now want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

We can calculate this probability as follows:

P(tall | 1st witness claim) = P(1st witness correct & tall) / P(1st witness correct)

P(1st witness correct & tall) = P(tall) * P(1st witness correct | tall)
P(1st witness correct | tall) = 1 (since the first witness claimed tall, and the person was indeed tall)

By substitution:

P(tall | 1st witness claim) = P(tall) * 1 / P(1st witness correct) = 0.15 * 1 / 0.8 = 0.1875

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1875}
