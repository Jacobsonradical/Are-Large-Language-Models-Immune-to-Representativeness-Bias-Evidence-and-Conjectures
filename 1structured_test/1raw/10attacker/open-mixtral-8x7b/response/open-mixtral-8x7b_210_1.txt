Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness, assuming that the first witness is always correct. This probability is given by the city's population statistics:

P(tall | witness1) = P(witness1 | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness1)

We are given P(witness1 | tall) = 0.8, P(tall) = 0.15, and we need to find P(witness1), which is the total probability of witnessing a tall person. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% or taller, we have:

P(witness1) = P(witness1 | tall) * P(tall) + P(witness1 | short) * P(short)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(tall | witness1):

P(tall | witness1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.379

However, we also need to account for the inaccuracy of the first witness. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time, and assuming that the error rate is the same for both tall and short people:

P(tall | witness1) = 0.8 * P(tall) + 0.2 * P(short)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate the final probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:

P(tall | witness1) = P(witness1 | tall) * P(tall) / P(witness1)
= 0.8 * 0.29 / (0.8 * 0.29 + 0.2 * 0.71)
= 0.232 / (0.232 + 0.142)
= 0.232 / 0.374
≈ 0.6209

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6209}
