Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we should consider the cases where this witness is correct. We can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct as follows:

P(1st witness correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(1st witness correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(1st witness correct | attacker is shorter than 1
