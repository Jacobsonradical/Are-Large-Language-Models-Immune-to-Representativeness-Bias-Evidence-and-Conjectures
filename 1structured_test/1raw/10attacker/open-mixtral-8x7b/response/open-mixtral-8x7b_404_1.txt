Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.
3. However, given that the attack happened at night and the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can't directly use this probability. Instead, we need to consider the two witnesses' testimonies together.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Given the second witness's 70% accuracy, there's only a 30% chance they're wrong about the attacker's height.
5. Since the two testimonies contradict each other, we're in a situation where one of the witnesses must be wrong. Given that the second witness has a 30% error rate, there's a 0.3 chance that they're incorrect and a 0.7 chance that they're correct.
6. But since they claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, this implies that the first witness, who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, must be wrong 30% of the time.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.7 (or 70%). This is the probability that the first witness is correct given that the second witness is incorrect.
