To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where:
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(A|B1) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness is correct
- P(B1) is the probability that the first witness is correct
- P(A|B2) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness is incorrect
- P(B2) is the probability that the first witness is incorrect

From the information given, we know that P(B1) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time) and P(B2) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time). We also know that P(A|B1) = 1 (if the first witness is correct and said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, then the attacker must be 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(A|B2), we need to consider the second witness. If the first witness is incorrect, then the attacker must be shorter than 185 cm, so P(A|B2) = P(the second witness is incorrect and says the attacker is taller than 185 cm) = P(the second witness is incorrect) * P(the second witness says the attacker is taller than 185 cm | the second witness is incorrect) = 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time, and if they are incorrect, they have a 50% chance of saying the attacker is taller than 185 cm).

Putting it all together, we get:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2) = (1 * 0.8) + (0.15 * 0.2) = 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.83.
