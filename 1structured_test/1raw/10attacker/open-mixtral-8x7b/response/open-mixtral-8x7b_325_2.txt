Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
3. To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" and be correct, as well as the probability that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" and be incorrect.
4. The probability that the first witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the population distribution) * 0.8 (first witness correct rate) = 0.12 or 12%.
5. The probability that the first witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (population distribution of people shorter than 185 cm) * 0.2 (first witness incorrect rate) = 0.17 or 17%.

Now we know the two probabilities, we can calculate the final estimate:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is the probability that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" and be correct (0.12) divided by the sum of probabilities that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" and be correct (0.12) and the probability that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" and be incorrect (0.17).

This is equal to 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 or 41%.

{probability: 0.41}
