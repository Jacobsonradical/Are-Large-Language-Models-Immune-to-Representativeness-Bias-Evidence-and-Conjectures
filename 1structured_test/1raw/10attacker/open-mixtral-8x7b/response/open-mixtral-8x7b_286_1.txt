Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

Witness 1: P(Correct) = 0.8, P(Error) = 0.2
Witness 2: P(Correct) = 0.7, P(Error) = 0.3

Now, let's calculate the combined probability of both witnesses being correct:
P(Both Correct) = P(Correct1) * P(Correct2) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Next, we'll calculate the combined probability of Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being incorrect:
P(Correct1 and Error2) = P(Correct1) * P(Error2) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, let's use the given population data to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Finally, we'll calculate the probability of both conditions being true:
P(Both Conditions) = P(Both Correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Correct1 and Error2) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.56 * 0.15) + (0.24 * 0.15) = 0.144 + 0.036 = 0.18

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.18}
