Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Since we don't have the exact height, we can only work with the probabilities.
3. According to the first statement, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
5. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness's claim) = P(First witness's claim is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.12}
