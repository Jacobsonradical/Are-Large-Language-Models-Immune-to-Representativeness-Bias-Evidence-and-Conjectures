To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability of each witness's statement being true, and then weighting them by their accuracy.

From statement a, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, let's consider the first witness who claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since we're trying to find the probability of this statement being true, we'll condition our probability on this statement. The probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from statement b). The probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller (when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) is 0.2 (from statement b).

Similarly, let's consider the second witness who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The probability that the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm is 0.7 (from statement b). The probability that the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm (when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) is 0.3 (from statement b).

Now, we can use the law of total probability to calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness's statement) = P(First witness correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(First witness incorrect) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

= (0.8)*(0.15) + (1-0.8)*(1-0.15)

= 0.15 + 0.24

= 0.39

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.39.
