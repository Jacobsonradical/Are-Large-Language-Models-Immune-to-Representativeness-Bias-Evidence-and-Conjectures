Let's first calculate the likelihoods of the first witness being correct and incorrect:

P(W1_correct) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1_incorrect) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 1
