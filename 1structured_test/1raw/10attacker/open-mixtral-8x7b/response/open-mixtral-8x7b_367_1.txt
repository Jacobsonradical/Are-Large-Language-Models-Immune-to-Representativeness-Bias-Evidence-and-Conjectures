Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, which is 80% or 0.8. 
P(A) is the prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases:
- The case where the attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
- The case where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(B) = P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 (¬A denotes the complementary event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Hence, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate our desired probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

{probability: 0.414}
