Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the information provided.
2. We have two witnesses, A and B, who have different success rates in estimating height.
3. Witness A says the attacker is 185cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
4. Witness B says the attacker is shorter than 185cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
5. To calculate the probability that Witness A is correct, we multiply the probability of Witness A being correct (0.8) with the base rate of people who are 185cm or taller in the population (0.15). This gives us 0.12 or 12%.
6. However, this doesn't take into account the testimony of Witness B. If Witness B is correct (which they are 70% of the time), then the attacker must be less than 185cm tall.
7. Since we're trying to find the probability that Witness A is correct, we need to consider that Witness B could be wrong. The probability of Witness B being wrong is 0.3 (30%).
8. Therefore, the probability of both witnesses being wrong is the product of their individual error rates, which is 0.24 (24%).
9. To get the final probability estimate, we add the probability of Witness A being correct (0.12) to the probability of both witnesses being wrong (0.24).

{probability: 0.36 or 36%}
