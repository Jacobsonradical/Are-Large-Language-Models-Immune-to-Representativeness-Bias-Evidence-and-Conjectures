Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating whether someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. The population of the city is such that 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
3. However, we don't have information about the exact height distribution of people in the city, only that there are fewer tall people.
4. Despite this, we can still estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim.

Let's calculate the probability:
Since the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, we can assume that when they say the person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that this is true.

Given that, our answer would be:
{probability: 0.8}

This conclusion assumes that the distribution of heights in the general population is similar to the distribution of heights among people who would be out at night in the city where the attack occurred.
