Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by both witnesses.
2. Since the two witnesses have different success rates in estimating a person's height, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.
3. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B and C represent the events where witness 1 and witness 2 are correct, respectively.
4. We want to find P(A|B ∩ C), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses agree on the height.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write: P(A|B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C|A) * P(A) / P(B ∩ C)
6. P(B ∩ C|A) is the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the product of their individual success rates: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
7. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
8. To calculate P(B ∩ C), we can use the law of total probability: P(B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C|A) * P(A) + P(B ∩ C|A') * P(A')
9. Here, A' represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.
10. Calculating P(B ∩ C|A') requires considering the cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and both witnesses are incorrect. This can be calculated as: P(B ∩ C|A') = (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.7) / 2 = 0.075
11. Plugging these values into the equation for P(B ∩ C), we get: P(B ∩ C) = 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.075 * 0.85 = 0.1405
12. Finally, we can calculate P(A|B ∩ C): P(A|B ∩ C) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.1405 ≈ 0.703

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.703}.
