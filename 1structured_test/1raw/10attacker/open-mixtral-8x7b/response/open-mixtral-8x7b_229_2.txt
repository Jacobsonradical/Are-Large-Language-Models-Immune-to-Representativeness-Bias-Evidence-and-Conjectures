Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so:

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

The event "Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller" can be broken down into two cases: when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and when the witness errs in their claim. So, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 1 claims correctly) + P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and Witness 1 claims incorrectly)

Plugging in the numbers:

P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

Now, we can calculate the final probability:

P(Taller than or equal to 185 cm | Witness 1's claim) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 1 claims correctly) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.5 * 0.8) / 0.5 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
