Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- W1 as the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- W2 as the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we need to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

We can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We're given P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we need to find P(W1).

P(W1) can be calculated as:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)

We're given P(W1|A) = 0.8 and P(¬A) = 0.85, and we can find P(W1|¬A) using the second witness information:

P(W1|¬A) = 1 - P(W2|¬A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Finally, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 = 0.096 / 0.375 ≈ 0.2564

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2564.
