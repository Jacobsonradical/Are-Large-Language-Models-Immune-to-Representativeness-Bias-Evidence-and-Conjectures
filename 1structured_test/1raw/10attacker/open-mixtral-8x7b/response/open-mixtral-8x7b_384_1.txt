To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following reasoning:

1. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. We have the following probabilities from the given information:
   a) P(W1_correct) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time)
   b) P(W2_correct) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time)
   c) P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   d) P(A' ) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. We can now calculate the probabilities of the following scenarios:
   a) Both witnesses are correct: P(W1_correct ∩ W2_correct) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56
   b) Only the first witness is correct: P(W1_correct ∩ W2_incorrect) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24
4. Since the witnesses disagree, we know that at least one of them must be incorrect. Therefore, we need the probability of the scenario where only the first witness is correct.
5. To find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so, we can use Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|W1_correct ∩ W2_incorrect) = P(W1_correct ∩ W2_incorrect|A) * P(A) / P(W1_correct ∩ W2_incorrect) 
   = (P(W1_correct) * P(W2_incorrect|A)) * P(A) / P(W1_correct ∩ W2_incorrect)
   = (0.8 * 0.2) * 0.15 / 0.24
   = 0.12 / 0.24
   = 0.5

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5}
