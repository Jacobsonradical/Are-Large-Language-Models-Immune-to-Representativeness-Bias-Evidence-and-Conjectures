To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will calculate P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (A) given the evidence (B) from the two witnesses and population statistics.

First, let's define our terms:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: Second witness says attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(A): Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on population statistics (15%)
- P(B1|A): Probability of first witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller (80%)
- P(B1|¬A): Probability of first witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller (100% - 80% = 20%)
- P(B2|A): Probability of second witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm (100% - 70% = 30%)
- P(B2|¬A): Probability of second witness correctly identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm (70%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * (1 - P(A))]

P(B1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(B1|¬A) * (1 - P(A)) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

P(A|B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
