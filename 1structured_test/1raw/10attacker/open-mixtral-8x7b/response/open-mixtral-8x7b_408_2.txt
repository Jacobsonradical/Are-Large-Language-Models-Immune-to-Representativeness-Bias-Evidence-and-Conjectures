Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so:

1. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made a correct assessment, is 1 (100%).
2. However, we know that Witness 1 can be wrong 20% of the time. So, we need to factor in this error rate.
3. The overall probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probability that Witness 1 is correct and claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the probability that Witness 1 is incorrect and still claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. The probability that Witness 1 is correct and claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15%) multiplied by the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a person of that height (80%). This gives us 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.
5. The probability that Witness 1 is incorrect and still claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the height of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (85%) multiplied by the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (20%). This gives us 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 or 17%.

Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.29}.
