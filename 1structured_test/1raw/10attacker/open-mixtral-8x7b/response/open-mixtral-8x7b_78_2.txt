To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are A: "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B: "the first witness claimed that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller". We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

According to the problem, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. The probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is P(B|A) = 0.8, because the first witness correctly identifies the height in such cases 80% of the time.

Now we need to find P(B), the overall probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two probabilities: when the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, and when the attacker's height is not, but the first witness incorrectly thinks it is.

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + P(B|A') * 0.85, where A' is the complementary event of A (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm), and P(B|A') is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

The problem states that the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. Since the first witness claimed the height was 185 cm or taller, and there are only two categories, this means that 20% of the time, the first witness thinks the height is 185 cm or taller when it is not. Therefore, P(B|A') = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
