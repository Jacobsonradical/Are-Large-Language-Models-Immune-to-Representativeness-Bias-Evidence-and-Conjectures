Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we can use Bayes' theorem.
5. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the evidence provided by the witnesses.
6. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.
7. According to Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
8. We are given P(B|A) (the accuracy of Witness 1), and we can calculate P(A) using the city's population data.
9. To calculate P(B), we need to find the probabilities of the witnesses' statements under both scenarios (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).

Calculations:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1's accuracy)

P(B'|A') = 0.7 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.595 (Witness 2's accuracy, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B'|A) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.215 (Witness 2's accuracy, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(B) = P(B'|A) * P(A) + P(B'|A') * P(A') = 0.215 + 0.595 = 0.81

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.81 â‰ˆ 0.148

The final answer is: {probability: 0.148}
