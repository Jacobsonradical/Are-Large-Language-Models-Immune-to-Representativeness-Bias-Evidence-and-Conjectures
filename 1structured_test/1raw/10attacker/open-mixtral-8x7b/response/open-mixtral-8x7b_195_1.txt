Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given these probabilities, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

The first term on the right side of the equation is:
P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 × 0.15 = 0.12

The second term, using the formula for the complement, is:
P(witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is not 185 cm or taller) × P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 × 0.85 = 0.17

So, the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

{probability: 0.29}
