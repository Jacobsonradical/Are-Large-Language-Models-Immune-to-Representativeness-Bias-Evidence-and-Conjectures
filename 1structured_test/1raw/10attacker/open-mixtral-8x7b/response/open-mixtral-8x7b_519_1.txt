Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 corr) = probability that the first witness is correct = 0.8
P(W2 corr) = probability that the second witness is correct = 0.7

Now, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller, given that only one of them is correct:

P(W1 = 185cm | W1 corr) = 1 (first witness said so and we assume they're correct)
P(W2 < 185cm | W2 corr) = 0.5 (second witness said so and we assume they made an error)

P(W1 = 185cm and W2 < 185cm) = P(W1 = 185cm | W1 corr) * P(W1 corr) * P(W2 < 185cm | W2 corr) * P(W2 corr) = (1)*(0.8)*(0.5)*(0.7) = 0.28

Now, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker's height was less than 185cm, given that only one of them is correct:

P(W1 < 185cm | W1 corr) = 1 (first witness said so and we assume they made an error)
P(W2 = 185cm | W2 corr) = 0.5 (second witness said so and we assume they're correct)

P(W1 < 185cm and W2 = 185cm) = P(W1 < 185cm | W1 corr) * P(W1 corr) * P(W2 = 185cm | W2 corr) * P(W2 corr) = (1)*(0.8)*(0.5)*(0.7) = 0.28

The total probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller is the sum of the two probabilities calculated above:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller) = P(W1 = 185cm and W2 < 185cm) + P(W1 < 185cm and W2 = 185cm) = 0.28 + 0.28 = 0.56

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.56}.
