Let's break down the information given:

1. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
2. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
3. In the city's population, 85% are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses would be correct if the attacker's height were 185 cm or taller:

P(both correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness 1 correct) * P(witness 2 correct)
= 0.8 * 0.3 (since witness 2 is correct when they claim the person is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.24

Next, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses would be correct if the attacker's height were shorter than 185 cm:

P(both correct | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(witness 1 incorrect) * P(witness 2 correct)
= 0.2 * 0.7
= 0.14

Now, we need to calculate the total probability for both scenarios and compare them to determine which is more likely:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(both correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population)
= 0.24 * 0.15
= 0.036

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(both correct | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm in the population)
= 0.14 * 0.85
= 0.119

Given the information, it is more likely that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

So, {probability: 0.036} for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, based on witness 1's claim.
