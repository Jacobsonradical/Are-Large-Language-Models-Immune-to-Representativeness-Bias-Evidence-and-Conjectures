Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
3. Here, A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the observation that the first witness said the attacker was 1
