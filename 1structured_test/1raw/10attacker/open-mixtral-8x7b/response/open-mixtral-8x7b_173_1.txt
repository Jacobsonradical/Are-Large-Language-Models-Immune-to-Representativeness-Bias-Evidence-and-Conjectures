Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of each witness being correct:

Witness 1 correct probability (P1) = 0.8
Witness 2 correct probability (P2) = 0.7

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct when they agree that the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(both correct) = P1 * P2 = (0.8) * (0.7) = 0.56

Now, let's find the probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 15% chance that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.

P(both say 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (first witness) * 0.15 (second witness) = 0.0225

Now we can find the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses agree:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both say 185 cm or taller) = P(both correct) * P(both say 185 cm or taller) / P(both say 185 cm or taller)
= 0.56 * 0.0225 / 0.0225
= 0.56

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.56.
