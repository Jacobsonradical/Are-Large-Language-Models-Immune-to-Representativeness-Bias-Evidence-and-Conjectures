Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given these conditions, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Then, we want to compute P(A | W1), the probability of A given witness 1's claim.

We can calculate P(W1|A) as the probability that witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height (80% or 0.8). Similarly, we can calculate P(W2|A') as the probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker's height (30% or 0.3), where A' represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A | W1) = [P(W1 | A) * P(A)] / [P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W2 | A') * P(A')]

We are given P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85. Using the given information, we can calculate P(W1 | A) = 0.8 and P(W2 | A') = 0.3.

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
= 0.12 / 0.375
= 0.32
