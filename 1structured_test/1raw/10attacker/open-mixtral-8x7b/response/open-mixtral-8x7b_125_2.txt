Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate P(A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A) = P(W1 | A) * P(A) + P(W2 | A) * P(not A)

where:
- W1 and W2 represent the statements of the two witnesses
- P(W1 | A) is the probability of Witness 1 being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(W2 | A) is the probability of Witness 2 being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (which is 15%)
- P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (which is 85%)

Using the given information, we can calculate:
- P(W1 | A) = 0.8 (Witness 1's accuracy)
- P(W2 | A) = 0.7 * 0.15 = 0.105 (Witness 2's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.105 * 0.85 ≈ 0.189 + 0.089 ≈ 0.278

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.278 or 27.8%.
