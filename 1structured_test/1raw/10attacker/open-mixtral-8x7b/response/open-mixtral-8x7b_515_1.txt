Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know that she is correct 80% of the time, so the probability is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to the given data.

Now, to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, we need to multiply the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8) with the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller (0.15).

probability = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
