Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height. The first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time. The second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time. 

We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. 

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that both witnesses would make such a claim, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's assume that the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height are independent events. Then, we can calculate the combined probability of both witnesses' claims by multiplying their individual probabilities:

P(both claims) = P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses made this claim. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both claims) = P(both claims | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(both claims)

From the information given, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population).

We've already calculated P(both claims) = 0.56.

To find P(both claims | attacker is 185 cm or taller), we need to consider the case where both witnesses are correct. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, this combined probability is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses made this claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both claims) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.56 â‰ˆ 0.15

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.15 or 15%.
