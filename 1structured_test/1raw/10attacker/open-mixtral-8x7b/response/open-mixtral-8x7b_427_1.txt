Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as Witness 1 claimed.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case would look something like:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B, which is what we want to find (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies).
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A, which is the accuracy of Witness 1 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A, which is the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of B, which is the total probability of both witnesses being correct.

Calculating P(B) is a bit more complex, since it involves the probabilities of both witnesses being correct simultaneously. We can calculate it as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B|not A), the accuracy of Witness 1 when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Without this information, we can't calculate P(B) and therefore can't use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B).

Therefore, we cannot provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information.
