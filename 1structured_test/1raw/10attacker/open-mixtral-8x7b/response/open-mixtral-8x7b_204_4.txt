Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so. We can use Bayes' theorem for this. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We are given P(W1|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy in identifying someone as 185 cm or taller), P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller), and we need to find P(W1), which we can calculate as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)

Here, ¬A represents the complementary event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

We are given P(W1|A) = 0.8 and need to find P(W1|¬A), which is the second witness's accuracy in identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm: P(W1|¬A) = 1 - P(¬W1|¬A) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 (since the second witness errs 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.7 * 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.595
      = 0.715

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
       ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.715
       ≈ 0.1613

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1613}
