Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given the first witness's accuracy, there's an 80% chance that the first witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, we also need to consider the second witness's statement.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a higher probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate the likelihood of the second witness being correct, given their 70% accuracy rate.

To find the probability of both witnesses being correct, we need to multiply their individual probabilities:

P(both correct) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd correct | 1st correct)

We want to find P(attacker is 185 cm or taller), so we'll calculate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both witnesses) = P(both correct) / P(both correct or 1st correct)

= (0.8 * 0.7) / ((0.8 * 0.7) + (0.2 * 0.85))

After calculating, we get:

{probability: 0.512, "This is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed."}
