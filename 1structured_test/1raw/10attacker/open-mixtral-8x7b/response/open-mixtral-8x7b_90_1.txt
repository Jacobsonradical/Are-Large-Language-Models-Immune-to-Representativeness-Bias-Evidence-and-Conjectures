Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller, based on their 80% accuracy rate. This means that if they say a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they are correct. So the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is 0.8.

However, this doesn't take into account the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it seems more likely that the second witness is correct.

To reconcile both pieces of information, we can calculate a conditional probability. The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's actual height is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (as calculated above). The probability that the second witness would claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's actual height is 185 cm or taller, is 0.3 (since the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when judging a person's height).

The overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' claims, is therefore:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) * P(first witness's claim) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness's claim) * P(second witness's claim)

We know P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = 0.8, and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness's claim) = 0 (since we're assuming the second witness is correct that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We also know that P(first witness's claim) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(second witness's claim) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Therefore, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0 * 0.85) = 0.12.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12.
