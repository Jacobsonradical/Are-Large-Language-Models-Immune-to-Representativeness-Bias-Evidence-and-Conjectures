Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens 80% of the time when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

So, the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

P(correct | 185+) = 0.8

The probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:

P(correct | <185) = 0.2

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the overall probability that the first witness is correct. Let's call the height of the attacker H:

P(correct) = P(H < 185) * P(correct | <185) + P(H ≥ 185) * P(correct | 185+)

We are given that P(H < 185) = 0.85 and P(H ≥ 185) = 0.15. So,

P(correct) = 0.85 * 0.2 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Now, we want to know the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H ≥ 185 | first witness) = P(first witness | H ≥ 185) * P(H ≥ 185) / P(first witness)

We have already calculated P(H ≥ 185) = 0.15 and P(first witness) = P(correct) = 0.29. We still need to calculate P(first witness | H ≥ 185):

P(first witness | H ≥ 185) = P(correct | 185+) = 0.8

So, finally, we get:

P(H ≥ 185 | first witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.321 / 0.29 ≈ 1.10345

However, this is not a valid probability, as it is greater than 1. This indicates that the given information is inconsistent and cannot be used to reliably estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
