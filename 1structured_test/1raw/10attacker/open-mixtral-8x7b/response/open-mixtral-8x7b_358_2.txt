Let's reason through this:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Given that the error rate for the first witness is 20%, this means that when they think someone is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the person really is that tall and a 20% chance that they made an error.

So, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

Probability = (Number of times the first witness is correct) / (Total number of times the first witness thinks the person is 185 cm or taller)

Let's assume the total number of times the first witness thinks the person is 185 cm or taller is 100 (to simplify the calculation). Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, this means that the number of times they are correct is 80.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

probability: 80 / 100 = 0.8

So, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
