Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.15 (15%) and incorrect with a probability of 0.85 (85%).
3. If the first witness is incorrect, that means the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with a probability of 0.80 (80%) and incorrect with a probability of 0.20 (20%).
5. If the second witness is correct and the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm, then the first witness's claim is incorrect.
6. So, we want to find the probability that the first witness is correct, given that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is also 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
- The first witness is correct (event A), which has a probability of P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.15)*(0.15) = 0.0225 (2.25%).
- The first witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (event ~A), which has a probability of P(B|~A) * P(~A) = (0.20)*(0.85) = 0.1700 (17%).

So, P(B) = 0.0225 + 0.1700 = 0.1925 (19.25%).

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.15)*(0.15) / 0.1925 â‰ˆ 0.1193 (11.93%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 11.93%.
