Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when claiming a person is 185 cm or taller, and when the person actually is 185 cm or taller: P(Correct and Tall) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect when claiming a person is 185 cm or taller, but the person actually is not: P(Incorrect and Short) = 0.2

Now, let's denote P(Tall) as the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller. We know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, so P(Tall) = 0.15.

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so P(Short) = 0.85.

We are interested in calculating P(Tall|Claim Tall) = P(Claim Tall and Tall) / P(Claim Tall)

P(Claim Tall and Tall) = P(Correct and Tall) * P(Tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(Claim Tall) = P(Correct and Tall) * P(Tall) + P(Incorrect and Short) * P(Short)

P(Claim Tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
