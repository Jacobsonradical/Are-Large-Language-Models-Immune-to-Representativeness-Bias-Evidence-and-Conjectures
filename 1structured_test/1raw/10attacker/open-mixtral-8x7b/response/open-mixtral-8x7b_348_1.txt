Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we need to consider the scenario where the first witness is correct and the second one is not.

Given the first witness's accuracy (80% chance of being correct), and the fact that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability estimate of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's important to note that our estimate is based solely on the first witness's claim without considering the second witness's statement or population statistics at this point. We will refine our estimate in the next step by incorporating all the given information.

Now, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses making mistakes. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time, the probability of them both making a mistake is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%.

Finally, to find the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, we'll use the formula:

P(A) = P(A and B') + P(A and B)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B is the event that the first witness is correct, and B' is the event that the first witness is incorrect.

P(A and B) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are correct, which is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%.

P(A and B') is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are incorrect, which is 0.06 (6%).

Now we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(A and B') + P(A and B) = 0.06 + 0.56 = 0.62 or 62%.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 62%.
