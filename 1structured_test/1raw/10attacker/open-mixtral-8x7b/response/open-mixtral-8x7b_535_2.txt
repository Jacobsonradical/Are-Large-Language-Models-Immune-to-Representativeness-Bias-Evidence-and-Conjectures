Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of the two witnesses.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
3. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim.

Given that these are two independent events, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct. The first witness being correct has a probability of 0.8, and the second witness being correct has a probability of 0.3 (since 100% - 70% = 30% of the time the second witness will say the person is shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller).

We want the probability that the first statement is true (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the second statement is false (attacker is not shorter than 1
