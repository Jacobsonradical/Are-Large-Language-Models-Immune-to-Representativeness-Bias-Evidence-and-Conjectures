Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' claims are conflicting, we cannot use the information from the second witness.
3. Instead, we can use the base rate from the city's population distribution.
4. The base rate is that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
5. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
6. However, there is no information available about the conditions during the witness's assessment of the attacker's height.
7. Therefore, to be conservative, we can assume the witness is only as good as their base rate.
8. This means the witness's correctness is equivalent to the base rate of 15%, making it unnecessary to apply Bayes' theorem.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
