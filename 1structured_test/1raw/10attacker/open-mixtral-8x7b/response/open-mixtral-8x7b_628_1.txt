To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This law states that the probability of an event can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of that event given each of several other events, multiplied by the probability of those other events.

In this case, the event we are interested in is the attacker being 185 cm or taller. The other events are the two possible outcomes for the first witness (identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, or identifying the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm).

We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as being 185 cm or taller, and that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifying them as such is:

0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

We also know that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, and that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the first witness incorrectly identifying them as being 185 cm or taller is:

0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

To find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can add these two probabilities together:

0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%

However, we also need to consider the information provided by the second witness. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness's claim. In order to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims, we need to calculate the probability of the second witness being correct.

We know that the second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone as being shorter than 185 cm, and that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm and the second witness correctly identifying them as such is:

0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595, or 59.5%

We also know that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as being shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time, and that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the second witness incorrectly identifying them as being shorter than 185 cm is:

0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045, or 4.5%

To find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims, we can add the probability of the first scenario (both witnesses being correct) to the probability of the second scenario (the first witness being incorrect and the second witness being correct):

0.29 + 0.045 = 0.335, or 33.5%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 29% based on the first witness's testimony alone, and 33.5% based on the testimony of both witnesses.
