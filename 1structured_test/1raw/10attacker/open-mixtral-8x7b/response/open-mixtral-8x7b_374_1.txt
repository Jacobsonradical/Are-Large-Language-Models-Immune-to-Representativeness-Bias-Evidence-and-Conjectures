Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height:
   - Witness 1: Correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
   - Witness 2: Correct 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.

Since we have conflicting statements from the two witnesses, we cannot directly use their individual accuracy to determine the probability. Instead, we need to calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct simultaneously.

The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller AND both witnesses correctly identify this is:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
where A is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "both witnesses correctly identify the attacker's height."

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of population is 185 cm or taller). However, we need to find P(B|A), the probability of both witnesses correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct simultaneously as follows:
P(B|A) = P(W1 is correct) * P(W2 is correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Now, we can calculate the probability of both events A and B happening:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
= 0.15 * 0.56
= 0.084

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.084}
