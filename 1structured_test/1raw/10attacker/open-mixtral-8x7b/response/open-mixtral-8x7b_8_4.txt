Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.
2. However, we also have information from two witnesses. The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (as the first witness claimed), we can use Bayes' theorem.
5. Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
6. In this case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".
7. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
8. P(A) is the prior probability, which is 15% (0.15).
9. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% (0.8).
10. P(B) is the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is actually that tall or not.
11. To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
12. P(B and A) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
13. P(B and not A) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not actually that tall, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
14. So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
15. Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B): P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414.
