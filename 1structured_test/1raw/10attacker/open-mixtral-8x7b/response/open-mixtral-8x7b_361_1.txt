Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height:
- Witness 1: 80% correct, 20% error
- Witness 2: 70% correct, 30% error

b) We also know that the city's population has the following distribution of heights:
- 85% shorter than 185 cm
- 15% 185 cm or taller

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's claim.

To do this, we need to consider both the reliability of the witness and the base rate of people with that height in the city.

We can use Bayes' theorem to combine these probabilities:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.
- P(B|A) is the probability of Witness 1 being correct (80%).
- P(A) is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of Witness 1 making the claim (we need to calculate this).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
1) The attacker is 185 cm or taller, and Witness 1 correctly identifies this.
2) The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and Witness 1 mistakenly claims they are 185 cm or taller.

The combined probability of Witness 1 making this claim is:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
