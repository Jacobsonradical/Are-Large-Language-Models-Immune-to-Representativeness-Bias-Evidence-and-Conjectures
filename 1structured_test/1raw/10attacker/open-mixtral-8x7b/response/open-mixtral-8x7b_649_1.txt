Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two scenarios:
1. The first witness is correct.
2. The first witness is incorrect.

The probability of the first scenario is the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80%.

The probability of the second scenario is the probability that the first witness is wrong, which is 20%. In this case, the attacker's actual height is still unknown, but we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the city's population statistics. This is a Bayesian update problem.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is wrong) = P(First witness is wrong | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(First witness is wrong)

P(First witness is wrong | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the city's population statistics)
P(First witness is wrong) = 0.2 (from the first witness's error rate)

Plugging these values in, we get:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is wrong) = 0.2 * 0.15 / 0.2 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is correct) * P(First witness is correct) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is wrong) * P(First witness is wrong)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.67

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.67}
