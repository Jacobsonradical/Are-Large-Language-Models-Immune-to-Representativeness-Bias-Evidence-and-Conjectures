Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
3. Now let's consider the reliability of the witnesses. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, there's a 30% chance that they're wrong in this case.
5. We are now interested in the scenario where both statements can be true, i.e., when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness's accuracy in this scenario is 80%, so the probability that the first witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (prior probability) * 80% (witness reliability) = 0.12 or 12%.
6. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the second witness is wrong in this scenario, which has a probability of 30%.
7. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is the product of the two probabilities calculated above.

The answer is: {probability: 0.12 * 0.3 = 0.036 or 3.6%}
