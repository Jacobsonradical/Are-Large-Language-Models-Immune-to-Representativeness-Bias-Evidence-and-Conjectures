Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

The first witness's claim about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is supported by the second witness's statement that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We want to find the probability that both of these statements are true, given the error rates of the witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's assume the role of the first witness can be modeled as a binary classifier with a precision of 0.8 (when the witness says the person is 185 cm or taller, they are correct 80% of the time).

Let's assume the role of the second witness can also be modeled as a binary classifier with a precision of 0.7 (when the witness says the person is shorter than 185 cm, they are correct 70% of the time).

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

P(B|A) = 0.3 (the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)

P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in the population)

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.3 * 0.15 + 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.8975

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.3 * 0.15) / 0.8975 â‰ˆ 0.0507 or 5.07%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.0507}.
