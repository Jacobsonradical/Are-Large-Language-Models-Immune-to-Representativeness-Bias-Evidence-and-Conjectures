Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making height judgments.

To calculate this probability, we can use the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

To calculate P(A ∩ B), the probability of both events A and B happening, consider that the first witness is correct 80% of the time. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * 0.8, where P(A) is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

We know from point b that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B). This is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether it is true or not. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, and in this case, the height is actually 185 cm or taller, we have P(B) = P(A) * 0.8 + P(not A) * (1 - 0.8), where P(not A) is the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm.

From point b, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(not A) = 0.85, and P(B) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Substituting the values back into the conditional probability formula, we get:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = (P(A) * 0.8) / 0.32 = (0.15 * 0.8) / 0.32 = 0.375

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.375}
