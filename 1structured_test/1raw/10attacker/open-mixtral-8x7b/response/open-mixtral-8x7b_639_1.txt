Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the two witnesses.

We can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In our case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm."

We need to find:
- P(A): the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B|A): the probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, and witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
- P(B|not A): the probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time, and witness 2 is correct 70% of the time. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = 0.56 * 0.15 / [0.56 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.084 / [0.084 + 0.119]
P(A|B) = 0.084 / 0.203
P(A|B) = 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
