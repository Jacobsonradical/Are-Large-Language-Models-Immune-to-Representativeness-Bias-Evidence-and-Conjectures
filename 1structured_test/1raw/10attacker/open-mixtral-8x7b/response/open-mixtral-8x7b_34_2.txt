Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness can correctly identify a person of that height 80% of the time, and err 20% of the time.
3. This means that when the first witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that they are correct and a 20% chance that they are mistaken.
4. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and assuming the attacker is representative of the general population, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From the problem, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness is mistaken 20% of the time when identifying someone shorter than 185 cm)

We can now calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
= [0.80 * 0.15] / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
≈ 0.410256

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41 (or 41%).
