Given the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height, we can calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the probability that the second witness is correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

For the first witness, their probability of being correct is 80%, and of being incorrect is 20%. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct, given that the attacker is in fact 185 cm or taller, is:

P(W1=correct | H=185 or taller) = 0.80

For the second witness, their probability of being correct is 70%, and of being incorrect is 30%. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the second witness is correct, given that the attacker is in fact shorter than 185 cm, is:

P(W2=correct | H=shorter) = 0.70

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H=185 or taller | W1=185 or taller) = P(W1=185 or taller | H=185 or taller) \* P(H=185 or taller) / P(W1=185 or taller)

We don't have information about the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, so we can't calculate the exact value of the above equation. However, we can still calculate the likelihood ratio, which is the ratio of the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, to the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Likelihood ratio = P(W1=185 or taller | H=185 or taller) / P(W1=185 or taller | H=shorter)

We know that P(W1=185 or taller | H=185 or taller) = 0.80 and P(W1=185 or taller | H=shorter) = 0.20. Therefore, the likelihood ratio is:

Likelihood ratio = 0.80 / 0.20 = 4

This means that the evidence provided by the first witness is four times more likely if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, compared to if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Without knowing the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can't calculate the exact posterior probability. However, in the absence of any other information, we can assume that the prior probability is 50%, meaning that the attacker is equally likely to be 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm.

In that case, the posterior probability would be:

Posterior probability = Prior probability \* Likelihood ratio / (Prior probability \* Likelihood ratio + (1 - Prior probability))

Posterior probability = 0.50 \* 4 / (0.50 \* 4 + 0.50) = 0.80

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.80}
