To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will consider the two scenarios: the first witness is correct and the first witness is not correct. We will then weight these scenarios based on the probability that the first witness is correct.

First, let's define some probabilities:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(A') = Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|A) = Probability that the first witness is correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(W1|A') = Probability that the first witness is correct when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided, we know:
P(A) + P(A') = 1
P(W1|A) = 0.8
P(W1|A') = 0.3
P(A') = 0.85 (from part b)

Now, using the law of total probability:
P(A) = P(A and W1) + P(A and W1')
P(A) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A')

Now we can solve for P(A):
P(A) - P(W1|A) * P(A) = P(W1|A') * P(A')
P(A) * (1 - P(W1|A)) = P(W1|A') * P(A')
P(A) = P(W1|A') * P(A') / (1 - P(W1|A))

Plug in the known probabilities:
P(A) = 0.3 * 0.85 / (1 - 0.8) â‰ˆ 0.315

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.315}
