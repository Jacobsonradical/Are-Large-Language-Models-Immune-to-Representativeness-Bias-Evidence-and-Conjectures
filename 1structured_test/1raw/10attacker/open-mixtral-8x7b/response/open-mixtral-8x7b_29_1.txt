Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(A).

According to witness 1, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this statement as W1.

We are given that witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the conditions are similar to those on the night of the attack. So, P(W1|A) = 0.8, where P(W1|A) represents the probability that witness 1 makes a correct statement about the attacker's height, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

We also need to consider the possibility that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, and let's denote this as ~A. In this case, witness 1 would be incorrect, and we know that witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when conditions are similar to those on the night of the attack. So, P(W1|~A) = 0.2, where P(W1|~A) represents the probability that witness 1 makes an incorrect statement about the attacker's height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(~A)]

From the problem statement, we know that P(~A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = [0.8 * P(A)] / [0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85]

To find P(A), we need to consider the prior information that we have about the attacker's height. Since we have no other information, we can assume that the attacker's height is equally likely to be above or below 185 cm, so we can start with P(A) = 0.5.

Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

P(A|W1) = [0.8 * 0.5] / [0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this value, we get:

P(A|W1) = 0.684

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.684}
