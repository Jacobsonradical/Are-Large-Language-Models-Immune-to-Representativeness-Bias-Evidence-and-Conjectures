To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that a witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We have two witnesses, so we'll consider their claims independently, and we'll use P(B|A) to represent the probability that a witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. Similarly, we'll use P(B|¬A) to represent the probability that a witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Witness 1:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (80% of the time, witness 1 correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (20% of the time, witness 1 incorrectly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 2:
P(B|A) = 0.7 (70% of the time, witness 2 correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.3 (30% of the time, witness 2 incorrectly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witnesses' claims are independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each witness separately and then multiply them together.

First, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller:

P(B and B|A) = P(B|A) * P(B|A) = (0.8)^2 ≈ 0.64

Next, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(B and B|¬A) = P(B|¬A) * P(B|¬A) ≈ (0.2 * 0.3) ≈ 0.06

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|B and B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses claimed so, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B and B) = P(B and B|A) * P(A) / (P(B and B|A) * P(A) + P(B and B|¬A) * P(¬A))

To calculate this, we need to find P(¬A), which is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since P(A) = 0.15, we have P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now, we have all the values required to calculate P(A|B and B):

P(A|B and B) ≈ (0.64 * 0.15) / ((0.64 * 0.15) + (0.06 * 0.85)) ≈ 0.7935

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7935}
