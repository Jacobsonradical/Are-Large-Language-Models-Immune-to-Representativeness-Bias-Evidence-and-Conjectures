Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Given that both witnesses contradict each other, we cannot determine with certainty if the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct, given their past accuracy.

The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which has a 80% chance of being correct. Thus, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
