To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:

- E as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- A as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(E|A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

We can compute P(E|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(E|A) = P(A|E) \* P(E) / P(A)

First, let's compute P(A|E), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the first witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

Next, let's compute P(E), the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Finally, we need to compute P(A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:

- P(A and E), the probability that the witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller
- P(A and not E), the probability that the witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller but the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm

We can calculate P(A and E) as the product of P(E) and the first witness's accuracy: 15% \* 80% = 12%

We can calculate P(A and not E) as the product of P(not E) and the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller: 85% \* 20% = 17%

Thus, P(A) = P(A and E) + P(A and not E) = 12% + 17% = 29%

Now, we have all the values required to compute P(E|A):

P(E|A) = P(A|E) \* P(E) / P(A) = 80% \* 15% / 29% â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
