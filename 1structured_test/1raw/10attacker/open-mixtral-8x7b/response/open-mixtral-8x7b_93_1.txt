Let's reason through this:

1. We want to know the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the circumstances. This is a conditional probability and can be written as P(A|B), where A is the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B represents the total available information.

2. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

3. From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

4. To calculate P(B|A), we need to consider both witnesses agreeing. Since the first witness is always correct when they say someone is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness agrees with them 70% of the time, we have P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.

5. Calculating P(B) requires us to consider all possibilities for the attacker's height. If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, then both witnesses will agree on this 0.56 of the time. If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, then they'll disagree 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 of the time (because the first witness will be wrong 20% of the time when estimating someone as shorter than 185 cm). So, P(B) = 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.8.

6. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives us P(A|B) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.095.

Answer: {probability: 0.095}
