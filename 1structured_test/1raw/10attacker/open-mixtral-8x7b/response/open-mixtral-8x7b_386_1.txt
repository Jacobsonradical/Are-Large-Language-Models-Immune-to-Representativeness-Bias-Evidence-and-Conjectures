Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

2. However, we have testimonies from two witnesses. The first one, who we'll call W1, claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Given similar conditions, W1 is correct 80% of the time.

3. The second witness, W2, claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. W2 is correct 70% of the time.

4. Given that W1 thinks the attacker was 185 cm or taller and W2 thinks the opposite, we can calculate the probability of both events happening.

5. The probability of W1 being correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of W2 being incorrect is 0.3 (30%). The probability of both these events happening is the product of their individual probabilities, or 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24, assuming both witnesses are giving their testimonies independently.

Answer: {probability: 0.24}
