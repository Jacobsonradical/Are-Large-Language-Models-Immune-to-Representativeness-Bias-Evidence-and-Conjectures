Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses would make a mistake, and then subtract that from 1 to get the probability that at least one of them is correct.

First, let's find the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims a person is 185 cm or taller: 20% or 0.2.
Second, let's find the probability that the second witness incorrectly claims a person is shorter than 185 cm: 30% or 0.3.

Now, we need to find the probability that both witnesses make a mistake. Since these are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities:

0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%

Finally, we subtract this probability from 1 to get the probability that at least one of the witnesses is correct:

1 - 0.06 = 0.94 or 94%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.94}
