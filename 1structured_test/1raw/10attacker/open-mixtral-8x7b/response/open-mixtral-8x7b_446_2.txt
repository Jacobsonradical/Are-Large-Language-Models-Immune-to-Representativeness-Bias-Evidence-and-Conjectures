Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who thought the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who thought the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.
4. To combine their evidence, we can calculate the probability that they both agree the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 2 is correct.
5. The probability that Witness 2 is correct and also agrees with Witness 1 is 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56.

However, this calculation does not fully address the population distribution given in part (b). To account for this, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our initial estimate:

1. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence from the witnesses.
2. We want P(A|E), the probability of A given E.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
4. P(E|A) is the probability of the witnesses agreeing, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(E|A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
5. P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from part (b)).
6. P(E) is the total probability of the evidence, which is the sum of the probabilities of the witnesses agreeing for both height categories: P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)
7. P(E|not A) is the probability of the witnesses agreeing, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(E|not A) = 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255
8. P(not A) is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from part (b)).
9. Therefore, P(E) = 0.12 * 0.15 + 0.255 * 0.85 = 0.23075
10. Finally, P(A|E) = 0.12 * 0.15 / 0.23075 = 0.0823 or 8.23%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 8.23%.
