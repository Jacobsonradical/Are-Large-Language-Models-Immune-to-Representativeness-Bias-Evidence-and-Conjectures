Let's break down the information given and reason through it.

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making such a claim.
4. However, we don't know if either witness is correct in this specific case.
5. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both witnesses' reliability.

Let's calculate the probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness 1 is correct) = 0.8
P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = 1 (since this is what Witness 1 claimed)

So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
