Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of 0.8 (80% accuracy for Witness 1). We need to find the probability of Witness 1 being correct, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time for people 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of whether they are or not, which is calculated as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1 and A) + P(W1 and not A)
P(W1) = P(A) * P(W1|A) + P(not A) * P(W1|not A)

Given that P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85 (100% - 15%), and considering Witness 1's accuracy for both cases (80% and 40% respectively):

P(W1) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.4) = 0.12 + 0.34 = 0.46

Now, we can find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's statement:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.46 â‰ˆ 0.2174

{probability: 0.2174}
