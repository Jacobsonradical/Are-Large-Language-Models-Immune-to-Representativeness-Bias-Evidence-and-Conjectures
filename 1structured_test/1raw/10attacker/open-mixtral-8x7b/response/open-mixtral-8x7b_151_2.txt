Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

P(1st witness correct) = 80% = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 70% = 0.7

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, assuming their claims are independent events:

P(both correct) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Next, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being incorrect, assuming their claims are independent events:

P(both incorrect) = P(1st incorrect) * P(2nd incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

In order to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the case where both witnesses are correct. We're interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and that both witnesses are correct given that condition:

P(attacker 185 cm | both correct) = P(both correct | attacker 185 cm) * P(attacker 185 cm)

From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the combined probability that both witnesses are correct is 0.56 as calculated earlier. So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

P(attacker 185 cm | both correct) = P(both correct | attacker 185 cm) * P(attacker 185 cm)
= 0.56 * 0.15
= 0.084

So, {probability: 0.084}
