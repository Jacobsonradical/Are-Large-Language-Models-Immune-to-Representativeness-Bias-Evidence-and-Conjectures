Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker's actual height in 15% of the population. However, we also need to account for the fact that this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts witness 1's claim. We know that this witness is correct 70% of the time when making such a claim.

Given these pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, based on witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
