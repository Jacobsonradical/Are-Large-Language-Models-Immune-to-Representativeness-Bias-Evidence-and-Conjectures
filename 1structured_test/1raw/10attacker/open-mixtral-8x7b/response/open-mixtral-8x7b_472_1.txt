Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens only 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which would be correct 85% of the time naturally.
5. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 30% of the time.
6. Given that both witnesses agree on the attacker's height, the probability that they are both correct is the product of their individual accuracies, i.e., 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%.
7. However, we're interested in the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so and considering both witnesses' reliabilities.
8. This is a case of dependent events, and we can use the formula for total probability: P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)
9. Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B1 is the event that the first witness is correct, and B2 is the event that the first witness is incorrect.
10. Substituting the values, we get: P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) + (1 - 0.3) * (1 - 0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12 + 0.054 = 0.174 or 17.4%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 17.4%.
