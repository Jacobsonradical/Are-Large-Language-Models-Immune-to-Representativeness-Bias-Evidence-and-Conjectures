Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement. To calculate this, we need to consider the accuracy of the first witness. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and we know the witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim. Therefore, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

probability: 0.8
