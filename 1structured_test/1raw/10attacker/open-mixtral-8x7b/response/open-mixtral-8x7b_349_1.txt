Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this probability as:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
= 15% (given in the problem statement)

Next, we calculate the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B|A) = Probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
= 80% (the witness's ability to judge a person's height, as given in the problem statement)

Then, we calculate the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as:

P(B|B') = Probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
= 20% (the witness's error rate when the true height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|B') * P(B')]

We already know the values of P(B|A), P(A), P(B|B'), we need to find the value of P(B'), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B') = P(B' and A) + P(B' and A')
= P(B'|A') * P(A')
= 30% * 85%
= 25.5%

Now, we can calculate the final probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|B') * P(B')]
= 80% * 15% / [80% * 15% + 20% * 25.5%]
= 0.48 or 48%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.48, or 48%}.
