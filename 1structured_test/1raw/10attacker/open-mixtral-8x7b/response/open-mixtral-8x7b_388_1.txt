Let's reason through this problem:

There are two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim.

1. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
2. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the probability we're interested in is the probability that a randomly selected person is in this category, given that Witness 1 claims they are in this category.
3. To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the person is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that Witness 1 claims the person is 185 cm or taller.
4. We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1's accuracy when the person is actually 185 cm or taller) and P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion of people 185 cm or taller).
5. To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where Witness 1 is correct and where Witness 1 is incorrect. When Witness 1 is correct, P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. When Witness 1 is incorrect, P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Thus, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
6. Now we can calculate the probability we're interested in: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.
