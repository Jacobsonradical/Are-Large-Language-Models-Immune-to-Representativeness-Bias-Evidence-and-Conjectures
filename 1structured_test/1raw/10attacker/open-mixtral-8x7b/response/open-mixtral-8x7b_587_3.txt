Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the two witnesses.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which agrees with 80% of the first witness's judgments.
3. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which disagrees with 30% of the second witness's judgments.

Now let's calculate the probabilities based on the independent judgments of the two witnesses:

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness incorrect) = 0.3

We want to find P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | 1st witness correct and 2nd witness incorrect)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness incorrect | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(2nd witness incorrect) * P(1st witness correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the second term in the equation above, as it depends on the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

If we assume that the base rate is 15% (as provided in the question), then we can calculate the second term:

P(1st witness correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(1st witness incorrect | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.3 + 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.24 + 0.12 = 0.36

However, this calculation assumes that the witnesses' testimonies are conditionally independent, which may not be the case. Thus, the actual probability could be different.

Based on the given information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.36}
