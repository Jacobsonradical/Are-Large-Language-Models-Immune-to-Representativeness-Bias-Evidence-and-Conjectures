Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height accurately.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. In the general population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's testimony, we need to consider the accuracy of Witness 1. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's testimony, is the probability that Witness 1 is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's testimony) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Population is 15%)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12 (or 12%)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
