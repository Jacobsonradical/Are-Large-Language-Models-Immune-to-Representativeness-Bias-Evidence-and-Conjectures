To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following reasoning:

1. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of A given W1.
2. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
3. P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8
4. P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the second piece of information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15
5. To find P(W1), we need to consider all possible scenarios where W1 can occur. This includes both cases when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (A) and when the attacker is not (A'). Using the law of total probability, P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')
6. P(W1|A') is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time, P(W1|A') = 0.2
7. P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 85% (100% - 15% from P(A)). So, P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41
8. Now we can calculate P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.41) = 0.18 (rounded to two decimal points)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.18}.
