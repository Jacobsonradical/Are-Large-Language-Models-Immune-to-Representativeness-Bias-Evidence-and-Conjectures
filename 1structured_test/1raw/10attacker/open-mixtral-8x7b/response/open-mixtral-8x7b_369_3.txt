Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that only 15% of the population is 185cm or taller.
3. Therefore, if we randomly select a person, there's a high chance (85%) that the second witness would be correct in identifying them as shorter than 185cm, but a low chance (15%) that the first witness would be correct in identifying them as 185cm or taller.
4. However, in this case, both witnesses agreed that the attacker was 185cm or taller. This alignment of testimonies suggests that the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is higher than the base rate of 15%.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem. The exact calculation is a bit complex and requires making some assumptions, such as the independence of the witnesses' errors. But roughly, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies would be:

P(tall | witnesses) = P(witnesses | tall) * P(tall) / P(witnesses)

where:
- P(tall) is the base rate of people being 185cm or taller, which is 15%.
- P(witnesses | tall) is the probability of the witnesses making their statements given that the attacker is 185cm or taller. This is 0.8 (the accuracy of the first witness) * 0.7 (the accuracy of the second witness) = 0.56.
- P(witnesses) is the overall probability of the witnesses making their statements, which requires considering all possible combinations of correct and incorrect identifications. This is a more complex calculation that I won't go into here, but it's essentially a weighted average of the probabilities of the witnesses being correct or incorrect, given the base rates.

Given these calculations, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, would be higher than 15%, but likely not as high as 80% (the accuracy of the first witness). A precise calculation would require knowing more information about the relationship between the witnesses' errors, which is not provided.

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: between 0.15 and 0.8, but closer to 0.56, given the information provided}
