Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, given their individual error rates.

P(both correct) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(first witness correct) * P(second witness correct) + P(shorter than 185 cm) * P(first witness error) * P(second witness error)

We know P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

We also know that P(first witness correct) = 0.8, P(first witness error) = 0.2, P(second witness correct) = 0.7, and P(second witness error) = 0.3.

Now we can calculate P(both correct):

P(both correct) = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3)
P(both correct) = 0.084 + 0.0405
P(both correct) = 0.1245

Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(185 cm or taller | first witness claim) = P(both correct) / P(first witness claim)

We know P(both correct) = 0.1245, and the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, P(first witness claim) = 0.8.

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(185 cm or taller | first witness claim) = 0.1245 / 0.8
P(185 cm or taller | first witness claim) = 0.155625

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1556, or 15.56%.
