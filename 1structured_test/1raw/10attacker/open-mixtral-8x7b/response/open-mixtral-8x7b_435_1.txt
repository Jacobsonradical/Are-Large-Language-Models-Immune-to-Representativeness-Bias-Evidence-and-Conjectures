Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. There are two witnesses with different opinions about the attacker's height.
3. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability, which requires us to determine the prior probability, likelihood for each witness, and the combined likelihood.

Let's first calculate the prior probability:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm is 15%.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood for each witness.
- Witness 1: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the probability that they incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
- Witness 2: The probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm is 0.7, and the probability that they incorrectly identify a person as shorter than 185 cm is 0.3.

Now we can calculate the combined likelihood for the two witnesses when the attacker is taller than 185 cm:
- The probability that both witnesses identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
- The probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, and the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

So the combined likelihood for the two witnesses when the attacker is taller than 185 cm is 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.80.

Now we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is taller than 185 cm | both witnesses claim so) = (Likelihood * Prior Probability) / (Likelihood * Prior Probability + Other Likelihood * Other Prior Probability)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.413793103 (approximately)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
