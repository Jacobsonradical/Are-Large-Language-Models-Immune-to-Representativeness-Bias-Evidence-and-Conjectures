Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller". We want to find P(A|B).

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population), and we know P(B|A) from the first witness's accuracy: 0.8 (80%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: either both witnesses are correct or only witness 1 is correct. The probability of both being correct is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56, and the probability of only witness 1 being correct is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24. So, P(B) = 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.15.
