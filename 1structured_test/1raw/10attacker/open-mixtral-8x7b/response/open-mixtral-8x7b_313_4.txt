Let's analyze the information provided and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement.

We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.

Now, we need to find the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the witness's accuracy in such cases, which is 80%.

So, our final estimate is:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12}

Therefore, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
