Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 1 - P(shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the joint probability that both witnesses are correct when they claim the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(1st witness correct and attacker taller than or equal to 185 cm) = P(1st witness correct) * P(attacker taller than or equal to 185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim, we can divide the above joint probability by the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.

P(attacker taller than or equal to 185 cm | 1st witness claims taller than or equal to 185 cm) = P(1st witness correct and attacker taller than or equal to 185 cm) / P(1st witness claims taller than or equal to 185 cm)

We need to calculate the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm, considering their error rates:

P(1st witness claims taller than or equal to 185 cm) = P(1st witness correct) + P(1st witness incorrect and 2nd witness correct) * P(attacker taller than or equal to 185 cm)
                                                     = 0.8 + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.7) * 0.15
                                                     = 0.8 + 0.0675
                                                     = 0.8675

Finally, we can calculate the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.8675, rounded to 3 decimal places}
{probability: 0.1385, rounded to 4 decimal places}
