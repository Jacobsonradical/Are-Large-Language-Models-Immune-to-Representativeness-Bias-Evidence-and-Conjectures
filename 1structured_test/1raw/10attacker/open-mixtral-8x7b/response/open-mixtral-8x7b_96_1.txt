Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(W1Correct) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect) = 0.2

P(W2Correct) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect) = 0.3

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(Tall) = 15% = 0.15
P(Short) = 85% = 0.85

Now let's find the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1Correct ∧ W2Correct | Tall) = P(W1Correct | Tall) * P(W2Correct | Tall)
= (0.8) * (0.7)
= 0.56

Similarly, let's find the probability of both witnesses being incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1Incorrect ∧ W2Incorrect | Tall) = P(W1Incorrect | Tall) * P(W2Incorrect | Tall)
= (0.2) * (0.3)
= 0.06

To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim, we need to calculate the following probability:

P(Tall | W1Correct) = P(W1Correct ∧ W2Correct | Tall) + P(W1Incorrect ∧ W2Incorrect | Tall)
= 0.56 + 0.06
= 0.62

Therefore, based on the first witness's claim, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.62}
