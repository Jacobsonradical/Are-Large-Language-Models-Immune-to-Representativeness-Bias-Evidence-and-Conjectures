Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made this claim. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(Taller | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Taller) * P(Taller) / P(Witness 1)

We are given P(Witness 1 | Taller) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller).
We are given P(Taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(Witness 1), we can use the law of total probability:
P(Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Taller) * P(Taller) + P(Witness 1 | Shorter) * P(Shorter)

We need to find P(Witness 1 | Shorter), which is the probability that Witness 1 claims the person is 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is equal to 1 - P(Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time).

We are given P(Shorter) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(Witness 1):
P(Witness 1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8

Finally, we can calculate P(Taller | Witness 1):
P(Taller | Witness 1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
