Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, each with a certain accuracy in judging a person's height:
   - Witness 1: 80% correct, 20% error
   - Witness 2: 70% correct, 30% error

b. We also know the distribution of heights in the city's population:
   - 85% are shorter than 185 cm
   - 15% are 185 cm or taller

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot directly determine the attacker's height. However, we can estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim.

To do this, let's calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct given their individual accuracy:

P(W1_correct) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability of the second witness agreeing with witness 1, given that witness 1 is correct:

P(W2_agrees | W1_correct) = P(W2_correct) = 0.7

Next, we need to calculate the probability of both witnesses agreeing that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1_correct ∩ W2_agrees) = P(W1_correct) * P(W2_agrees | W1_correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness is incorrect. If the first witness is incorrect, then the second witness's claim becomes irrelevant. Since 20% of the time the first witness is incorrect, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is simply the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

So, to find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate a weighted average of these two probabilities:

P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = P(W1_correct ∩ W2_agrees) * P(W1_correct) + P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | W1_incorrect) * P(W1_incorrect)
                                 = 0.56 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2
                                 = 0.538

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.538}.
