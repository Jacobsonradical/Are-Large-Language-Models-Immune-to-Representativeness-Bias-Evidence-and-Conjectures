Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the height is actually 185 cm or taller) and P(!A) = 0.15 (population proportion that is 185 cm or taller).

However, to find the overall probability P(A), we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness erred when the height was actually shorter than 185 cm.

Let's denote P(B|!A) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm. We know P(B|!A) = 1 - P(B'|!A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (first witness's error rate when the height is actually shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|!A) * P(!A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255) = 0.12 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
