Let's break down the information given and reason through it.

1. The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses.

We'll calculate the probability of this event based on the two possibilities:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The attacker is shorter than 1
