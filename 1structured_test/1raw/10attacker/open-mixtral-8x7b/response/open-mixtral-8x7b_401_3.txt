Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct and then divide it by the probability of them agreeing on any height.

The probability of Witness 1 being correct and identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%) * 0.8 (80%) = 0.12 or 12%.

The probability of Witness 2 being correct and identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (85%) * 0.7 (70%) = 0.595 or 59.5%.

The probability of them agreeing on any height is the sum of the above probabilities: 0.12 + 0.595 = 0.715 or 71.5%.

Now, we can calculate the probability of them being correct and agreeing on the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller:

Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Both witnesses agree) = Probability(Both witnesses agree & Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / Probability(Both witnesses agree)

= (0.12) / (0.715)

= 0.1677 or approximately 16.77%

Since probabilities should be between 0 and 1, we'll provide the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.1677}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 16.77%.
