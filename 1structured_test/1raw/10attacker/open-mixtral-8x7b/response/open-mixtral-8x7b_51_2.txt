To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both witnesses and the population statistics to calculate the probability that two witnesses with the given error rates would both claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker actually was that tall, as well as the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was not that tall. 

The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 80%, and the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm is 70%. The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is therefore 30%.

Let's assume that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. In that case, the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24, since the first witness is correct and the second witness errs.

On the other hand, let's assume that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. In that case, the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14, since the first witness errs and the second witness is correct.

The population statistics tell us that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(both witnesses claim attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(both witnesses claim attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / (0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.036 / 0.155

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.232 or 23.2%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.232.
