Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since we know the accuracy of each witness, we can calculate the probability of each witness being correct or incorrect.
3. For the first witness, there is an 80% chance they are correct when saying someone is 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance they are incorrect.
4. For the second witness, there is a 70% chance they are correct when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm, and a 30% chance they are incorrect.
5. Given that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that both witnesses are correct.
6. The probability of both witnesses being correct is the product of their individual probabilities of being correct.
7. So, the probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of the second witness being incorrect is 0.3 (since they contradict the first witness).
8. Therefore, the probability of both witnesses being correct is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

However, this answer is not the final probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since there are more people in the city who are shorter than 185 cm, we must also consider the possibility that the second witness is correct and the first witness is incorrect.

9. Let's denote P as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
10. Then, the probability that the second witness is correct and the first is incorrect is 1 - P (since the two statements are mutually exclusive).
11. Using the same calculation as before, the probability of both witnesses being correct is now 0.8 * (1-P), and the probability of the second witness being correct is 0.7.
12. Setting these probabilities equal to each other and solving for P, we get:

0.8 \* (1-P) = 0.7P
1.5P = 0.8
P = 0.533 (rounded to three decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: {probability: 0.533}
