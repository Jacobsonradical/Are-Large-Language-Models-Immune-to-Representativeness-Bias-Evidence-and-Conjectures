Let's reason through this:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we don't have any information about how often these two witnesses would both be correct or both be incorrect at the same time.

Given the information provided, the most conservative estimate we can make is based solely on the height testimony of the more reliable witness (the one who is right 80% of the time). 

So, we estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be 0.8 (or 80%). This is because, even in the worst case where the second witness is always incorrect when the first one is correct, the first witness's testimony still gives us an 80% likelihood that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
