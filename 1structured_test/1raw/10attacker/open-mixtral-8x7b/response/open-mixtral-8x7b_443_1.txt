Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller in the city.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time when someone is 185 cm or taller.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but their statement is not consistent with the first witness's claim.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = P(first witness's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15.

To find P(first witness's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller), we need to consider that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. So, P(first witness's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

Therefore, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.12}
