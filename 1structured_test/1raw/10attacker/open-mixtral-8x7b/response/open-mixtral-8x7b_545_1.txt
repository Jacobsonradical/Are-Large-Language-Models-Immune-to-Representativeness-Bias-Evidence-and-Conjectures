Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.15 (if the attacker is randomly chosen from the population) or with a probability of 0.8 (the witness's claimed accuracy).
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with a probability of 0.85 (population accuracy) or with a probability of 0.7 (the witness's claimed accuracy).
4. Since both witnesses' claims cannot be correct at the same time, we need to consider the least likely scenario: that both witnesses are wrong. This would mean the first witness incorrectly identified a person as 185 cm or taller (a 20% chance), and the second witness correctly identified a person as shorter than 185 cm (a 70% chance).
5. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller is the higher of 0.15 (population accuracy) and the product of 0.8 (first witness's accuracy) and the probability that the second witness is wrong when they claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.3*0.3 = 0.09.

Hence, the answer is {probability: 0.27, which is the maximum of 0.15 and 0.8*0.9}.
