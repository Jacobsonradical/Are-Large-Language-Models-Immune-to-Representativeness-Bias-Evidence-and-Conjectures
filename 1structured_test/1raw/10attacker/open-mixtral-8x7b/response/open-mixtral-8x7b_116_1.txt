Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since these two statements cannot both be true, we can effectively disregard the second witness's statement for this particular estimation.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is the same as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
