To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will consider the two pieces of evidence from the witnesses as well as the population distribution.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(T).

From the information given, we can calculate the following probabilities:
- P(W1|T) = Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% accurate)
- P(W1|not T) = Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (20% accurate)
- P(W2|T) = Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller = 0.3 (30% accurate)
- P(W2|not T) = Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller = 0.7 (70% accurate)
- P(not T) = Probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller = 0.85 (85% of population)

Now we can calculate P(T) using the law of total probability:

P(T) = P(W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T)

We can calculate each term separately using conditional probabilities:

1. P(W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) = P(W1|T) * P(W2|T) * P(T) = 0.8 * 0.3 * P(T)
2. P(W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) = P(W1|T) * P(not W2|T) * P(T) = 0.8 * 0.7 * P(T)
3. P(not W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) = P(not W1|T) * P(W2|T) * P(T) = 0.2 * 0.3 * P(T)
4. P(not W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) = P(not W1|T) * P(not W2|T) * P(T) = 0.2 * 0.7 * P(T)

Now we can sum up these terms and solve for P(T):

P(T) * (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.8 * 0.7 + 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.2 * 0.7) = P(W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T)

From the given data, we know that:

P(W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ W2 ∩ T) + P(not W1 ∩ not W2 ∩ T) = 1

So we can simplify this equation:

P(T) * (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.8 * 0.7 + 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.2 * 0.7) = 1

Now we can calculate P(T):

P(T) = 1 / (0.8 * 0.3 + 0.8 * 0.7 + 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.2 * 0.7) ≈ 0.4878

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4878.
