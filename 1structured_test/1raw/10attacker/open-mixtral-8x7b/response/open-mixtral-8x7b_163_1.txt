Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. So, when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time. So, when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance they're right.
4. However, since both witnesses' claims contradict each other, we can't treat their claims as independent events. We have to consider the possibility that one of them is wrong.
5. If Witness 2 is wrong (which happens 30% of the time), then their claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is incorrect, and the attacker must be 185 cm or taller.
6. Since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is 0.8.

So, {probability: 0.8}
