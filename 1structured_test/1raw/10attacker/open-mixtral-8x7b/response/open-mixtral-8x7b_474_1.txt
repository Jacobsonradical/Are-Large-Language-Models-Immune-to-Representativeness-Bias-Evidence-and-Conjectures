Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time, which implies that their error rate for identifying someone as shorter than 1
