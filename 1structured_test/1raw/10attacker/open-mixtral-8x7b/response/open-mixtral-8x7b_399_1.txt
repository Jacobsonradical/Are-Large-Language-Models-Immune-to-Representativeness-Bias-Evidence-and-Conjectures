To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B1 is the first witness's claim that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B2 is the second witness's claim that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From statement (a), we know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(A|B1) = 0.8. We also know that the second witness is correct 70% of the time, so P(not A|B2) = 0.7. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B2) = 0.85. Therefore, P(B1) = 1 - P(B2) = 0.15.

From statement (b), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting these values into the formula for total probability, we get:

0.15 = 0.8 * P(B1) + 0.3 * 0.85

Solving for P(B1), we get:

P(B1) = (0.15 - 0.3 * 0.85) / 0.8
= 0.0375 / 0.8
= 0.046875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.046875}
