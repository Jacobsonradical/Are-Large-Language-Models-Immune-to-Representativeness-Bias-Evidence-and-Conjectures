Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.

2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller. So, the likelihood of the first witness being correct is 0.8.

3. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The likelihood of this witness being correct is 0.7 (since this witness is correct 70% of the time).

4. Since these two pieces of information are contradictory, we'll use Bayes' theorem to combine them. The formula is:
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

5. Plugging in our values:
   P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.
   P(B|A) is the likelihood of the first witness being correct (0.8).
   P(A) is the prior probability (0.15).
   P(B|not A) is the likelihood of the second witness being correct (0.7).
   P(not A) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

6. Calculating the posterior probability:
   P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.595) = 0.1705

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1705 or 17.05%.
