Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. 

To calculate this, we can use the likelihood formula, which is:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the observed evidence from both witnesses.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 (witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so they are wrong 30% of the time)

Now, we need to find P(B), which is the overall probability of the observed evidence from both witnesses.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using the likelihood formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.2759

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2759 (27.59%).
