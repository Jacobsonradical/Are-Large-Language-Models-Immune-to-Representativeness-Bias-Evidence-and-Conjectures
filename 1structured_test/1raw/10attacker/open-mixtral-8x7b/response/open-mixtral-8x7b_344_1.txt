Let's first calculate the likelihoods of the first witness being correct and incorrect:

P(W1_correct) = 0.8 (the witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W1_incorrect) = 0.2 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)

Similarly, let's calculate the likelihoods of the second witness being correct and incorrect:

P(W2_correct) = 0.7 (the witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)
P(W2_incorrect) = 0.3 (the witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller:

P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(Short) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we need to calculate the combined probabilities of both statements being true and both statements being false.

P(W1_correct and W2_correct and Tall) = P(Tall) * P(W1_correct) * P(W2_correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.07
P(W1_incorrect and W2_incorrect and Short) = P(Short) * P(W1_incorrect) * P(W2_incorrect) = 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.051

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:

P(Tall | W1_correct) = P(W1_correct and W2_correct and Tall) / (P(W1_correct and W2_correct and Tall) + P(W1_incorrect and W2_incorrect and Short))
= 0.07 / (0.07 + 0.051)
= 0.07 / 0.121
= 0.578

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.578}.
