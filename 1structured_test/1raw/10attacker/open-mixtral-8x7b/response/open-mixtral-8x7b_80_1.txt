Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time when they make such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means they believe witness 1 is mistaken. However, witness 2 is only correct 70% of the time when they contradict a claim that the person is 185 cm or taller.

Given these facts, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, because witness 1's claim in favor of this height matches their accuracy rate of 80%, while witness 2's claim against this height only matches their accuracy rate of 70%.

However, to provide a numerical estimate, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' accounts. This involves using Bayes' theorem, which can be complex given the information available. 

Since we don't have exact numbers of people in the city or specific data about how often the witnesses agree or disagree, we cannot provide a precise numerical estimate. But based on the information provided, it seems more probable that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
