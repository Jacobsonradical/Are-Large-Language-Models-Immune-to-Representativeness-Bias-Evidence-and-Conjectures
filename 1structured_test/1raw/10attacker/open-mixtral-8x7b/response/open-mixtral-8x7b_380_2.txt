Let's break down the information given and reason through it:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time.
3. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm and errs 30% of the time.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We don't know the exact probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller in the city, but we can use the information provided about the population:
85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness 1 is correct) = 0.8 (since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)

So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, this doesn't take into account Witness 2's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we also need to calculate the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) given Witness 2's claim:

P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller | Witness 2's claim) = P(Witness 2 is correct) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

P(Witness 2 is correct) = 0.7 (since Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm)

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.85

So, P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller | Witness 2's claim) = 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595

Given that the probabilities must add up to 1, we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as Witness 1 claimed:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) * P(Witness 1's claim) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2's claim) * P(Witness 2's claim)

Since Witness 1 claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, P(Witness 1's claim) = 1 - P(Witness 2's claim). However, since we don't have information about P(Witness 2's claim), we cannot calculate an exact probability.

However, if we assume that both witnesses have equal chances of being correct (which is not necessarily the case), then P(Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 2's claim) = 0.5. In this case:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 * 0.5 + 0.595 * 0.5 = 0.3575

So, in this scenario, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as Witness 1 claimed is around 0.3575 (35.75%).
