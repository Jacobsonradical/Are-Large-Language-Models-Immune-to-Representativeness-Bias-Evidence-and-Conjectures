Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, when they claim someone is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.
3. The second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time. So, when the first witness claims someone is 185 cm or taller and the second witness disagrees, the first witness is right 80% of the time.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.8.
