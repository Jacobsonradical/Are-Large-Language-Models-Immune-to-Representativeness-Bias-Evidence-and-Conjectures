Let's break down the problem and reason through it:

1. We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate when correct and a 20% error rate when wrong.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate when correct and a 30% error rate when wrong.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability that both witnesses are correct or that only Witness 1 is correct.

First, let's find the probability that both witnesses are correct:
P(Both correct) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Next, let's find the probability that only Witness 1 is correct:
P(Only W1 correct) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 wrong)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

Now, to find the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we add these two probabilities together:
P(Attacker 185 cm or taller) = P(Both correct) + P(Only W1 correct)
= 0.56 + 0.24
= 0.80

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.8}
