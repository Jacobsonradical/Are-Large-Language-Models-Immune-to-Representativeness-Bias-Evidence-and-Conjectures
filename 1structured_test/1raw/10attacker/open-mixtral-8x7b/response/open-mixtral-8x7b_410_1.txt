Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony doesn't help us in this case.
3. The first witness claims the correct height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller.
4. However, we also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, which means that there's an 85% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
5. To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and that the first witness correctly identified the height, we need to multiply the two probabilities together: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.12}.
