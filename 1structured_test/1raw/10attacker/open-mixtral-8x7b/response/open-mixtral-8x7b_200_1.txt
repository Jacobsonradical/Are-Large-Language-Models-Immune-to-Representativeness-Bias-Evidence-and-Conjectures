To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will consider the claims of both witnesses and the base rates of heights in the city.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1 represent the event that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height.
W2 represent the event that the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height.
B represent the event that the base rate of people with height 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A) given the information about the witnesses and base rates. We can calculate it as follows:

P(A) = P(A ∩ W1) + P(A ∩ W1')

We need to find the probabilities for each term separately:

P(A ∩ W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) (by Bayes theorem)
P(A) = 15% (given in the problem)
P(W1|A) = 80% (first witness's accuracy when the true height is 185 cm or taller)

So, P(A ∩ W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, let's find P(A ∩ W1'):
P(W1'|A) = 1 - P(W1|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (probability of the first witness making an error)

To find P(A ∩ W1'), we also need the probability of the second witness being correct when the true height is 185 cm or taller, which is 70%. Let's denote this probability as P(W2|A):

P(A ∩ W1') = P(W2|A) * P(W1'|A) = 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14

Now, we can find P(A):
P(A) = P(A ∩ W1) + P(A ∩ W1') = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26

{probability: 0.26}
