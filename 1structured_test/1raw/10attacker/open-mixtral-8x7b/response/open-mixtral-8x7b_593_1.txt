Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, and in this case, claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness made an error. Given the population distribution, there's a 20% chance that the first witness misjudged the height.
4. To calculate the final probability, we can use the law of total probability, which states that the final probability is the sum of the product of each possible scenario and its probability.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is:
   0.8 (probability that the first witness is correct) + 0.2 (probability that the first witness is wrong) * 0.15 (probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller given the city's population distribution).

The final answer is: {probability: 0.8 + 0.03 = 0.83}
