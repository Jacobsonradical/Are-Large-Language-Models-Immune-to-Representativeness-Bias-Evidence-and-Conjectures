Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a problem of dependent events because the two witnesses' statements are not consistent.
3. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is the same as the probability that the first witness is correct when saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. This probability is 0.8 (80%), as stated in the problem.

So, {probability: 0.8}
