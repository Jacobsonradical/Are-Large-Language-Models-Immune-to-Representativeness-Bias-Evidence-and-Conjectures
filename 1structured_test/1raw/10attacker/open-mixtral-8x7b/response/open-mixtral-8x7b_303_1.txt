Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- A represents "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B represents "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller"

We're interested in finding P(A|B), or the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so.

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness would say the attacker was 185 cm or taller when they actually were. This is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B): The probability that the first witness would say the attacker was 185 cm or taller. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A). Here, P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is 1 - 0.7 (30%) = 0.3. P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, so it's 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. Plugging these values in, we get P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.255.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.467.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.467 or 46.7%.
