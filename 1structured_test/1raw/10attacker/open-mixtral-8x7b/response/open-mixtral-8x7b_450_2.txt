Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their error rate of 30%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1) = P(witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
