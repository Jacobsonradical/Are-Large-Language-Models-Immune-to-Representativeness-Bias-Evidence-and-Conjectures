Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 30% of the time.

Given that one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other said they were shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 correctly identifies height) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 incorrectly identifies height) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (1-0.8)*(1-0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.07
= 0.19 or 19%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 19%.
