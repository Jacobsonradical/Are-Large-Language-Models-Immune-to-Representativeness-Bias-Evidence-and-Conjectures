Let's analyze the information given:

a) Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both pieces of information in a Bayesian analysis.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Let W1 and W2 be the statements made by the first and second witnesses, respectively.

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (First witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

P(W2|A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (Second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we want to calculate P(A|W1, W2), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the statements made by the two witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1, W2)

To simplify the calculation, let's assume the errors made by the two witnesses are independent events. Then:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = (0.8) * (0.3) = 0.24

Now we need to calculate P(W1, W2), which is the probability of the two witnesses making their respective statements regardless of whether the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Let B be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1|B) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (First witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

P(W2|B) = 0.7 (Second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2|B) * P(B)

P(W1, W2) = (0.24) * (0.15) + P(W1, W2|B) * (0.85)

Calculating P(W1, W2|B) is complex, so we'll approximate it by averaging the probabilities of the two witnesses' statements when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1, W2|B) ≈ (P(W1|B) + P(W2|B)) / 2 ≈ (0.2 + 0.7) / 2 = 0.45

Now we can find P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) ≈ (0.24) * (0.15) + (0.45) * (0.85) ≈ 0.3975

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the statements made by the two witnesses:

P(A|W1, W2) ≈ (0.24) * (0.15) / 0.3975 ≈ 0.0908

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.0908}
