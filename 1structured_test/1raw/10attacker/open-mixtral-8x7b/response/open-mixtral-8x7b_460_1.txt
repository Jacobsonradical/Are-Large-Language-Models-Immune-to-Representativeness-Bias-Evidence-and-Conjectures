Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given these facts, we have more confidence in Witness 1's claim since their error rate is lower than Witness 2's for identifying a person of this height.

Now, let's calculate the probability based on the information provided.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A) given the information about the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) / P(W1, W2)

However, we don't have enough information to directly compute P(W1, W2 | A) and P(W1, W2). Instead, let's assume that the witnesses' testimonies are conditionally independent given A. This assumption simplifies the calculation and allows us to calculate the probability as follows:

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A)

Now, we can calculate P(W1 | A) and P(W2 | A) based on the given information.

P(W1 | A) = Probability of Witness 1 being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.8

P(W2 | A) = Probability of Witness 2 being correct when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.3

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A | W1, W2):

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
