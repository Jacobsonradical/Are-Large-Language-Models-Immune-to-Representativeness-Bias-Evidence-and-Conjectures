Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy for this claim is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy for this claim is 70%.
4. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the combined accuracy of both witnesses for this specific claim.
5. The probability of both witnesses being correct is the product of their individual accuracies (0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%).
6. However, it's also possible that Witness 1 is correct while Witness 2 is incorrect (0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 or 24%).
7. Adding these two probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (0.56 + 0.24 = 0.8 or 80%).

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.8}
