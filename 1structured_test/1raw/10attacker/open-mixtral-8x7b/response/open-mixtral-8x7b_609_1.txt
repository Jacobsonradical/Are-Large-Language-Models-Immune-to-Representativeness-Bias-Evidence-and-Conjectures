Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when he claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We will then multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability of both events happening together, which would suggest that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Probability of Witness 1 being correct:
- Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and he's correct 80% of the time.
- P(W1Correct) = 0.8

Probability of Witness 2 being correct:
- Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and she's correct 70% of the time.
- P(W2Correct) = 0.7

Now, let's consider the attacker's actual height distribution in the population:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

Given that Witness 2 is correct, the probability that Witness 1 would also be correct:
- P(W1Correct | W2Correct) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now we can calculate the overall probability of both witnesses being correct, which would indicate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
- P(W1Correct and W2Correct) = P(W1Correct) * P(W2Correct | W1Correct)
- P(W1Correct and W2Correct) = 0.8 * P(W2Correct | W1Correct)
- P(W1Correct and W2Correct) = 0.8 * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1Correct)
- P(W1Correct and W2Correct) = 0.8 * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1Correct and W2Correct) = 0.8 * 0.15

{probability: 0.12}

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12.
