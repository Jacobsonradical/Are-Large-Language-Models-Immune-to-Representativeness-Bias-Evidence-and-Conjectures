Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, and the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm. This would be the scenario where both witnesses' testimonies support the claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the first scenario: P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

Next, let's calculate the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. This would be the scenario where neither witness's testimonies support the claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the second scenario: P(1st incorrect) * P(2nd correct)
= 0.2 * 0.7
= 0.14

Since the two scenarios are mutually exclusive, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.

The final probability: P(185 cm or taller) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect) + P(1st incorrect) * P(2nd correct)
= 0.24 + 0.14
= 0.38

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.38}
