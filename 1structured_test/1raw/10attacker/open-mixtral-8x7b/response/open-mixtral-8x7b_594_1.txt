Let's break down the given information and calculate the probability:

1. We know that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
2. We also know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability:

We want to find the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller (A) given that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller (B). Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct with 80% probability)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two cases:
- If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, Witness 1 will correctly claim so with 80% probability: P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, Witness 1 will incorrectly claim they are 185 cm or taller with 20% probability: P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

The total probability P(B) is the sum of these two cases: 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
