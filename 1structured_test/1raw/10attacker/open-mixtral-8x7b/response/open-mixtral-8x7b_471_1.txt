Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we need to calculate the probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect.

First, let's find the combined correct identification rate for both witnesses:
(0.8 * 0.5) + (0.7 * 0.5) = 0.4 + 0.35 = 0.75 or 75%

Next, let's find the combined error rate for both witnesses:
(0.2 * 0.5) + (0.3 * 0.5) = 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25 or 25%

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the combined correct identification rate is 75%, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed:

{probability: 0.1125 or 11.25%}
