Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 made that claim.

First, let's find P(B|A):
- The probability that Witness 1 correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80%, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A):
- The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B):
- Since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and the attacker is 185 cm or taller 15% of the time, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, there is another scenario where Witness 1 could be correct: when both witnesses are correct, and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This scenario has a probability of 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7 (attacker is 185 cm or taller * Witness 1 is correct * Witness 2 is correct), which is 0.07 or 7%.

Since these are the only two scenarios where Witness 1 is correct, we can find P(A|B) by adding these probabilities together:

P(A|B) = 0.07 + 0.12 = 0.19 or 19%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 19%.
