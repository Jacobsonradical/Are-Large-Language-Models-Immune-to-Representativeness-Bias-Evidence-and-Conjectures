Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time when they make this claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means they believe witness 1 is wrong. This witness is correct 70% of the time when they disagree with witness 1's assessment.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim, we need to consider both witnesses' reliability.

Let's assume there are 100 people in the city for simplicity. According to the given information, 15 of them would be 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's look at the two scenarios where witness 1 is correct and where they are incorrect:

Scenario A - Witness 1 is correct:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (12 people out of 15).
- Witness 2 disagrees with witness 1 and incorrectly thinks the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time (4 people out of 15).

Scenario B - Witness 1 is incorrect:
- Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (3 people out of 15).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (10 people out of 15).

Now, we can calculate the probability of witness 1 being correct by adding the number of people in scenario A and dividing by the total number of people (12 + 3 = 15). The probability of witness 1 being correct is 15 out of 26 or approximately 0.577.

Therefore, the answer is:
{probability: 0.577}
