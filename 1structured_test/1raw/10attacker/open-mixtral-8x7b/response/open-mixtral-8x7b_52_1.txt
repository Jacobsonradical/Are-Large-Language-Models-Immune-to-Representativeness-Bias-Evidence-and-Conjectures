Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
	* Witness 1 correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
	* Witness 2 correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

Since both witnesses contradict each other, we cannot use their testimonies directly to estimate the attacker's height. However, we can calculate the probability of each witness being correct given their individual abilities.

For Witness 1:

* The probability of being correct is 0.8 (80% chance)
* The probability of being incorrect is 0.2 (20% chance)

For Witness 2:

* The probability of being correct is 0.7 (70% chance)
* The probability of being incorrect is 0.3 (30% chance)

Given that the population has 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct by multiplying the base rate of 15% with the witness's accuracy:

Probability(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (or 12%)

Given the same base rate, we can calculate the probability of Witness 2 being correct as well:

Probability(185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.7 = 0.105 (or 10.5%)

However, we cannot directly use these probabilities as our final answer because the witnesses contradict each other. It is important to note that these probabilities reflect the likelihood of the witnesses being correct, not the attacker's actual height.

To provide an estimate strictly in the required format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

We cannot provide a single numerical estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller since there is conflicting evidence. The most we can say is that, given the information provided, there is a higher probability that Witness 1 is correct (12%) compared to Witness 2 (10.5%).
