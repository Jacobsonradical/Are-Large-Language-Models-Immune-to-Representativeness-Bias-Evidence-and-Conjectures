Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, W1 and W2, who made conflicting statements about the attacker's height, which is either below or at 185 cm. W1 has an 80% success rate and 20% error rate, while W2 has a 70% success rate and 30% error rate in judging a person's height under similar conditions.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed. Since W1 and W2 have conflicting statements, let's assume just one is correct. We'll calculate the probability for each witness and combine the results.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller, given W1) = P(W1 correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(W1 incorrect) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed, is:

{probability: 0.29}
