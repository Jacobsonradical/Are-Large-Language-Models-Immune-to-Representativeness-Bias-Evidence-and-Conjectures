Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To calculate this, we need to consider the accuracy of both witnesses.

First, let's calculate the combined probability that both witnesses correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller:

P(both correct) = P(witness 1 correct) * P(witness 2 correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Next, let's calculate the combined probability that both witnesses incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller:

P(both incorrect) = P(witness 1 incorrect) * P(witness 2 incorrect)
= 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.06

Now, we need to consider the base rates of people being 185 cm or taller in the city's population. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Given the witnesses' testimonies, we now want to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both witnesses) = [P(both correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(both correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(both incorrect) * P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller)]
= [0.56 * 0.15] / [(0.56 * 0.15) + (0.06 * 0.85)]
= 0.084 / (0.084 + 0.051)
= 0.084 / 0.135
â‰ˆ 0.6222

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6222}
