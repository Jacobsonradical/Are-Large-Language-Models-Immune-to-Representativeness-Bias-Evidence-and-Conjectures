Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct and multiply it by the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(W1|A) = Probability of Witness 1 being correct given attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(W2|A') = Probability of Witness 2 being correct given attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.7
P(A'|W2) = Probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm given Witness 2's claim = 1 - P(A|W2)

We want to find P(A|W1,W2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(W1,W2|A) or P(W1,W2). Instead, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct:

P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

Now, we can find the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller:

P(W1,W2|A') = P(W1|A') * P(W2|A') = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Since the two events (attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is shorter than 185 cm) are mutually exclusive, we can calculate the total probability P(W1,W2) as the sum of the probabilities of both scenarios:

P(W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) + P(W1,W2|A') = 0.4 + 0.06 = 0.46

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) * P(A) / P(W1,W2) = 0.4 * 0.15 / 0.46 â‰ˆ 0.1304

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1304 or 13.04%.
