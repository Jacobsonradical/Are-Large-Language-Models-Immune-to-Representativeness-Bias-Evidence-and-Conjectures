Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, and the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as being shorter than 185 cm. This would be the scenario where both witnesses' testimonies align, indicating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the first scenario: P(185 cm or taller, correct for witness 1, incorrect for witness 2)
= P(185 cm or taller) * P(correct for witness 1 | 185 cm or taller) * P(incorrect for witness 2 | shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.036

Similarly, let's calculate the probability that the first scenario is the opposite: the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and both witnesses incorrectly identified the attacker's height as being 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the second scenario: P(shorter than 185 cm, incorrect for both witnesses)
= P(shorter than 185 cm) * P(incorrect for witness 1 | shorter than 185 cm) * P(incorrect for witness 2 | shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.051

To get the final probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller after considering both scenarios, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(185 cm or taller | both testimonies) = P(185 cm or taller, correct for witness 1, incorrect for witness 2) / [P(185 cm or taller, correct for witness 1, incorrect for witness 2) + P(shorter than 185 cm, incorrect for both witnesses)]
= 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.051)
= 0.036 / 0.087
= 0.41376

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41 (41%).
