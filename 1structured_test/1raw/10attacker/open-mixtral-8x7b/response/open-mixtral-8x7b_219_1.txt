To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability of each witness's claim being true, and then weighing them according to their reliability.

First, let's find the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) 

From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We also know that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller. So, we can calculate:

P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Thus, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Next, let's find the probability that the second witness is correct when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2's claim) = P(Witness 2's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. We also know that Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So, we can calculate:

P(Witness 2's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Thus, P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2's claim) = 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595

Now, we can use the law of total probability to find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' claims:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) * P(Witness 1's claim) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2's claim) * P(Witness 2's claim)

We don't have information about the prior probability of each witness's claim. However, since both witnesses made conflicting claims, it's reasonable to assume that they each have an equal chance of being correct:

P(Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 2's claim) = 0.5

Finally, we can calculate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.12 * 0.5) + (0.595 * 0.5) = 0.3075 + 0.2975 = 0.605

{probability: 0.605}
