Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Our goal is to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case:
- Event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 made that claim.

To calculate this, we need to find the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the accuracy of witness 1, which is 80%.
- P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% (from point b).
- P(B): the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the probability that the witness is incorrect and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (0.2) * (0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
