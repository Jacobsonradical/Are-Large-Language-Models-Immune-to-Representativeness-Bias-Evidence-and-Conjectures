Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.
4. Since both witnesses made contradictory statements, they cannot both be right. Therefore, one of them must be wrong.
5. If we assume that the first witness is correct (the attacker is 185 cm or taller), then the second witness must be wrong. Given that the second witness is wrong 30% of the time, this provides some evidence for the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
6. However, if we assume that the second witness is correct (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), then the first witness must be wrong. Given that the first witness is wrong 20% of the time, this also provides some evidence for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
7. To estimate the probability that the first witness is correct, we need to compare these two probabilities. Given the error rates of the two witnesses, the probability that the first witness is correct is higher than the probability that the second witness is correct.
8. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, would be higher than 0.5 (but less than 1, since the first witness could still be wrong).

Answer: {probability: 0.6, reasoning: based on the given information and assuming both witnesses make errors independently, the probability that the first witness is correct is higher than the probability that the second witness is correct}
