Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we need to calculate the probability that both witnesses' statements are true given their individual error rates.

4. The probability that the first witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12% since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and the first witness is correct 80% of the time.
5. The probability that the second witness is correct (attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is (1 - 0.15) * 0.7 = 0.63 or 63% since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and the second witness is correct 70% of the time.

Now, we need to find the probability that the first witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the second witness is also correct (attacker is shorter than 185 cm), given their individual probabilities:

6. The probability that they are both correct is 0.12 * 0.63 â‰ˆ 0.0756 or 7.56%.

Since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, the answer is:

{probability: 0.0756}
