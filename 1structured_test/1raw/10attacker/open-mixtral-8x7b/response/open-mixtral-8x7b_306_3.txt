Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%. So when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an (80% * 15%) = 12% chance that the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%. This means that when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, there's a (70% * 85%) = 59.5% chance that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. This also implies that there's a (100% - 59.5%) = 40.5% chance that the person is actually 185 cm or taller when Witness 2 says they are shorter than 185 cm.
4. Given Witness 2's claim, we should consider both possibilities, but since Witness 1 directly supports the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we weigh their claim more.

Our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 12% + (40.5% * 0.8)} = {probability: 0.524 or 52.4%}

This estimate accounts for both witnesses' claims, but weighs Witness 1's claim more due to their higher accuracy rate.
