Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of event A (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) given event B (first witness's claim).
- P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A, which is 0.8 (first witness's accuracy).
- P(A) is the prior probability of event A, which is 0.15 (population percentage).
- P(B) is the probability of event B, which is a combination of P(B|A)*P(A) and P(B|not A)*P(not A).

Calculating P(B) requires us to calculate the probability of the second witness being correct, which is P(B|not A) = 0.7 (second witness's accuracy) and P(not A) = 0.85 (population percentage).

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A)*P(A) + P(B|not A)*P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.7*0.85 = 0.635.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.635 = 0.1921182

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.192 (19.2%).
