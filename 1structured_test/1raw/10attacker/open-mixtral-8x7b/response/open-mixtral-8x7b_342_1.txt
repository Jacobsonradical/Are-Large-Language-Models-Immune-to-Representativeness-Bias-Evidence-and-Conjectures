Let's break down the information given and reason through it:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which has a base rate of 0.15.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing a person's height under similar conditions, and incorrect 20% of the time.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the hit rate for the first witness, which is the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This would be the base rate (0.15) multiplied by the witness's accuracy (0.8), resulting in 0.12 or 12%.

However, without any additional information about the prevalence of attackers' heights in this specific scenario, we cannot adjust this estimate based on the second witness's statement. Therefore, our final answer is:

{probability: 0.12}
