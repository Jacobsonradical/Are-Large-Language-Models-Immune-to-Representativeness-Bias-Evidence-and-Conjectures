Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and is wrong 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. To do this, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A|B) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.
- P(B|A) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), and we know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy). To find P(A|B), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B). We can use the law of total probability to find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is sometimes incorrect, they will claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a probability equal to their error rate, 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.343.
