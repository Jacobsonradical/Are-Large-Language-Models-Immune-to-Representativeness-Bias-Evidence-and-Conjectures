Given the information about the two witnesses' accuracy in estimating a person's height and the fact that one of them claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller while the other claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is equal to the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis, divided by the probability of the evidence:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

In this case, our hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is that one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller while the other claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(E|H) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are)
* P(E|~H) = 0.2 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter than 185 cm)
* P(H) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, based on the given population statistics)

To calculate P(E), we need to consider both possibilities:

* P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)
* P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|E) using Bayes' theorem:

* P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
* P(H|E) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.414.
