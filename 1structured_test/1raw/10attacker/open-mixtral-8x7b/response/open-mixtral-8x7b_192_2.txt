Let's first calculate the probabilities based on the two witnesses' testimonies:

Witness 1:
- Probability of being 185 cm or taller: true positive rate (80%) = 0.8
- Probability of being shorter than 185 cm: false positive rate (20%) = 0.2

Witness 2:
- Probability of being 185 cm or taller: true positive rate (70%) = 0.7
- Probability of being shorter than 185 cm: false positive rate (30%) = 0.3

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on both witnesses' testimonies.

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (population base rate).

For the attacker to be 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probabilities from both witnesses.

P(A|B1, B2) = P(A) * P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) + P(A) * P(B1|A) * P(not B2|A) * P(not B2|B1) + P(A) * not P(B1|A) * P(B2|not A) * P(not B1|B2)

where A is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, B1 is the event of witness 1's testimony, and B2 is the event of witness 2's testimony.

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B1, B2) = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7 + 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.7 + 0.15 * 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.3

Calculating this value, we get approximately 0.1647 (16.47%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1647}
