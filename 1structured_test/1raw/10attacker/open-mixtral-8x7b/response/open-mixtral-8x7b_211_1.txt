Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. 

Given that witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, and witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, it seems more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, since both witnesses agreed on this point.

However, to calculate an exact probability, we would need more information about how these two witnesses' errors are distributed. For example, if witness 1 tends to overestimate people's heights, then their error might be more likely to occur when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Similarly, if witness 2 tends to underestimate people's heights, then their error might be more likely to occur when the person is actually taller than 185 cm.

Without this information, we can't provide a precise numerical estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. But based on the information given, it seems more likely than not.

{probability: We cannot provide a precise numerical estimate without more information about the distribution of the witnesses' errors.}
