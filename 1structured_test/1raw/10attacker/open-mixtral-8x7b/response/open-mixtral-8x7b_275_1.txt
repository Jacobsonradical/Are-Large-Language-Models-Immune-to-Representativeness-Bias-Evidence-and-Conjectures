Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of both witnesses.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
3. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim.
4. Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, this means that the second witness must have been incorrect in their assessment. Given that the second witness is correct 70% of the time, this means they are incorrect 30% of the time.
5. Therefore, there is a 30% chance that the second witness was incorrect, and the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.

So, {probability: 0.3}
