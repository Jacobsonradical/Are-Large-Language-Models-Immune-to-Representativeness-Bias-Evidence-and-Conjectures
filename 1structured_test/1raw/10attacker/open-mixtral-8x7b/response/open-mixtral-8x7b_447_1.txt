3. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which agrees with their assessment 80% of the time.
4. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which disagrees with the first witness's claim. The second witness is accurate 70% of the time when they say a person is shorter than 1
