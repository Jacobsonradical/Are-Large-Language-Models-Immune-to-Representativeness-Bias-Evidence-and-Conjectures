Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness.
3. We'll use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability, but first, we need to make some assumptions.
4. Let's assume that both witnesses' abilities to judge height are independent of each other.
5. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
6. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
7. According to the problem, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(A) = 0.15 (15%).
8. From the problem, we know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when judging height, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
9. We also know that the first witness incorrectly claims a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(¬B|A) = 0.2, and thus P(¬B|¬A) = 0.2 (the false positive rate for someone shorter than 185 cm).
10. Now we can apply Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
11. We need to find P(B|¬A), the false positive rate for a person who is not 185 cm or taller: P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.
12. Plugging in the values: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.68) = 0.15.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
