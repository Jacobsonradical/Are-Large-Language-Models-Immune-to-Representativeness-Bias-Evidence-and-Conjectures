To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly says the attacker is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is not)

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
~ 0.37931

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.379 (37.9%).
