Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a problem of conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to solve it.
3. Bayes' theorem states: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
4. In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the other said the attacker was shorter than 1
