Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim, they must be incorrect 30% of the time.
5. But remember, there's only one attacker, so only one of these claims can be correct.
6. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both witnesses' reliability.
7. The first witness's claim has a 15% chance of being correct naturally, but they are actually correct 80% of the time when they make this claim.
8. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 15% * 80% + 0% * 20% = 12%.

{probability: 0.12}
