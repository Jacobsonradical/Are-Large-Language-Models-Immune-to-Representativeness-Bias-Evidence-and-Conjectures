Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since they contradict each other, the second witness must be incorrect in this case.
5. Given that the second witness is incorrect, we have no additional information to change our initial probability estimate from the city population data, which is 15%.

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.15}
