Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the information provided.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time under similar conditions.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185cm, which happens to be correct 70% of the time under similar conditions.
4. Given these witness testimonies, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller since both witnesses' claims point towards this possibility.
5. However, we also need to consider the error rates of the witnesses.

Let's calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents "the attacker is 185cm or taller" and B represents "one witness said the attacker was 185cm or taller and the other said the attacker was shorter than 185cm".

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

From the problem statement, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness accuracy)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (second witness error rate)
- P(A) = 0.15 (population statistics)
- P(not A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [(0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85))]

Now, compute the answer:

P(A|B) = [0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)] = 0.31818 (rounded to five decimal places)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.31818}
