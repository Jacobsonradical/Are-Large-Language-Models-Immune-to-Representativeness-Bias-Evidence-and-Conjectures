Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different claims, and they have different error rates in estimating a person's height.
3. Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can consider the case where the first witness is correct and the second witness is wrong.
4. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time. Thus, their probability of being both correct at the same time is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
5. However, we also need to consider the case where the first witness is wrong and the second witness is correct. This happens 20% of the time for the first witness and 30% of the time for the second witness, making their combined probability of being both wrong 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06.
6. Since there are only two possibilities (the attacker being taller or shorter than 185 cm), we can now calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim.
   The probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being wrong is 0.56, and the total probability of any event happening is 1.
   Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.56 / (0.56 + 0.06) = 0.9.
