Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker being in the taller group.
3. However, Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when estimating heights.
4. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts Witness 1's claim. Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time when estimating heights.

Given these pieces of information, we cannot definitively determine the attacker's height. However, we can estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct based on their individual error rate.

The probability that Witness 1 is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80% (0.8).

Therefore, our answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
