Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, the probability of them being correct is 80% (0.8) and the probability of them being incorrect is 20% (0.2). Since the witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we are interested in the probability of this statement being true, which is the probability of the first witness being correct.

For the second witness, the probability of them being correct is 70% (0.7) and the probability of them being incorrect is 30% (0.3). Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this statement being true is 1 - the probability of the second witness being correct, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability of both witnesses' claims being true.

We can calculate the combined probability of both witnesses' claims being true using Bayes' theorem:

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

In this case, event A is the first witness being correct, and event B is the second witness being correct.

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)
          = 0.15 * 0.8  // probability of the first witness being correct
          = 0.12

Now, we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), the probability of the second witness being correct. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

However, since the second witness claimed the opposite, we need to find the complementary probability:

P(B) = 1 - P(B when B is false)
    = 1 - (1 - 0.85) * 0.3  // probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
    = 1 - 0.09
    = 0.91

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
      = 0.12 / 0.91
      â‰ˆ 0.131868

{probability: 0.1319}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1319.
