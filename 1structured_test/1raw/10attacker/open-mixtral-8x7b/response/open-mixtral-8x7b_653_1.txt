To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given the following probabilities:

P(A) = probability that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(B1|A) = probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (20% error rate)
P(B2|A) = probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm = 0.50 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in P(A'|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A'|B1) = P(B1|A') * P(A') / P(B1)

First, we need to find P(B1|A'), the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the complement of the error rate, so P(B1|A') = 1 - P(B1|A) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80.

Next, we need to find P(A'), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A') = 0.15.

Finally, we need to find P(B1), the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this as the sum of the probabilities of the witness saying so when the attacker is actually shorter or taller than 185 cm:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(A')
= (0.20 * 0.85) + (0.80 * 0.15)
= 0.17 + 0.12
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A'|B1):

P(A'|B1) = P(B1|A') * P(A') / P(B1)
= (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
