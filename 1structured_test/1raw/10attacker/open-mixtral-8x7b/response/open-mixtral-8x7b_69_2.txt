To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the problem description, we know:
- P(B|A): the first witness correctly claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8
- P(A): the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15% or 0.15

Now we need to find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways:
1. The attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, and the first witness correctly claims so, which has a probability of P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15
2. The attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, but the first witness mistakenly claims so, which has a probability of P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85, where A' is the complement of A, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
