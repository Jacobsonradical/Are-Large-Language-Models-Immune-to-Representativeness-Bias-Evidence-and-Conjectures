To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height, and the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height, but the second witness's incorrect identification agrees with the first witness's claim.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A). Then the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm is P(A') = 1 - P(A).

From statement (a), we know that the first witness correctly identifies the correct height with a probability of 0.8, and errs with a probability of 0.2. Similarly, the second witness correctly identifies the correct height with a probability of 0.7, and errs with a probability of 0.3.

Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(A) \* 0.8 + P(A') \* 0.2

Given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our estimate of P(A):

P(A|first witness claims 185 cm or taller) = [P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller) \* P(A)] / P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller)

From statement (b), we know that the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. Therefore, we can use this as our prior probability P(A) = 0.15.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|first witness claims 185 cm or taller) = [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.264 or 26.4%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 26.4%. {probability: 0.264}
