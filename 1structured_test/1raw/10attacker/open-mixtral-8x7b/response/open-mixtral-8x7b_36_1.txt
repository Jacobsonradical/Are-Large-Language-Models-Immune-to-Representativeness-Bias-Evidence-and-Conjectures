Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy in such claims is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy in such claims is 70%.

Given these accuracies, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, based on witness 1's claim.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1 as the event that witness 1 correctly claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W2 as the event that witness 2 correctly claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We are looking for P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We know:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(W1). We can find this by considering two possibilities:
- W1 and A are both true (attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 1 is correct)
- W1 and not A (attacker is shorter than 185 cm and witness 1 claims they are 185 cm or taller)

P(W1) = P(W1 and A) + P(W1 and not A)
= P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
