To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given the observation that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller (event B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
P(A) = 15% (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% or 0.15 are 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 80% (the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 20% (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, meaning they identify the height as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(not A and B) = P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17
P(B) = P(A and B) + P(not A and B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
