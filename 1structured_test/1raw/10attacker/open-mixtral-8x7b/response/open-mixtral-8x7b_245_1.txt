Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such claims.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time in such claims.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim. To do this, we will calculate the probability of this scenario based on the information about both witnesses.

First, let's consider the case where both witnesses are correct. The probability of this happening is:
P(both_correct) = P(w1_correct) * P(w2_correct | w1_correct)

We know that P(w1_correct) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when claiming someone is 185 cm or taller), and P(w2_correct | w1_correct) = 0.5 (given that witness 1 is correct, there is a 50% chance that witness 2 is also correct, as they are judging opposite heights).

So, P(both_correct) = 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4

Next, let's consider the case where both witnesses are incorrect. The probability of this happening is:
P(both_incorrect) = P(w1_incorrect) * P(w2_incorrect | w1_incorrect)

We know that P(w1_incorrect) = 1 - P(w1_correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time), and P(w2_incorrect | w1_incorrect) = 0.5 (given that witness 1 is incorrect, there is a 50% chance that witness 2 is also incorrect, as they are judging opposite heights).

So, P(both_incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 made this claim:

P(attacker_tall | w1_claim_tall) = P(both_correct) + P(w1_incorrect)

This is because either both witnesses are correct, or witness 1 is incorrect and witness 2 is correct (since witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

P(attacker_tall | w1_claim_tall) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5}
