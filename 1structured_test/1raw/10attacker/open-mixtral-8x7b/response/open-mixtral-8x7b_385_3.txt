To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional probabilities of two events (A and B) to their joint and marginal probabilities. In this case, we want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (A) given the statement of the first witness (B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Let's break down each component:
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness would make this statement given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the accuracy of the first witness when the true height is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, 15% of the population fits this description.
- P(B): The probability of making this statement regardless of the attacker's true height. This is where we need to consider both possibilities - when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and when they are 185 cm or taller.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
