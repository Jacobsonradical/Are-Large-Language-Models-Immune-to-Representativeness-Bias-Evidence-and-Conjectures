Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement separately:

Witness 1: The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claims so, is 0.8 (80% chance that Witness 1 is correct).

Witness 2: The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 2 claims so, is 0.3 (30% chance that Witness 2 is correct since they erred 70% of the time).

Since both witnesses made conflicting statements regarding the attacker's height, we cannot simply multiply the probabilities. Instead, we need to calculate the probability that they both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and then calculate the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller given the population statistics.

The probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
P(W1_tall & W2_tall) = P(W1_tall) * P(W2_tall | W1_tall)
= 0.8 * (15% / (15% + 85%/2))
≈ 0.146

Now, we calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements:
P(Attacker_tall | W1_tall & W2_tall) = P(W1_tall & W2_tall & Attacker_tall) / P(W1_tall & W2_tall)
= (15% * 15% * 0.8) / 0.146
≈ 0.118

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.118}
