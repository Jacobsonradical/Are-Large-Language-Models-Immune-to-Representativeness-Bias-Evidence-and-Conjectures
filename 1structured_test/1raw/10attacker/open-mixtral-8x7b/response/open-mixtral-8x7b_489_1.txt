To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the statements of each witness and then combine these probabilities using their respective weights, which are determined by their reliability in estimating height.

First, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the first witness claims so (P(A|W1)), and when the first witness claims otherwise (P(A'|W1)):

P(A|W1) = Probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(A'|W1) = Probability that the first witness is incorrect when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given that the first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, we have:

P(A|W1) = 0.8
P(A'|W1) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Next, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the second witness claims so (P(A|W2)), and when the second witness claims otherwise (P(A'|W2)):

P(A|W2) = Probability that the second witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(A'|W2) = 1 - P(A|W2) = Probability that the second witness is incorrect when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given that the second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, we have:

P(A|W2) = 0.7
P(A'|W2) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, let's calculate the combined probability P(A) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the weights of each witness:

P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2)

We need to calculate the probabilities that each witness makes their statement (P(W1) and P(W2)), which can be calculated based on their reliability and the population statistics:

P(W1) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
= P(A) * 0.8 (when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) + P(A') * 0.2 (when the attacker is actually shorter)

P(W2) = Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
= P(A) * 0.7 (when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) + P(A') * 0.3 (when the attacker is actually shorter)

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = 0.15
P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(W1) and P(W2):

P(W1) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32
P(W2) = (0.15 * 0.7) + (0.85 * 0.3) = 0.105 + 0.255 = 0.36

Finally, we can calculate the combined probability P(A) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2)
= (0.8 * 0.32) + (0.7 * 0.36)
= 0.256 + 0.252
= 0.508

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.508}
