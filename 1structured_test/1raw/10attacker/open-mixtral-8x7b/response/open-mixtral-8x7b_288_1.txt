To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both witnesses and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness said the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- C as the event that the second witness said the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- W1 as the event that the first witness is correct about the height.
- W2 as the event that the second witness is correct about the height.

We want to find P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A):
P(B|A) = P(W1 is correct) = 0.8

Next, let's find P(A):
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, let's find P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 (or 41.38%).
