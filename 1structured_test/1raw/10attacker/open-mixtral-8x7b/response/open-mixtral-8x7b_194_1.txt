To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. 

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witness correctly identify a person's height, respectively. We want to find P(A | B1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

From the information given, we know that P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies an 185 cm or taller person 80% of the time), P(B1 | A') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are not 80% of the time), P(B2 | A) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time), and P(B2 | A') = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 30% of the time).

Using the law of total probability, P(A | B1) can be calculated as follows:

P(A | B1) = (P(B1 | A) * P(A)) / (P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | A') * P(A'))

We don't know the exact population proportions for P(A) and P(A'), but we do know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, i.e., P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Substituting the values for P(B1 | A), P(B1 | A'), P(A), and P(A'):

P(A | B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Now, calculate P(A | B1):

P(A | B1) = (0.12) / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
