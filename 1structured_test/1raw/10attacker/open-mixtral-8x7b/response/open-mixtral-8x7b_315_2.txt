Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time.
3. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the problem statement, we have:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (first witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(¬A), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

And we can calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
