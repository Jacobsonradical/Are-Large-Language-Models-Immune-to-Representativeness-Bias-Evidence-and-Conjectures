Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness.
3. We'll calculate the probabilities based on each witness's statement separately.
4. For the first witness, if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, they'd be correct 80% of the time (based on the witness's ability to judge a person's height).
5. However, since we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and considering the first witness's 80% accuracy rate, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement would be:
   0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.8) = 0.12 + 0.56 = 0.68

Our estimate is:
{probability: 0.68}
