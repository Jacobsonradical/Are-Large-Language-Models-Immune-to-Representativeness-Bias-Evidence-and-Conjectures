Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, or one witness being correct and the other being incorrect.

P(both correct) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(first witness correct) * P(second witness correct)
+ P(shorter than 185 cm) * P(first witness incorrect) * P(second witness incorrect)

P(first witness correct) = 0.8
P(first witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(second witness correct) = 0.7
P(second witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(both correct):

P(both correct) = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3)
P(both correct) = 0.084 + 0.0405
P(both correct) = 0.1245

However, we also need to consider the possibility of one witness being correct and the other being incorrect. Since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we will only calculate the probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect:

P(first correct, second incorrect) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(first witness correct) * P(second witness incorrect)
+ P(shorter than 185 cm) * P(first witness incorrect) * P(second witness correct)

P(first correct, second incorrect) = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.7)
P(first correct, second incorrect) = 0.036 + 0.117
P(first correct, second incorrect) = 0.153

Now, we can add these probabilities together to get our final estimate:

{probability: 0.1245 + 0.153 = 0.2775}
