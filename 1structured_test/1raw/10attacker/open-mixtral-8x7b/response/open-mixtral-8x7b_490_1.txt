Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (either below or at least 185 cm) 80% of the time, and is wrong 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, and is wrong 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

However, the information about the population doesn't seem to help us estimate the height of the attacker, since the attacker is one individual and not a representative sample of the city's population. So we'll focus on the information about the witnesses.

Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that this statement is true. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, we can use this percentage as our estimate:

{probability: 0.8}
