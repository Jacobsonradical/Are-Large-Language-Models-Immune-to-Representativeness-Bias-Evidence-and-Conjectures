Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.

2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller. This means that when they say someone is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.

3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when guessing if someone is shorter than 185 cm. This means that when they say someone is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance they're right.

4. However, since the second witness contradicts the first, their statements are mutually exclusive. We can't have the attacker being both 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm at the same time. So, we're interested in the scenario where the first witness is correct.

5. Therefore, given that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 80% (the first witness's accuracy rate).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
