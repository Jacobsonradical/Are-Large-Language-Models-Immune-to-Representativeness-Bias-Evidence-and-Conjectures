Let's break down the information given:

1. City statistics show that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80% when guessing a person's height.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70% when guessing a person's height.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given the first witness' accuracy, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still use the first witness's claim as evidence. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying people 185 cm or taller. To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct given their claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller)

We know P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (80% accuracy).

However, we don't have enough information to calculate the other probabilities directly. Instead, we can use the city statistics to estimate the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%).

Now, let's calculate the false positive rate for the first witness, which is the probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not:

P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Witness claims shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (20%)

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller):

P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:

P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%)

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41 (41%)

So, based on the given information, there is approximately a 41% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.
