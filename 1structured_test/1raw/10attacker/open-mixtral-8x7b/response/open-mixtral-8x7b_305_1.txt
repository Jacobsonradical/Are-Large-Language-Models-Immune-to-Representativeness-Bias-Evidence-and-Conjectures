To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A - the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
B - the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We are interested in calculating P(A|B), the probability of A given B. By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information provided, we know that:
1. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
2. P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
3. P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. This can be calculated as:
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
   where P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (given that they erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm).
   P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
   So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.13 (13%).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.13) = 0.092 or 9.2%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.092}.
