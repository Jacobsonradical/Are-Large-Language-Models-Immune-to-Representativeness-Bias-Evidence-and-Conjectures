To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 1
