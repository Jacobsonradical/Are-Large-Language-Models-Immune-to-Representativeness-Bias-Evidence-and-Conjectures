Let's analyze the information given:

a) Witness 1 correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.
Witness 2 correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's claim.

Let's consider the two scenarios:
1) Witness 1 is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2) Witness 1 is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information, the probability of each scenario is:

Scenario 1:
- The probability that Witness 1 is correct (0.8) multiplied by the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller (0.15) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Scenario 2:
- The probability that Witness 1 is incorrect (0.2) multiplied by the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Since the scenarios are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities to get the overall probability that Witness 1 is correct:

Probability = 0.12 (Scenario 1) + 0.17 (Scenario 2) = 0.29 or 29%

The answer is:
{probability: 0.29}
