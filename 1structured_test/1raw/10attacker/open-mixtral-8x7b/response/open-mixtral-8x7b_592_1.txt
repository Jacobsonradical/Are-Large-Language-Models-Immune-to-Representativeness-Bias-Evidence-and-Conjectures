Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a person chosen at random is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (probability of correct identification, or P(C|T)), and incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (probability of incorrect identification, or P(C|~T)).

3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 1
