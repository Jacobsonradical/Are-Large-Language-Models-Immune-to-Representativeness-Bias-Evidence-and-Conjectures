Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is incorrect 20% of the time under the given conditions.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is incorrect 30% of the time under the given conditions.
4. Since both witnesses cannot be wrong at the same time (the attacker cannot be both taller and shorter than 185 cm), we need to consider the most likely scenario.
5. If the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, there's a 30% chance that witness 2 would make that mistake.
6. If the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance that witness 1 would make that mistake.
7. Given that the error rate is higher for the witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, it's more likely that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, matching witness 1's claim.

So, based on the information provided, I estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller to be 0.8 (or 80%).

{probability: 0.8}
