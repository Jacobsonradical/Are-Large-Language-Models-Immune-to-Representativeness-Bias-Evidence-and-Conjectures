Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, when they say someone is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.
3. The second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time. So, when the first witness says someone is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says they're not, there's a 30% chance the first witness is correct.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claimed the opposite. We want to find the probability that the first witness is correct given these contradictory statements. 

This is a classic problem of dependent events. The probability that the first witness is correct when the second is not is 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate). The probability that the second witness is incorrect when they contradict the first is 0.3 (the second witness's error rate). 

So, the probability that the first witness is correct given that they contradict the second is 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.3) = 0.8 / 1.1 â‰ˆ 0.7273.

Answer: {probability: 0.7273}
