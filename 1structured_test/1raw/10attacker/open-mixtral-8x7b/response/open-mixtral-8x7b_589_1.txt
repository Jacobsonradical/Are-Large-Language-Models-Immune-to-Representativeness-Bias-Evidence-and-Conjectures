Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this probability as P(A).

According to witness 1, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Let's denote this statement as W1.

We know that the witness was correct 80% of the time when identifying people of that height. So we can write P(W1|A) = 0.8, where P(W1|A) means the probability of witness 1 making the statement W1 given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness was one of the 20% of cases where they erred. So let's denote the event that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm as ~A.

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. So P(~A) = 0.85. And since the witness is wrong 20% of the time when identifying people of that height, P(W1|~A) = 0.2.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W1), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 made the statement W1:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(~A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.18 / 0.34
= 0.5294 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.5294}
