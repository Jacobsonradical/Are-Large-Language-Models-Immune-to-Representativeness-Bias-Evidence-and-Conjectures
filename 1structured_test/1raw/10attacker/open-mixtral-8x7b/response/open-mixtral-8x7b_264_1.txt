Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
2. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and this witness claimed that the attacker was at least this tall.
3. To find the probability that Witness 1 is correct in this case, we can use the given information as if it were a prior probability and update it with the new evidence (the witness's statement).
4. The formula for this is P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
5. Plugging in the values, we get:
   - P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
   - P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
   - P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41
6. Now, we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.2927

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.2927}
