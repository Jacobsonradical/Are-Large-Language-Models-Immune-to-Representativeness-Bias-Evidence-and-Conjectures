Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different estimates, but we cannot use their statements directly because they contradict each other.
3. Instead, we can calculate the probability of each witness being correct and then combine these probabilities in a way that accounts for their independence (the fact that they did not discuss their answers).
4. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller AND the first witness being correct is 0.80 * probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
5. The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and this witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. So, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm AND the second witness being correct is 0.70 * (1 - probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller).
6. Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities: [0.80 * probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller] * [0.70 * (1 - probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)] = observed overall accuracy of witness testimonies, which is 0.56 (the product of 0.80 and 0.70 due to independence).
7. Rearranging the equation, we get: [probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller]^2 - (0.56 / 0.80) * [probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller] + (0.56 / 0.80 * 0.70) = 0.
8. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.64.
