Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% is 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we need to find the probability that both witnesses would make a mistake, and then subtract that from the total probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(W1 correct) = P(W1 claims 185 cm or taller) - P(W1 and W2 both incorrect)

First, let's calculate the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(W1 claims 185 cm or taller) = 1 (100%)

Next, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses make a mistake:
P(W1 incorrect) = 0.2 (20% chance of underestimating height)
P(W2 incorrect) = 0.3 (30% chance of overestimating height)

P(W1 and W2 both incorrect) = P(W1 incorrect) * P(W2 incorrect)
= 0.2 * 0.3
= 0.06 (6% chance of both being incorrect)

Now, we can calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct:
P(W1 correct) = P(W1 claims 185 cm or taller) - P(W1 and W2 both incorrect)
= 1 - 0.06
= 0.94

So, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.94}
