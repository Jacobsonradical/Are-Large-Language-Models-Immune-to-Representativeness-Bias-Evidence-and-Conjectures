Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each statement separately and then combine them based on the law of total probability.
3. The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.8 (80%).
4. The first witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.2 (20%).
5. Given the first witness's claim of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we now consider the second witness's statement.
6. The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with a probability of 0.7 (70%).
7. The second witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.3 (30%).

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) = P(first witness correct) * P(second witness incorrect)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
