Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claims so. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case:

A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B is the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claims so.

From the information given:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.4545

{probability: 0.4545}
