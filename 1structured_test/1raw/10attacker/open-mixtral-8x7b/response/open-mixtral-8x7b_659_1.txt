Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case, event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 (Witness 1 is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.297

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.297}
