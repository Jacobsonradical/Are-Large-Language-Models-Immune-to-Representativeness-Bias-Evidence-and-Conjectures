Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but this witness is only correct 80% of the time.
3. The population distribution shows that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.
4. To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- A as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(E|A), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From the problem, we are given:
- P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|E) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A|¬E) = 0.2 (the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

We can now apply Bayes' theorem:

P(E|A) = [P(A|E) * P(E)] / [P(A|E) * P(E) + P(A|¬E) * P(¬E)]

Substituting the given values:

P(E|A) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression gives us:

P(E|A) ≈ 0.4286 (or 42.86% if expressed as a percentage)

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.4286}
