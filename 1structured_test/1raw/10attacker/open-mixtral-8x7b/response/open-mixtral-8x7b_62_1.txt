Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement.

For the first witness, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that they claimed so, is 0.8 (their accuracy rate). The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population is 0.15 (from the given information). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness's statement:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate)
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

To calculate P(B|not A), we need to find the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since the first witness is wrong 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.2 * 0.85] = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.29 = 0.345 (rounded to three decimal places)

Given the information from the first witness, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
