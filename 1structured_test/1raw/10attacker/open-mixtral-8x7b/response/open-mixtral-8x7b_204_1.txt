Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

In this case:
- Event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We are asked for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

From the information above, we know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly claims the person is 185 cm or taller when they are not)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36.
