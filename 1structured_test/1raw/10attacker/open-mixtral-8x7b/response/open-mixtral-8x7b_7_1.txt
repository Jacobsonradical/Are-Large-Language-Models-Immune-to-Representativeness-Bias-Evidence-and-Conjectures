Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm and incorrect 30% of the time.

Since one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we should consider this information from the second witness:

- If the attacker was taller than 185 cm, the second witness would have a 30% chance of incorrectly claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- Therefore, if the first witness is correct, there is a 30% chance the second witness would be incorrect.

To find the overall probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, we multiply the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller (0.15) by the probability that the first witness is correct (0.8), and then multiply by the probability that the second witness would be incorrect in this scenario (0.3).

probability = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.036 or 3.6%

{probability: 0.036}
