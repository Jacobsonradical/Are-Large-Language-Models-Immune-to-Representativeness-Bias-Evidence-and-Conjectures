Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, since they correctly identify the correct height 80% of the time, and given that their statement implies the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability would be 0.8 (80%).

For the second witness, since they correctly identify the correct height 70% of the time, and given that their statement implies the person is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this statement being correct is actually the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (or 0.85) according to the city's population statistics.

However, these two probabilities are not equally reliable, as the second witness's statement is more in line with the general population statistics. To combine these probabilities, we can use the concept of likelihood where the more likely scenario (the second witness's statement) is used to weigh the less likely scenario (the first witness's statement).

The likelihood ratio in this case would be:
L = (probability of the first witness's statement being correct) / (probability of the second witness's statement being correct)
= 0.8 / 0.85
≈ 0.9412

Now, we can multiply the probability from the first witness's statement by this likelihood ratio to get the final estimated probability:

Estimated probability = 0.8 * 0.9412
≈ 0.7529

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7529}
