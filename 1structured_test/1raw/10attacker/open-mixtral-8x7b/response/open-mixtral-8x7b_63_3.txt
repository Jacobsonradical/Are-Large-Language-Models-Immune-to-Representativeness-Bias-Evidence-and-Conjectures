Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy).

However, we should also consider the possibility that the second witness could be correct. In this case, if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the second witness would be correct 70% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the second witness is correct is 0.85 (population statistic) * 0.3 (witness's error rate) = 0.255.

Now, we need to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so and the second witness is incorrect. Since the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time, this probability is 0.2 (witness's error rate).

Combining these probabilities, the final estimate is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * P(first witness is correct) + 0.2 * P(second witness is incorrect and attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.83

{probability: 0.83}
