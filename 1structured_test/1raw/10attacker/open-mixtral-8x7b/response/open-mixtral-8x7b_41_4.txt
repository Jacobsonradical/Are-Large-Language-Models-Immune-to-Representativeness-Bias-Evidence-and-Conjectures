Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. We can apply Bayes' theorem to find this probability.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / P(W1)

We are given:
P(W1|H) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (population proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W1), which can be calculated as:
P(W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|H') * P(H')
where H' represents the height being shorter than 185 cm, and P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

To find P(W1|H'), we need to consider that the second witness would have to claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, we have:
P(W1|H') = P(second witness says attacker is shorter than 185 cm | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.7 * 0.85

Now we can calculate P(W1):
P(W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|H') * P(H')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + ((0.7 * 0.85) * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.44025
= 0.56025

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):
P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / P(W1)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.56025
= 0.09255310657

Rounding to 3 decimal places, the answer is:

{probability: 0.093}
