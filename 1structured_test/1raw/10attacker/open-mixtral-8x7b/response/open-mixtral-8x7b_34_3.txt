Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating heights.
4. We can calculate the combined probability of both witnesses being correct when they both estimate the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
5. The first witness being correct AND the second witness being correct: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%.

However, we also need to consider the case where the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct. In this case, the first witness would have estimated the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, while the second witness correctly estimates the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

6. The probability of the first witness being incorrect is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 or 20%.
7. The probability of the second witness being correct when the first witness is incorrect is 0.7 (as the second witness's correctness doesn't depend on the first witness).
8. The combined probability of the first witness being incorrect and the second witness being correct is: 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 or 14%.

Now, to find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim, we need to add the probabilities from steps 5 and 8:

9. The overall probability is: 0.56 + 0.14 = 0.7 or 70%.

Answer: {probability: 0.7, "the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller"}
