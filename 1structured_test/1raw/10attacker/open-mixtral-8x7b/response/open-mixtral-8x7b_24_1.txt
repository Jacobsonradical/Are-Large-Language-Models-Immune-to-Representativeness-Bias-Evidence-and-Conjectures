Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each statement and then combine them using the formula for total probability.
3. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so (P(A|W1)), is 80% or 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate when the true height is 185 cm or taller).
4. The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the second witness said so (P(~A|W2)), is 70% or 0.7 (the second witness's accuracy rate when the true height is shorter than 185 cm).
5. The overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on both statements (P(A)), can be calculated as follows:
   P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2)
   We don't have information on P(W1) and P(W2), but since both witnesses are equally likely, we can assume P(W1) = P(W2) = 0.5
   P(A) = (0.8 * 0.5) + (0 * 0.5 * P(A and ~W2))
   We don't have information on P(A and ~W2), but since the overall probability should be between 0 and 1, we can exclude values that would result in a probability greater than 1.

Given the available information, it seems reasonable to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, to be around:

{probability: 0.8}
