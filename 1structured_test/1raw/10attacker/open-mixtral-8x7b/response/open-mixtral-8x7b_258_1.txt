Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.
4. According to the city's population statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct, given their individual accuracy rates and the city's population statistics:

P(Both correct) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 correct)
= 0.80 * 0.70
= 0.56

Next, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses are incorrect, meaning the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(Both incorrect) = P(Witness 1 incorrect) * P(Witness 2 incorrect)
= (1-0.80) * (1-0.70)
= 0.06 * 0.30
= 0.018

Given that the attacker's height is either 185 cm or shorter, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be calculated by adding the probability that both witnesses are correct and the probability that both witnesses are incorrect:

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = P(Both correct) + P(Both incorrect)
= 0.56 + 0.018
= 0.578

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.578}
