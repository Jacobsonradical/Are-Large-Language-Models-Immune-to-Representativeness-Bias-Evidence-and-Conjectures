To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From statement (b), we know that P(A) = 15% = 0.15, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B|A), we need to find the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is equal to 1, since the first witness's claim is always that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we need to find the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

We can use the law of total probability to express P(B) as P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A), where not A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From statement (a), we know that the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the complementary probability).

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(not A) = 85% = 0.85.

Putting it all together, we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 1 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.32

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
= 1 \* 0.15 / 0.32
= 0.46875

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 46.88%.

Answer: {probability: 0.46875}
