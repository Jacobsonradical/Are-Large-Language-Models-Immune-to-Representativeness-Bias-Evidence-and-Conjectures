Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 correcct) = 80% = 0.8
P(W2 correct) = 70% = 0.7

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct when the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(W1 correct & W2 correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(W1 correct) * P(W2 correct)
= 0.8 * 0.7
= 0.56

Next, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct when the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1 incorrect & W2 correct) = P(W1 incorrect) * P(W2 correct)
= 0.2 * 0.7
= 0.14

Now, since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 correct & W2 correct) = P(W1 correct & W2 correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(W1 correct & W2 correct)

We first need to calculate P(W1 correct & W2 correct), which is the sum of the probabilities of each witness being correct multiplied by the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the attacker not being 185 cm or taller:

P(W1 correct & W2 correct) = P(W1 correct & W2 correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(W1 incorrect & W2 correct) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
= 0.084 + 0.119
= 0.203

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 correct & W2 correct) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.203
â‰ˆ 0.4187

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 41.87%.
