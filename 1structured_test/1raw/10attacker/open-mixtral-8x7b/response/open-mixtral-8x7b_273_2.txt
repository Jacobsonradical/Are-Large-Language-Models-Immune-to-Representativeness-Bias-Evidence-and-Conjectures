Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, and in this case, claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the first witness was in the 20% of cases where they erred.
4. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be simplified as follows:
   P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claimed so) = P(witness claimed so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 1
