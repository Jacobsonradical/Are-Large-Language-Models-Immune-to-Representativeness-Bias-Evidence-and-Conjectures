Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct assessment 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct assessment 70% of the time.

Given these points, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, since Witness 1, who made that claim, is more accurate when identifying taller individuals.

However, to provide an exact probability, we would need to use Bayes' theorem, which requires knowledge of the joint and marginal probabilities of the witnesses' claims and the actual heights of attackers. Without this information, we cannot calculate an exact probability.

But based on the given information, we can say that Witness 1 is more reliable in determining height, so the probability leans towards the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Here's a rough estimate based on the given accuracy rates:
- The probability that Witness 1 is correct when saying someone is 185 cm or taller is 0.80.
- The probability that Witness 2 is correct when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm is 0.70.

Assuming these accuracies are independent, we can estimate the probability that both witnesses are correct:
0.80 * 0.70 = 0.56, or 56%.

This means that there's a 56% chance that the attacker is both 185 cm or taller and the witnesses are both correct. Since Witness 1 is more accurate when identifying taller individuals, we can infer that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is likely higher than 56%.

However, without more information, we cannot provide a specific numerical probability.

Answer: {probability: cannot be determined exactly without more information, but likely higher than 56% based on given accuracy rates}
