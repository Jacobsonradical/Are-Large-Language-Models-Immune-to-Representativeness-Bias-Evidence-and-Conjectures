To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A), and the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as P(W1|A). We are given that P(W1|A) = 0.8.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)

where ¬A is the complement of A, i.e., the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, and P(W1|¬A) is the probability that the first witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm. Given that the first witness erred in 20% of the cases, we have P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(¬A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1), we get:

P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (or 34.5%).
