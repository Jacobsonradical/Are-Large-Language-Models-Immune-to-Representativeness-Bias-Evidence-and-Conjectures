Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the first witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
3. We need to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

5. We are given the following probabilities:
   - P(B|A): The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%).
   - P(A): The probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15 (15%).

6. To find P(B), we need to consider two cases:
   - Case 1: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The probability of the first witness claiming this is P(B|A) = 0.8.
   - Case 2: The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of the first witness mistakenly claiming this is 1 - P(B|A') = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8, where A' represents the complementary event of A (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

7. So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) ≈ 0.68

8. Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.68 ≈ 0.1765

{probability: 0.1765}
