Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and has an 80% success rate in determining height. This means there's an 80% chance they're correct when they say someone is 185 cm or taller, and a 20% chance they're incorrect.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and has a 70% success rate in determining height. This means there's a 70% chance they're correct when they say someone is shorter than 185 cm, and a 30% chance they're incorrect.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.80 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
