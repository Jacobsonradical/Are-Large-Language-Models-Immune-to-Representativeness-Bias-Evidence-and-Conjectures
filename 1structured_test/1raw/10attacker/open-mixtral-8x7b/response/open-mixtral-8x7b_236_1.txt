Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim a person is shorter than 185 cm.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Person is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Now, we can find the probability that both witnesses are correct, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(1st witness correct and Person is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct) * P(Person is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(1st witness incorrect and 2nd witness correct) = P(1st witness incorrect) * P(2nd witness correct) * P(Person is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.119

Since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive, we can find the total probability by adding these two probabilities:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct and Person is 185 cm or taller) + P(1st witness incorrect and 2nd witness correct)
= 0.12 + 0.119 = 0.239

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.239}
