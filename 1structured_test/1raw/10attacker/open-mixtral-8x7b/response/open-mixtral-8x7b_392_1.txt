Let's reason through this problem:

We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which conflicts with the second witness's claim. 

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the reliability of the first witness and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. The base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's reliability, or 0.8.
- P(A) is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, or 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

The probability P(B) can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
- P(B and A), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the product of the reliability of the first witness and the base rate, or 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
- P(B and not A), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller but the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the probability that the first witness errs in their estimation, which is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2. The probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, so the probability that the first witness makes this error is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore, P(B) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

Therefore, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41, or 41%.

Answer: {probability: 0.41}
