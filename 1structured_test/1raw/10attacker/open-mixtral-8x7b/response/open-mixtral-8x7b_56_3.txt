Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness estimated the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness estimates the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the city's population statistics.
- P(B): The probability that the first witness estimates the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(B), we need to find the probability of the witness estimating correctly and estimating incorrectly:

- P(B and A): The probability that the witness estimates correctly that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(B and not A): The probability that the witness estimates incorrectly that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as the product of the probability that the witness estimates the height as 185 cm or taller (0.5, since half the population is 185 cm or taller) and the probability that the witness is incorrect (0.2, since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time). So, P(B and not A) = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.9

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.9 â‰ˆ 0.133

{probability: 0.133}
