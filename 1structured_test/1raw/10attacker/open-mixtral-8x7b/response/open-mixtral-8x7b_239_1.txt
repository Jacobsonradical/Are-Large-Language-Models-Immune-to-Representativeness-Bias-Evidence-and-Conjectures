Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claimed that the attacker had been 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time.
3. The second witness claimed that the attacker had been shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time.

Given these two conflicting statements, we need to weigh the reliability of each witness and combine their statements to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
- P(B): Probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(C): Probability of the second witness correctly identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm

From the given information, we know:
- P(A) = ?
- P(B) = 0.8
- P(C) = 0.7

We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since the two witnesses' statements contradict each other, we need to calculate the probability of their statements being correct given their error rates and the base rate (population percentage).

First, let's calculate the probability of the first witness being correct (P(B|A)) and incorrect (P(¬B|A)).
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)
- P(¬B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct (P(C|¬A)) and incorrect (P(¬C|¬A)).
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (second witness's correct identification rate)
- P(¬C|¬A) = 1 - P(C|¬A) = 0.3

Now, we need to weigh these probabilities based on the base rate (population percentage), which means calculating P(A) and P(¬A) using the 15% base rate.
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We can now calculate P(B) and P(C) using the law of total probability:
- P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
- P(C) = P(C|A) * P(A) + P(C|¬A) * P(¬A)

However, we are only given P(B) and P(C), and we need to solve for P(A). We can set up a system of equations and solve for P(A):

1. P(B) = 0.8 * P(A) + 0.2 * 0.85
2. P(C) = 0.2 * P(A) + 0.7 * 0.85

Solving this system of equations, we get:

P(A) ≈ 0.2143 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2143}
