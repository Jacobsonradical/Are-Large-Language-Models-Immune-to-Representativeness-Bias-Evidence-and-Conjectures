Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (either taller or shorter than 185 cm) 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time.
b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

To compute this, we need to calculate the probability of the first witness being correct in their claim and multiply it by the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

First, let's calculate the probability of the first witness being correct:
P(Correct|First Witness) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(First Witness correct if 185 cm or taller) + P(shorter than 185 cm) * P(First Witness correct if shorter than 185 cm)

Given the base rates, P(185 cm or taller) = 15% and P(shorter than 185 cm) = 85%.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller, and is incorrect 20% of the time. So, P(First Witness correct if 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(First Witness incorrect if 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.

Similarly, the first witness is correct 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm, and is incorrect 80% of the time. So, P(First Witness correct if shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 and P(First Witness incorrect if shorter than 185 cm) = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(Correct|First Witness):

P(Correct|First Witness) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 29%.
