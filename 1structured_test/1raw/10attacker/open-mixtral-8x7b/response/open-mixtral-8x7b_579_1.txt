Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- not A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- B is the event that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We are given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 (witness 1 is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into the formula:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + ((1 - 0.7) * 0.85))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.318

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.318 or 31.8%.
