To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. We will consider two cases: the first witness is correct and the second witness is correct.

First, let P(A) be the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) be the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From the given data, P(A) = 0.15 and P(B) = 0.85.

Let W1 and W2 be the events where the first and second witnesses are correct, respectively. We are interested in finding P(A|W1∩W2'), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness is correct and the second witness is not correct.

Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(A|W1∩W2') = P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') + P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2')

To compute these probabilities, we need the following values:

- P(W1|A): probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- P(W2'|A): probability that the second witness is not correct given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.30
- P(W1|B): probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20
- P(W2'|B): probability that the second witness is not correct given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.70

Now, we can calculate P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') and P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2'):

P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') = P(W1|A) \* P(W2'|A) \* P(A) = 0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15 ≈ 0.036
P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') = P(W1|B) \* P(W2'|B) \* P(B) = 0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.119

Finally, we can find P(A|W1∩W2'):

P(A|W1∩W2') = P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') + P(A ∩ W1 ∩ W2') ≈ 0.036 + 0.119 ≈ 0.155

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.155 or 15.5%.
