Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when he claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know that he is correct 80% of the time, and erroneous 20% of the time. Since the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, this means that the witness identified a person as being 185 cm or taller. So, we want to find the probability that the person the witness identified is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness identified them as such:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims 185 cm or taller) = true positive rate
= 0.8

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the second witness's testimony and our knowledge of the population. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the probability that the second witness would claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(second witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = false positive rate
= 1 - true negative rate
= 1 - 0.7
= 0.3

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, based on the second witness's testimony and our knowledge of the population:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness claims 185 cm or taller) * P(second witness claims 185 cm or taller) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness claims shorter than 185 cm) * P(second witness claims shorter than 185 cm)

We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the second witness will claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.85. Plugging in the values we have calculated above, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8) * P(second witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) + (0) * P(second witness claims shorter than 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8) * (0.7) + (0) * (1 - 0.7)
= 0.56

Finally, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses' testimonies are correct, i.e., the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(both witnesses correct) = P(first witness correct) * P(second witness correct | first witness correct)
= (0.8) * P(second witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8) * (0.7)
= 0.56

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.56}
