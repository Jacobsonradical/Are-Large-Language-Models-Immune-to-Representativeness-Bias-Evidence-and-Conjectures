Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time randomly.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which happens 85% of the time randomly.
5. But the second witness is correct only 70% of the time when making this claim and errs 30% of the time.
6. Given these accuracies, it seems more likely that the first witness is correct because the attacker being 185 cm or taller is a less common occurrence, and the first witness is more likely to be correct when making this claim.

Now let's compute:
We want to find the probability that the first witness is correct, given that they claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This is the definition of conditional probability, which can be computed using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We have P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when making such a claim), P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller), and we need to find P(B).

P(B) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
