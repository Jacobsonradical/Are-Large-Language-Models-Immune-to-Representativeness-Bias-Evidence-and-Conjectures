Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but their statement is not consistent with the first witness's claim.
5. Since the second witness's statement contradicts the first, we can disregard the second witness's claim for this particular estimation.
6. So, given the first witness's claim and their 80% accuracy rate, we can estimate the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 (or 80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
