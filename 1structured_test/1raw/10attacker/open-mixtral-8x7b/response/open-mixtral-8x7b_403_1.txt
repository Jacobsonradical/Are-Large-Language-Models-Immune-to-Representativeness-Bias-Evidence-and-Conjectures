Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. This is a conditional probability, often written as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that Witness 1 made this claim.

However, the information about Witness 2's claim is not immediately useful in calculating this probability. Instead, it helps us calculate the probability that both witnesses would make inconsistent statements, given the attacker's actual height.

If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, then Witness 1's statement is correct and Witness 2's statement is incorrect with a probability of 0.3 (since Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time).

If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, then Witness 1's statement is incorrect with a probability of 0.2, and Witness 2's statement is correct.

Since we have no further information about the attacker's height, we cannot definitively calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's statement alone. However, given the high error rate of Witness 2 when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we might lean towards assuming that the attacker was likely this height if we had to make an estimate.

Following the format you requested: {probability: we cannot accurately provide a number without more information}
