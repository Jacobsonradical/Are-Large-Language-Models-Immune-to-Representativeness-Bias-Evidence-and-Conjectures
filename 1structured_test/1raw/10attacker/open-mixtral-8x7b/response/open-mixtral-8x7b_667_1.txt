Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be correct if the attacker truly was 185 cm or taller (15% of the population) and the witness correctly identified the height (80% probability).
5. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement would be the product of the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller and the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.

probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, there is a 12% chance that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.
