Let's reason through this problem:

We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, while the second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We also know the distribution of heights in the city's population.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the combined accuracy of the two witnesses when they both claim that the person is 185 cm or taller.

Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, and Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's assume that both witnesses claim the person is 185 cm or taller. Given Witness 2's error rate, there's a 30% chance they would make an error and the person would actually be shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this results in a 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255 or 25.5% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, even though both witnesses claim they saw someone 185 cm or taller.

Taking this into account, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, would be:

1 - 0.255 = 0.745

So, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.745}
