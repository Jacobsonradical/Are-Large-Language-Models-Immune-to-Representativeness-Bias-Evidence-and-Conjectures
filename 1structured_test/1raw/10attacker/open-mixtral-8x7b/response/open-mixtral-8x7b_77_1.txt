Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time under similar conditions. So, the likelihood of the claim given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
3. However, the first witness also incorrectly claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this happening is 0.2.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which happens to be correct 70% of the time under similar conditions. So, the likelihood of the claim given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.
5. The probability we want to find is the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)], where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
7. Plugging in the numbers, we get P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4286.
