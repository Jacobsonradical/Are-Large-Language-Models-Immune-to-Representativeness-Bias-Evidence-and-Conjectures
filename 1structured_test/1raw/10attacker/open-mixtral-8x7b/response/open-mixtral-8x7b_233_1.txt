To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will consider the two possibilities: the first witness is correct and the second witness is correct. 

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

According to the information provided, the first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(A|W1) = 0.8.
The second witness is correct 70% of the time, so P(A|W2) = 0.7.

Now we need to find the probabilities of each witness being correct, independent of the attacker's height.

For the first witness, P(W1) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness is incorrect. We know from the information given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is more likely to be correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. So we can estimate P(W1) as:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Similarly, for the second witness, P(W2) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the witness is incorrect. We can estimate P(W2) as:

P(W2) = P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W2|¬A) * P(¬A)
= (0.7 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)
= 0.105 + 0.255
= 0.36

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2)
= (0.8 * 0.29) + (0.7 * 0.36)
= 0.232 + 0.252
= 0.484

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.484} (48.4%).
