Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the combined accuracy of the two witnesses when they both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Witness 1 claims the correct height 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
Witness 2 claims the correct height 70% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.

However, we also need to consider the cases where both witnesses make a mistake. Since they both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability of them both being wrong, which means the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Witness 1 errs 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
Witness 2 errs 30% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate the combined accuracy when both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(both correct) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Now let's calculate the combined error rate when both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(both wrong) = P(Witness 1 wrong) * P(Witness 2 wrong) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both claim 185 cm or taller) = [P(both claim 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(both claim 185 cm or taller)

We already have P(both correct) = 0.56, and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. We need to find P(both claim 185 cm or taller). Since the two events are independent, we can calculate it as follows:

P(both claim 185 cm or taller) = P(both correct) + P(both wrong) = 0.56 + 0.06 = 0.62

Now we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both claim 185 cm or taller) = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.62 â‰ˆ 0.1355

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1355 or 13.55%.
