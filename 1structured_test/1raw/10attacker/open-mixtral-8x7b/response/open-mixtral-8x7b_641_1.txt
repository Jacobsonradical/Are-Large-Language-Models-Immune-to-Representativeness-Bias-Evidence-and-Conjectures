To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as P(A), where A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A) as follows:

P(A) = P(W1 and W2 | A) \* P(A) / P(W1 and W2)

where W1 and W2 are the events that the first and second witnesses made their respective claims, and P(W1 and W2) is the probability of both witnesses making their claims.

First, we can calculate P(W1 and W2 | A), the probability of both witnesses making their claims given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is always correct in this case, and the second witness has a 30% error rate, we have:

P(W1 and W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \* P(W2 | A) = 1 \* (1 - 0.3) = 0.7

Next, we can calculate P(A), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(A) = 0.15

Finally, we need to calculate P(W1 and W2), the probability of both witnesses making their claims. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of all possible combinations of the witnesses' claims, weighted by the probabilities of those combinations. We have:

P(W1 and W2) = P(W1 and W2 | A) \* P(A) + P(W1 and W2 | not A) \* P(not A)

where not A is the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate P(W1 and W2 | not A) as follows. Since the first witness has a 20% error rate and the second witness has a 30% error rate, we have:

P(W1 and W2 | not A) = P(W1 | not A) \* P(W2 | not A) = 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06

The probability of not A can be calculated as:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Putting it all together, we have:

P(W1 and W2) = P(W1 and W2 | A) \* P(A) + P(W1 and W2 | not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.7 \* 0.15 + 0.06 \* 0.85
= 0.1545 + 0.051
= 0.2055

Substituting the values of P(W1 and W2 | A), P(A), and P(W1 and W2) into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A) = P(W1 and W2 | A) \* P(A) / P(W1 and W2)
= 0.7 \* 0.15 / 0.2055
= 0.5357

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 53.57%.

Answer: {probability: 0.5357}
