Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, they correctly identify people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. Given this information and the population statistics, we can calculate:

P(Tall | Witness1) = P(Witness1 is correct) * P(Tall) + P(Witness1 is incorrect) * P(Short)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

For the second witness, they correctly identify people 185 cm or taller 70% of the time and err 30% of the time. Given this information and the population statistics, we can calculate:

P(Tall | Witness2) = P(Witness2 is correct) * P(Tall) + P(Witness2 is incorrect) * P(Short)
= (0.7)*(0.15) + (0.3)*(0.85)
= 0.105 + 0.255
= 0.36 or 36%

However, since both witnesses' testimonies are available, we want to combine their statements. We can do this by using the product rule of probabilities.

P(Tall | Witness1 and Witness2) = P(Tall | Witness1) * P(Tall | Witness2)
= (0.29)*(0.36)
= 0.1044 or 10.44%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1044}
