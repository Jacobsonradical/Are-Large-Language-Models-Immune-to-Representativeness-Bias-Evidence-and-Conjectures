Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and this witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.
5. Given the second witness's statement, we would initially estimate that the attacker is more likely to be shorter than 185 cm (70% likelihood).
6. However, since the two statements contradict each other, we need to consider both possibilities.
7. The probability that the first witness was correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 (12%).
8. The probability that the second witness was correct and the attacker is shorter than 1
