Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a case of dependent events because the two witnesses' statements are not equally reliable.
3. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
4. However, we don't know if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. We only know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
5. So, we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 or 15%.
6. Given this, the probability that the first witness is correct in his statement (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

Answer: {probability: 0.12}
