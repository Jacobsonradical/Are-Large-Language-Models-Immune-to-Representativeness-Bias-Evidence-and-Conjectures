To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' accuracy and the population's height distribution.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness's statement that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
C: The second witness's statement that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
W1: The event that the first witness is correct.
W2: The event that the second witness is correct.

From the information provided, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)
P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies short people 30% of the time)

Now we need to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement (B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B), which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

To find P(B|A), the probability of the first witness stating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that they actually were:
P(B|A) = P(W1|A) = 0.8

To find P(B|not A), the probability of the first witness stating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that they actually were not:
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(W1|not A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now we have all the values required to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85) = 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.68) = 0.15 / 0.83 â‰ˆ 0.181

Format answer:
{probability: 0.181}
