Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating someone's height as 185 cm or taller.
3. In the general population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller (from statement "b").
4. To combine these two pieces of information, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the person is 185 cm or taller.
- W as the event that the first witness estimated the person's height to be 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(A|W), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness estimated their height as such.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

We have P(W|A) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and P(W) is the probability of the witness estimating the height as 185 cm or taller, regardless of the true height.

We can calculate P(W) as follows:
P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|not A) * P(not A)

First, we need to calculate P(W|not A), the probability of the witness estimating the height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3, since the second witness is correct 70% of the time).

Then, we can calculate P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):
P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 = 0.32

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
