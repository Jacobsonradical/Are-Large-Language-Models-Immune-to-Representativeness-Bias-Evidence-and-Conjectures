To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the concept of conditional probability and the information provided about the reliability of the two witnesses.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 represent the events that witness 1 and witness 2 respectively have claimed the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.

First, let's compute the probability of B1 (first witness claiming the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller) given A (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller):

P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)

Next, let's compute the probability of B1 (first witness claiming the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller) given not A (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm):

P(B1 | not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly claims the person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability P(A) is 0.15.

Now, we can apply the Bayes theorem to compute the posterior probability P(A | B1):

P(A | B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) / P(B1)

To compute P(B1), we need to find the weighted sum of P(B1 | A) and P(B1 | not A) using the prior probability P(A):

P(B1) = P(B1 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | not A) * P(not A)

P(B1) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness claimed so is:

{probability: 0.257, "This number is rounded to three decimal places, as the provided information has limited precision"}
