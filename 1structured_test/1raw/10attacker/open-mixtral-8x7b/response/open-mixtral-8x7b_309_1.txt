Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct and identifying an 185 cm or taller person as such. Given their 80% accuracy rate, this would be 0.8.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the first witness being incorrect and identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not. This would be the complement of their accuracy rate, or 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of the second witness being correct and identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are. Given their 70% accuracy rate, this would be 0.7.

The likelihood of the second witness being incorrect and identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller as 15%.

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the first witness's testimony.

P(B|A) is the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (the likelihood of the first witness being correct when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller).

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

P(B) is the probability of the first witness's testimony, which is a weighted sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and incorrect:

P(B) = P(B and correct) + P(B and incorrect)

P(B and correct) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(B and incorrect) = P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.051

So P(B) = 0.12 + 0.051 = 0.171

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.171 â‰ˆ 0.695

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.695}.
