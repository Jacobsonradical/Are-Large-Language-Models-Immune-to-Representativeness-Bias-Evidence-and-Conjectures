To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of statistical quantities.

Let's define:
A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1 as the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

From the data:
P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the city's population statistics.
P(W1) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W1) = P(W1 and A) + P(W1 and not A)
= P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
