Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can find the probability of each testimony being correct and then multiply them to get the overall probability.
3. The first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
4. The second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making this claim.
5. We want to find the probability that both of these events occur, i.e., the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identified this, while the second witness incorrectly identified the height as being shorter than 185 cm.
6. The probability that the first witness is correct is 0.8, and the probability that the second witness is incorrect is 0.3 (since they are independent, we multiply their probabilities together to get the overall probability).

Therefore,
{probability: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24, rounded to 2 decimal places}
