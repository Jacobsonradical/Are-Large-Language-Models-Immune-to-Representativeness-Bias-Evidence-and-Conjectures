Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, we know that they are correct 80% of the time when guessing if a person is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is 0.8.
