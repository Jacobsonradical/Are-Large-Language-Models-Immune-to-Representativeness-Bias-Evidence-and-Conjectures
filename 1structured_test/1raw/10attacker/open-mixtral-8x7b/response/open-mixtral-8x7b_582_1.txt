Let's reason through this problem:

We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone under 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it's more likely that the second witness is correct. However, we only care about the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

To compute this probability, we need to consider the accuracy of both witnesses. If the first witness is correct, then the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. If the first witness is incorrect, then the attacker's height is still 185 cm or taller if the second witness is also incorrect.

Let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct:
P(1st witness correct) = P(1st witness says 185 cm or taller) * P(1st witness correct | 1st witness says 185 cm or taller)
= (0.5) * (0.8)
= 0.4

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is also incorrect:
P(1st and 2nd witness incorrect) = P(1st witness says under 185 cm) * P(1st witness incorrect | 1st witness says under 185 cm) * P(2nd witness incorrect | 1st witness says under 185 cm)
= (0.5) * (0.2) * (0.3)
= 0.03

Finally, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, can be calculated as follows:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | 1st witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct) + P(1st and 2nd witness incorrect)
= 0.4 + 0.03
= 0.43

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: {probability: 0.43}
