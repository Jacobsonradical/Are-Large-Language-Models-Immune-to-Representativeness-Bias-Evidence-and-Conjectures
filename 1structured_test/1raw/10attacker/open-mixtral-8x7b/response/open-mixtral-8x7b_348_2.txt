Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which we'll denote as A, and the witness correctly identifies the height, which we'll denote as W1|A. The probability of this happening is:

P(A ∧ W1|A) = P(A) * P(W1|A)

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15. 
The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8.

Therefore, P(A ∧ W1|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which we'll denote as ~A, and the witness mistakenly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, which we'll denote as W1|~A. The probability of this happening is:

P(~A ∧ W1|~A) = P(~A) * P(W1|~A)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(~A) = 0.85.
The first witness mistakenly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, so P(W1|~A) = 0.2.

Therefore, P(~A ∧ W1|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

The total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the two probabilities calculated above:

P(W1) = P(A ∧ W1|A) + P(~A ∧ W1|~A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we want to know the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.12 / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
