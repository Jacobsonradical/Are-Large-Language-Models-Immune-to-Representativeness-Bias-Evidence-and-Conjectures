Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the available information.
3. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
4. However, we also know that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. The second witness is correct 70% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.7.
5. Since the second witness contradicts the first, we can assume that only one of their statements is correct. Thus, P(not B) = 0.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.8*0.15 + 0.7*(1-0.15)) = 0.1471 (rounded to four decimal places).

The answer is: {probability: 0.1471}
