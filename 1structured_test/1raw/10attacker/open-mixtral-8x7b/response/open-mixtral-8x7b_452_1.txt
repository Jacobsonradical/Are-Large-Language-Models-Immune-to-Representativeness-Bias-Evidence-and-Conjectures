Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find out the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so. This is a conditional probability and can be written as P(A|B), where A is the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "Witness 1 claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller".

To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Here, P(B|A) is the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the information provided.

To compute P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller (A'). 

- P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(B|A') is the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. Since Witness 1 errs 20% of the time when making this claim, P(B|A') = 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645.

Finally, we can compute the desired conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4538

So, given that Witness 1 claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability of this being true is approximately 0.4538 or 45.38%.
