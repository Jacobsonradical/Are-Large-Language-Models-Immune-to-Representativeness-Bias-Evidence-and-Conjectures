Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when he claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is incorrect when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that:
- P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
- P(1st witness incorrect) = 0.2
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from part b)
- P(2nd witness incorrect) = 0.3

We want to calculate:
P(1st witness correct AND 2nd witness incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(1st correct AND 2nd incorrect) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect | 1st correct)

To calculate P(2nd incorrect | 1st correct), we have:
P(2nd incorrect | 1st correct) = P(1st correct | 2nd incorrect) * P(2nd incorrect) / P(1st correct)

We know that:
- P(1st correct) = 0.8
- P(2nd incorrect) = 0.3
- P(1st correct | 2nd incorrect) = 0.5 (assuming independence between the two events)

So, we have:
P(2nd incorrect | 1st correct) = 0.5 * 0.3 / 0.8 = 0.1875

Now, we can calculate:
P(1st correct AND 2nd incorrect) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect | 1st correct) = 0.8 * 0.1875 = 0.15

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.15}
