To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following approach:

1. Compute the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Compute the likelihood of the first witness being incorrect when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. Compute the prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the city's population statistics.
4. Use Bayes' theorem to combine these probabilities.

We are given:
- P(C|H1) = 0.8 (first witness is correct when saying attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~C|H1) = 0.2 (first witness is incorrect when saying attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C) = 0.15 (prior probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H1|C) = [P(C|H1) * P(H1)] / [P(C|H1) * P(H1) + P(~C|H1) * P(~H1)]
= [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)]
â‰ˆ 0.5122

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.5122 or 51.22%.
