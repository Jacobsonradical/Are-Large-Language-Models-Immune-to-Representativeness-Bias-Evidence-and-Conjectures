To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identified the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

First, compute P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Next, compute P(B|¬A) * P(¬A):
P(B|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17)
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4951

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4951}
