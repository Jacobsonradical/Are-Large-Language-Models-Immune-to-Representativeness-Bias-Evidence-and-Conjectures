Let's break down the given information:

a) We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height correctly:
- Witness 1: 80% success rate, 20% error rate
- Witness 2: 70% success rate, 30% error rate

b) We also know the distribution of the city's population:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the information from both witnesses. Since they disagree on the attacker's height, we must consider the possibility that one of them is incorrect.

To find the probability that both witnesses are correct, we can multiply their individual success rates: (0.8) * (0.7) = 0.56 or 56%

However, we also need to find the probability that only the first witness is correct since the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. To do this, we can multiply the success rate of the first witness by the error rate of the second witness: (0.8) * (0.3) = 0.24 or 24%

Finally, we need to consider the distribution of the city's population. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our base probability.

Combining all the probabilities, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(both correct) + P(only first witness correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.56 + 0.24 * 0.15
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.56 + 0.036
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.596

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.596}
