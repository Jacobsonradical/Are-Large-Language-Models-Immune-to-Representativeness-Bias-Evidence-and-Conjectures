Let's analyze the information given and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's testimony.

We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. The first witness claims that the attacker had been 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy rate. Thus, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- Event B is the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

First, let's find P(B|A):
The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A):
We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to find P(B). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We already have P(B and A) from our previous calculation, which is 0.8 (the probability of the first witness being correct). To find P(B and not A), we can use the first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The first witness errs 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B and not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 (the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not). Thus, P(B and not A) = 0.17.

Finally, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.8 + 0.17 = 0.97.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.97 â‰ˆ 0.1247.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1247 (12.47%).
