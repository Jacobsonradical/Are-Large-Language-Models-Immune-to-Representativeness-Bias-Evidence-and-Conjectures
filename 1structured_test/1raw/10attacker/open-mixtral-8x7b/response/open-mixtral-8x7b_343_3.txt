Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller, based on the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
3. To use this information, we can calculate the probability of the witness being correct and the attacker being 185cm or taller, given that the witness said so: P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker is 185cm or taller" and B is the event "witness said the attacker was 185cm or taller."
4. Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
5. We know that P(B|A) is the accuracy of the witness, which is 0.8.
6. P(A) is the probability of a random attacker being 185cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.
7. P(B) is the probability of the witness saying the attacker is 185cm or taller, which is a combination of two scenarios: the attacker is actually 185cm or taller and the witness is correct, and the attacker is not 185cm or taller but the witness incorrectly identifies them as such.
8. So, P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ A') = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41
9. Now we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 ≈ 0.293

{probability: 0.293}
