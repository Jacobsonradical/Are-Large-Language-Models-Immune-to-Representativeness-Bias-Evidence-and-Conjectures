Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts witness 1's claim but aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given these conditions, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on witness 1's claim.

We have two scenarios:
   A) Witness 1 is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller (80% probability)
   B) Witness 1 is incorrect and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (20% probability)

Since these are mutually exclusive events, we can find our total probability by adding their individual probabilities.

Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(A) + P(B)*P(witness 2's error)
= 0.8 + (0.2 * 0.3)
= 0.8 + 0.06
= 0.86

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.86}
