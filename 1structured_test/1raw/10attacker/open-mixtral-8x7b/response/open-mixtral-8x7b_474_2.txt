Let's break down the information given and reason through it.

1. The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy rate.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed. To calculate this, we need to find the combined accuracy rate of both witnesses supporting this claim.

Witness 1 accuracy rate: 80%
Witness 2 accuracy rate when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller: 30% (100% - 70%)

Now, we need to find the probability of both witnesses agreeing on the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. This means the first witness must be correct (80% chance) and the second witness must be one of the 30% of cases where they incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller.

So, the combined accuracy rate of both witnesses agreeing on the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is:

0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
