Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who is good at judging height, said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who is not as good as witness 1, said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time.
4. According to population statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given these pieces of information, we want to calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct, meaning that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. 

To calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, we need to multiply their individual probabilities of being correct:

P(both correct) = P(witness 1 correct) * P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct)

P(witness 1 correct) = 0.8

For P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct), we need to calculate the probability that witness 2 is correct, given that witness 1 is also correct. Since we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, this gives us:

P(attacker is taller than 185 cm | witness 1 correct) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, we know that there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and that witness 2 is correct 70% of the time. Given that witness 1 is correct and identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we now have a higher chance that the attacker's height is actually in that category. Thus, we can estimate the probability of witness 2 being correct, given that witness 1 is correct, to be higher than 0.15.

However, without more information about how these witness errors are distributed or correlated, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer for P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct). Therefore, we cannot give a definitive probability estimate for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller based on these two witnesses' testimonies alone.
