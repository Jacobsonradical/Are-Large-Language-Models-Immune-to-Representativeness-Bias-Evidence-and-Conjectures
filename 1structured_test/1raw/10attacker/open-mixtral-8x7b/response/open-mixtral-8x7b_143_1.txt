Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct and identifying an attacker of 185 cm or taller as such. We know this witness is correct 80% of the time, or 0.8 probability.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the second witness being correct when identifying an attacker as shorter than 185 cm. The second witness is correct 70% of the time, or 0.7 probability.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that an attacker is in this group, given the first witness's claim.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the probability of A
- P(B) is the probability of B

In our case:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

First, we need to find P(B|A). This is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller. We know this probability is 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(A). This is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we know is 0.15.

Finally, we need to find P(B). This is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We know P(B and A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly claims so, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

We also know P(B and not A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the first witness incorrectly claims so, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345, or 34.5%.
