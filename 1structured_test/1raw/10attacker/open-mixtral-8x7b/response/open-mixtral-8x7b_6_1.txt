Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

P(B|A) is the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (or 80%).
P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (or 15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:

1. Witness 1 is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This has a probability of P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12 (or 12%).
2. Witness 1 is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This has a probability of P(B|A') * P(A') = (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17 (or 17%),
   where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|A') is the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (or 20%), and P(A') is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Now, we can find P(B) by adding these two probabilities:
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (or 29%).

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.12) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.41 (or 41%).

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
