Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
3. However, we also need to account for the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.
- P(A) is the base rate of people who are 1
