Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Given these conditions, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as Witness 1 claimed.

To compute this, we need to find the probability of both conditions being true:
a) The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
b) Witness 1 is correct.

The probability of both conditions being true is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller AND Witness 1 being correct.

Probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
Probability of Witness 1 being correct = 0.8

However, we also need to account for the probability that Witness 2 is incorrect, as their statement contradicts Witness 1.

Probability of Witness 2 being incorrect = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, we multiply these probabilities together to estimate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim:

Estimated probability = 0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3 â‰ˆ 0.036 or 3.6%

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.036}
