Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. So, we will only consider the testimony of the first witness who claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making such claims (and errs 20% of the time).
5. In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed is:
{probability: 0.12}
