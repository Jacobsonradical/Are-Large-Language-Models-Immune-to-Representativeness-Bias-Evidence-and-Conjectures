Let's break down the information given:

1. City statistics show that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim.

To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where:
A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B is the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(A|B)

From the given information, we can calculate the following probabilities:

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.15 (if the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, and since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability of witness 1 making this error is 15%)
P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.15 * (1 - 0.15)))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5128

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 51.28%.
