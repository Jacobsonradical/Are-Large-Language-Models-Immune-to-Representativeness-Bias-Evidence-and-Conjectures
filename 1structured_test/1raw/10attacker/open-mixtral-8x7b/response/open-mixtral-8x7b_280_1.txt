To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which allows us to update our beliefs based on evidence. In this case, the initial belief is the distribution of heights in the city's population, and the evidence is the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Let's denote:
- P(A): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A' ): Probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W1|A): Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(W1|A'): Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- P(W2|A): Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- P(W2|A'): Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

According to the problem:
P(A) = 0.15
P(A') = 0.85
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
P(W1|A') = 0.2 (first witness errs and says the person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (second witness errs and says the person is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
P(W2|A') = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Now we can compute:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A')

Plugging in the values:
P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35
P(A|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.35 = 0.12 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.34

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.34.
