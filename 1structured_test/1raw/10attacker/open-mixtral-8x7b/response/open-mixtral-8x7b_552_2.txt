Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. So, we will focus on the error rates of the first witness. The first witness claims to be correct 80% of the time and err 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185cm or taller.
4. According to the city's statistics, 15% of the population is 185cm or taller. Thus, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is indeed 185cm or taller.
5. To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
6. Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
7. We are interested in P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
8. P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185cm or taller, which is 80%.
9. P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, which is 15%.
10. P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller, which is a combination of the witness correctly identifying a tall attacker (80% * 15%) and incorrectly identifying a short attacker (20% * 85%).
11. Plugging in the numbers, we get: P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]

The final answer is:
{probability: 0.5556, rounded to four decimal places, 55.56%}
