Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses, each with some probability of being correct about the attacker's height. Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy rate. Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy rate.

b) We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the information from the witnesses. We can express this as P(A|B), where A is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B is the information provided by the witnesses.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. 

P(B|A) is the probability of the witnesses saying what they said, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) is the probability of a random attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population statistics.

P(B) is the probability of the witnesses saying what they said, regardless of whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Now, let's calculate P(B|A) and P(B|not A):

P(B|A) = P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND Witness 2 says attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 2 says attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

P(B|not A) = P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller AND Witness 2 says attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 2 says attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85
= 0.036 + 0.119
= 0.155

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.155
â‰ˆ 0.2387

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 23.87%.
