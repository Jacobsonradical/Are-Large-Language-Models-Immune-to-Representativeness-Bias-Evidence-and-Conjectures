Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller."

We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

To calculate this probability, we need to find the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.15 (15%), as mentioned in b).
- P(B): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
  - P(B and A): the probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.15 (15% of the population) * 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy) = 0.12 (12%).
  - P(B and not A): the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. This probability is 0.85 (85% of the population) * 0.2 (the first witness's error rate) = 0.17 (17%).
  So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 (29%).

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345 (34.5%).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.345 (34.5%).
