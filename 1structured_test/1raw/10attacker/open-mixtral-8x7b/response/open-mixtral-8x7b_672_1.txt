Let's analyze the given information:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
b) The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.
c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the city's population. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B). To do this, we need to consider the two possible scenarios:
1) The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct. This probability is P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
2) The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and the first witness is incorrect. Since the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when claiming someone is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B|A') = 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255.

Since these are two mutually exclusive scenarios, we can find P(B) by adding their probabilities:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375.

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.32.
