Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the testimony of the first witness.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The population distribution in the city is such that 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To compute the probability, we need to consider the likelihood of the first witness being correct, given that they claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) is the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of the first witness making the claim they made, which can be computed as the sum of the probabilities of them being correct and making the claim, and being incorrect and making the claim.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
