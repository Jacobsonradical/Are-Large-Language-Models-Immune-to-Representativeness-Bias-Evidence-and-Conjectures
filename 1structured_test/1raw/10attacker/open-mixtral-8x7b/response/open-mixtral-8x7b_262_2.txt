Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (identifying a person as shorter than 185 cm) 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs (identifying a person as 185 cm or taller) 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. To do this, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct and multiply it by the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

First, let's calculate the probability of the first witness being correct. If the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, the first witness will be correct with a probability of 0.8 (80%). However, if the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm, the first witness will still claim they are 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 (20%). Since the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population is 0.15 (15%), we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct as follows:

P(Witness is correct) = P(Witness is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness is correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.14
= 0.26

So, the probability of the first witness being correct is 0.26. Now, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

{probability: 0.26 * 0.15, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.039, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
