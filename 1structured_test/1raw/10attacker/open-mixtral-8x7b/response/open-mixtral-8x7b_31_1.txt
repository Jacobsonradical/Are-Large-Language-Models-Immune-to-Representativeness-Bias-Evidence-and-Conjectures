Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness's statement.

Given the first witness's reliability of 80% and the fact that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 1
