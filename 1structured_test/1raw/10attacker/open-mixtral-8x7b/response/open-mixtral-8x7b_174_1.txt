Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in determining if a person is 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the combined accuracy of the two witnesses when they both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, let's consider the case when both witnesses agree that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when both correctly identify a person who is 185 cm or taller or when both incorrectly identify a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm.

The probability of both witnesses correctly identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 (or 56%).

The probability of both witnesses incorrectly identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (or 6%).

Therefore, the combined accuracy when both witnesses agree that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.56 + 0.06 = 0.62 (or 62%).

However, we also need to consider the case when only one of the witnesses claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Due to the complexity of these calculations and the limited information provided about how the two witnesses' errors are related, we cannot provide an exact probability for this scenario.

Given that we only have information about the combined accuracy when both witnesses agree, we will only provide an estimate based on that scenario.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.62}.
