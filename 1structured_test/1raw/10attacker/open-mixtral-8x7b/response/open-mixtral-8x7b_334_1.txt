Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we'll use the first witness's claim for this calculation.

Given the first witness's track record, when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, they are correct 80% of the time. Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
