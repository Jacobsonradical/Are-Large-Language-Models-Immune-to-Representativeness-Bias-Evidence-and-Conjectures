To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We have information about two witnesses and the general population distribution.

Let's denote:
P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(B) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller
P(W1|B) as the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is shorter than 185 cm
P(W2|A) as the probability that the second witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller
P(W2|B) as the probability that the second witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker really is shorter than 1
