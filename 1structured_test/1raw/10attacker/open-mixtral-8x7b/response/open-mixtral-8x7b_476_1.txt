Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%). Next, we'll calculate the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (20%). 

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' testimonies.

We can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- not A is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- B is the event that the first witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%)
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%)
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20%)
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%)

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
