Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's statement. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making such judgments.

To calculate this probability, we can use the witness's reliability as a weight. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can say that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, it's essential to acknowledge that the information provided in (b) about the city's population distribution may have an impact on this estimate. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it might seem more likely that the attacker falls into that category. However, this population distribution is not directly related to the reliability of the witness, which is the only information we should use when estimating the probability based on the given conditions.

So, the answer to this question is:

{probability: 0.8} (or 80%)
