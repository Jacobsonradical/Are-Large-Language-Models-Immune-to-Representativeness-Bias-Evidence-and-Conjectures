Let's analyze the information given:

There are two witnesses with different claims about the attacker's height. We want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Witness 1:
- Correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time
- Errs and says a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time

Witness 2:
- Correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time
- Errs and says a person is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time

We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 1
