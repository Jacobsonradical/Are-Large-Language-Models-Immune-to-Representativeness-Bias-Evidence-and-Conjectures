Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

To do this, let's calculate the likelihood of both witnesses making the claims they did, assuming the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:
P(1st witness claims 185 cm or taller, attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(2nd witness claims shorter than 185 cm, attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3 (since the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)

Now, let's calculate the joint probability of both events:
P(both claims, attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st claim) * P(2nd claim) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Next, we need to calculate the joint probability of both claims, assuming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(1st witness claims 185 cm or taller, attacker is shorter) = 0.2 (since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
P(2nd witness claims shorter than 185 cm, attacker is shorter) = 0.7
P(both claims, attacker is shorter) = P(1st claim) * P(2nd claim) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Finally, we calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given both witness claims, by applying Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both claims) = P(both claims, attacker is 185 cm or taller) / [P(both claims, attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(both claims, attacker is shorter)]
= 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.14)
= 0.24 / 0.38
= 0.631578947368421

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.631578947368421}
