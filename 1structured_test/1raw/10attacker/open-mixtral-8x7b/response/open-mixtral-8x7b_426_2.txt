To reason through this problem, we can use conditional probabilities and apply Bayes' theorem. We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (H1) given the first witness's statement. Let's denote the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller as W1.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) / P(W1)

From the data provided, we have:
- P(W1|H1) = 0.8 (first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to compute P(W1), the probability of the first witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate this probability by considering both possibilities:
- P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) = 0.8 \* 0.15
- P(W1|H2) \* P(H2) = 0.2 \* 0.85 (where H2 is the complement of H1, i.e., the height is shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.18 + 0.17 = 0.35

Now, we can find the required probability:
P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) / P(W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.35 â‰ˆ 0.343

Answer: {probability: 0.343}
