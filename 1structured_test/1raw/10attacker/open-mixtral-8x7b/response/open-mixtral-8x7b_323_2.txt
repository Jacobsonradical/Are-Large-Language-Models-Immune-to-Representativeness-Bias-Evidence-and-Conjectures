Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if a person is 185 cm or taller. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating if a person is shorter than 185 cm.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses agreed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use their statements to calculate the probability.

First, let's find the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
P(1st correct) = 0.8

Next, let's find the probability that the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm:
P(2nd incorrect) = 1 - P(2nd correct) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, let's find the probability that an attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is the probability of the city's population that meets this criterion:
P(185+) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate:
P(185+ | 1st correct and 2nd incorrect) = [P(1st correct) * P(185+)] / [P(1st correct) * P(185+) + P(2nd incorrect) * (1 - P(185+))]

Substituting the values:
P(185+ | 1st correct and 2nd incorrect) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)] = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255) = 0.12 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
