Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, one who correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The other witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the combined probability of both witnesses identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

First, consider the case where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 will correctly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and Witness 2 will correctly identify the attacker as being 185 cm or taller 70% of the time. So, the probability of both witnesses correctly identifying the attacker as being 185 cm or taller is:

0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 or 56%

However, we also need to account for the cases where one or both witnesses are incorrect. Since Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time, and Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time, there are several possible combinations of incorrect identifications. We'll calculate the probability of each combination and then sum them up:

1. Witness 1 is incorrect, and Witness 2 is correct:
   0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 or 14%

2. Witness 1 is correct, and Witness 2 is incorrect:
   0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 or 24%

3. Both witnesses are incorrect:
   0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%

Now, sum up the probabilities of all correct and incorrect combinations:

0.56 (both correct) + 0.14 (W1 incorrect, W2 correct) + 0.24 (W1 correct, W2 incorrect) + 0.06 (both incorrect) = 0.99% or 99%

So, given the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 99%.

Answer: {probability: 0.99}
