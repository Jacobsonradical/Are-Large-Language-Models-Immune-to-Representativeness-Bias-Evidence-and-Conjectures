To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Based on Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A): The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases:
1. P(B|A) * P(A): The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which happens with probability P(A) = 0.15, and the first witness correctly identifies this, which happens with probability P(B|A) = 0.8. So, P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. P(B|A') * P(A'): The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which happens with probability P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens with probability P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A') = 0.2. So, P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Adding these cases, we have P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
