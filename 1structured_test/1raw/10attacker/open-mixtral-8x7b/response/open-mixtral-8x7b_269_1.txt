Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making such claims.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making such claims.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses.

We want to find P(A|B1 and B2), where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, B1 is the observation made by Witness 1, and B2 is the observation made by Witness 2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B1 and B2) = P(B1 and B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1 and B2)

We're interested in finding P(A|B1 and B2), so let's compute each term separately:

P(A) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15%)

P(B1 and B2|A) = P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= P(Witness 1 is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 2 is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (24%)

Now, we need to compute P(B1 and B2), which is the probability of both witnesses making their respective claims, regardless of whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

P(B1 and B2) = P(B1 and B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1 and B2|not A) * P(not A)

We already have P(B1 and B2|A) = 0.24, and P(A) = 0.15. Now we need to find P(B1 and B2|not A) and P(not A).

P(not A) = P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (85%)

P(B1 and B2|not A) = P(Witness 1 is incorrect and Witness 2 is correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
+ P(Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= (0.2 * 0.7) + (0.8 * 0.3) = 0.28 (28%)

Now, we can find P(B1 and B2):

P(B1 and B2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.28 * 0.85 = 0.216 + 0.238 = 0.454 (45.4%)

Finally, we can compute P(A|B1 and B2):

P(A|B1 and B2) = P(B1 and B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1 and B2)
= 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.454
