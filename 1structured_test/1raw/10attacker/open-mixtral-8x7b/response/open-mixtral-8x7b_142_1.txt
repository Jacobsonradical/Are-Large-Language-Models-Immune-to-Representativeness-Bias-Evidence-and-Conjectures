Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability.

Let A be the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B be the event "the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness thinks so.

We can calculate P(A|B) using the formula:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A). This is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B). This is the probability that the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A). To find P(B|not A), this is the probability that the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

To find P(not A), this is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(not A) = 0.85.

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, let's find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
