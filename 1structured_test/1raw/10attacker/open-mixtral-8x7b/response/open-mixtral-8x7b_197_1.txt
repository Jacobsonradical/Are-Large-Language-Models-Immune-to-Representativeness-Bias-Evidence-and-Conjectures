Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution states that 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. Since both witnesses cannot be right, we need to consider two scenarios:
   A. The first witness is correct.
   B. The first witness is not correct.
4. The probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of the first witness being incorrect is 0.2.
5. In scenario A, since the first witness is correct, the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
6. In scenario B, since the first witness is incorrect, it means that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. But this contradicts the second witness's statement, which means that either the second witness is incorrect, or the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller.
7. To resolve this contradiction, let's calculate the probability of the second witness also being incorrect when the first witness is incorrect, given the population distribution:
   P(second witness incorrect) = 0.3 (since the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
   P(attacker height 185 cm or taller | first witness incorrect) = P(first witness incorrect) x P(second witness incorrect) = 0.2 x 0.3 = 0.06
8. To find the overall probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, we can add the probabilities of the two scenarios:
   P(attacker height 185 cm or taller) = P(first witness correct) + P(first witness incorrect and second witness incorrect) = 0.8 + 0.06 = 0.86

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.86}
