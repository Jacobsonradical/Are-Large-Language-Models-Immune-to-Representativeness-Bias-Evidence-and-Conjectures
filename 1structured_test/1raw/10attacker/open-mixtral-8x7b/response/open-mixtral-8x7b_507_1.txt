Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

We will apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

To calculate Bayes' theorem, we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B):

P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the first witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% in the problem.

P(B): The probability that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller. To find this, we need to consider two cases:

1) The attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness will claim this 80% of the time.
2) The attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The first witness will claim incorrectly that the attacker is 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(B) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29 or 29%.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
