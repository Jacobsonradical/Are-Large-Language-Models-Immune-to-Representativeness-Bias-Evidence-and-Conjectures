Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is accurate 80% of the time and inaccurate 20% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is accurate 70% of the time and inaccurate 30% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.

b. We know the distribution of heights in the city's population: 85% are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so:

1. Since Witness 1 is accurate 80% of the time, there is an 80% chance that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller if Witness 1 claims so.
2. However, since Witness 1 can also make mistakes (20% of the time), there is still a 20% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, even if Witness 1 claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. We need to weigh these two probabilities based on the prevalence of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 15% (from point b).
4. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, can be calculated as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.29}
