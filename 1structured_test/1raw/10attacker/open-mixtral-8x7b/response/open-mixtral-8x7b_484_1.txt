Given the information about the two witnesses' ability to judge a person's height, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller by calculating the weighted average of their claims.

First, let's consider the claim of the first witness who said that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since 80% of the time this witness is correct when making such a claim, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.8.

Next, let's consider the claim of the second witness who said that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Since 30% of the time this witness is correct when making such a claim, we can assume that the probability of the attacker being shorter than 1
