Let's analyze the information given:

A. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

B. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

First, let's calculate P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) which is equal to the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller plus the probability that the witness is mistaken.

P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness 1 is correct) + P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(witness 1 is incorrect)

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller and using witness 1's accuracy:
P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, let's calculate P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller):

P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(witness 1 is correct) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Finally, we can calculate the probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Answer: {probability: 0.41, explanation: The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.}
