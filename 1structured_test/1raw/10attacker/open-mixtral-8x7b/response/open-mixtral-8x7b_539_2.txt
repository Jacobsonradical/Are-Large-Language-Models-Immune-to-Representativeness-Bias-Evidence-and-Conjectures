Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
b) The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.
c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. We need to calculate the probability of this statement being true given the information provided by both witnesses.

To do this, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm and the probability that the second witness is correct when saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker is in this group is 0.85, and thus the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Now, since the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct 80% of the time, we can calculate:

P(attacker 185 cm+ | 1st witness correct) = P(1st witness correct | attacker 185 cm+) * P(attacker 185 cm+)
= (0.8) * (0.15)
= 0.12

Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, we can calculate:

P(attacker < 185 cm | 2nd witness correct) = P(2nd witness correct | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm)
= (0.7) * (0.85)
= 0.595

Since we know both witnesses made a claim, we can calculate the probability that both claims are true by multiplying the probabilities of each claim being true:

P(1st claim true and 2nd claim true) = P(attacker 185 cm+ | 1st witness correct) * P(attacker < 185 cm | 2nd witness correct)
= (0.12) * (0.595)
~ 0.0714

Finally, since we want to know the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct, we can calculate:

P(attacker 185 cm+ and 1st witness correct) = P(attacker 185 cm+ | 1st witness correct) * P(1st witness correct)
= (0.12) * (0.8)
= 0.096

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.096 or 9.6%.
