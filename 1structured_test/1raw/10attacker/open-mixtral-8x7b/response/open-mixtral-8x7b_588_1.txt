Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we want to estimate the probability of being correct.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which would make the first witness incorrect.
5. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm.

Given this information, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct:

P(1st witness correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(1st witness correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know the two probabilities on the right side of the equation:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(1st witness correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Now, calculate P(1st witness correct):
P(1st witness correct) = 0.15 * 0.8
P(1st witness correct) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
