Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, who correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, the probability of them stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are is 0.8 (80%). The probability of them stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%), because of their error rate.

For the second witness, who correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, the probability of them stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are is 0.7 (70%). The probability of them stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.3 (30%), because of their error rate.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to both witnesses' testimony.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E1 and E2 be the events that witness 1 and 2 respectively state that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to calculate P(A|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses stated so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) * P(A) / P(E1, E2)

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15%), P(E1|A) = 0.8 (80%), P(E2|A) = 0.7 (70%). We also need to calculate P(E1, E2), which is the probability of both witnesses stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) * P(A) + P(E1, E2|¬A) * P(¬A)

Calculating the probabilities of both witnesses stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not (¬A):
P(E1|¬A) = 0.2 (20%), P(E2|¬A) = 0.3 (30%).

Now, we can calculate P(E1, E2|¬A):
P(E1, E2|¬A) = P(E1|¬A) * P(E2|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (6%)

Finally, we can calculate P(E1, E2):
P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) * P(A) + P(E1, E2|¬A) * P(¬A) = (0.8 * 0.7) * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 (13.5%)

Now, we can calculate P(A|E1, E2):
P(A|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|A) * P(A) / P(E1, E2) = (0.8 * 0.7) * 0.15 / 0.135 ≈ 0.6496 (64.96%)

Therefore, given the information provided, there is approximately a 64.96% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
