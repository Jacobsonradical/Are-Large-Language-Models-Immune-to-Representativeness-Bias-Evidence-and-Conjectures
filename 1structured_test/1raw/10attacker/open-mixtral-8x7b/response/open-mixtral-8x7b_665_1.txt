To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability of each witness's claim being true, and then weighting them by their accuracy.

From statement (a), we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the height of the attacker as H, where H = 1 if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and H = 0 otherwise.

We want to find P(H=1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From statement (b), we know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time. So, the probability of the first witness's claim being true is:

P(W1_true) = P(H=1) * 0.8 + P(H=0) * 0.2

Similarly, the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time. So, the probability of the second witness's claim being true is:

P(W2_true) = P(H=1) * 0.3 + P(H=0) * 0.7

Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(H=1) = P(H=1 | W1_true) * P(W1_true) + P(H=1 | W2_true) * P(W2_true)

We know that P(W1_true) = 0.8 * P(H=1) + 0.2 * P(H=0) = 0.8 * P(H=1) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H=1))

We also know that P(W2_true) = 0.3 * P(H=1) + 0.7 * (1 - P(H=1))

Substituting these into the law of total probability equation, we get:

P(H=1) = P(H=1 | W1_true) * (0.8 * P(H=1) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H=1))) + P(H=1 | W2_true) * (0.3 * P(H=1) + 0.7 * (1 - P(H=1)))

From statement (b), we know that both witnesses are correct 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 of the time, when the person is 185 cm or taller. So, P(H=1 | W1_true and W2_true) = 1.

Similarly, both witnesses are incorrect 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 of the time, when the person is shorter than 185 cm. So, P(H=0 | W1_true and W2_true) = 1.

Using these facts, we can simplify the equation:

P(H=1) = 1 * (0.8 * P(H=1) + 0.2 * (1 - P(H=1))) + 0 * (0.3 * P(H=1) + 0.7 * (1 - P(H=1)))

Solving this equation, we get:

P(H=1) = 0.6

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.6.
