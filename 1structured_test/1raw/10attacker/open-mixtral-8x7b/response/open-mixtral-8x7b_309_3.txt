Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller, based on the given information.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. 

Now let's consider the population distribution given in (b): 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = P(witness claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 1
