To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A): the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller if the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when judging whether a person is taller than 185 cm, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. According to the city's statistics, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B): the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways: when the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller (event A), and when the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness erroneously claims so. The probability of the second case is P(B|A') * P(A'), where A' is the complementary event of A (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm), P(B|A') is the probability that the witness erroneously claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(A') is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(A') = 0.85. The first witness is wrong 20% of the time when judging whether a person is taller than 185 cm, so P(B|A') = 0.2.

Therefore, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we have all the components to calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
