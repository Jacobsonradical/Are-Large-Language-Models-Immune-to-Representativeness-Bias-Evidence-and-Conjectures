Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on witness 1's claim, we need to find the probability that witness 1 is correct, given their claim.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 made this claim.

To calculate P(A|B), we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B).

P(B|A) is the probability that witness 1 makes the claim, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probability that witness 1 makes the claim, regardless of whether the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller. Since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can write:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.3793103448275862}
