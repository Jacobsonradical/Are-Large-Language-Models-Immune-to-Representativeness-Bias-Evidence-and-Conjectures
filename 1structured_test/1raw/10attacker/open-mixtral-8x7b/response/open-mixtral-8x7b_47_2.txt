Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously claims a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

b) The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously claims a person is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since both witnesses cannot be correct, we need to consider the possibilities:
1. Both witnesses are correct: P(A and B) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2. First witness is correct, second is not: P(A and not B) = 0.15 * 0.20 + 0.85 * 0.30 = 0.255
3. First witness is not correct, second is: P(not A and B) = 0.85 * 0.20 + 0.15 * 0.30 = 0.205
4. Both witnesses are incorrect: P(not A and not B) = 0.85 * 0.80 = 0.68

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is the sum of probabilities 1 and 2:

{probability: 0.12 + 0.255, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.375, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
