Let's break down the given information and make some calculations:

a. We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time (0.8) and wrong 20% of the time (0.2).

b. The second witness is correct 70% of the time (0.7) and wrong 30% of the time (0.3).

c. The population data tells us that 85% of the people in the city are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. However, the first witness's testimony does not provide any additional information if we consider the second witness's testimony as well. Therefore, we need to calculate the combined probability of the two witnesses both being correct or both being incorrect.

- The probability of both witnesses being correct: 0.8 (first witness correct) x 0.7 (second witness correct) ≈ 0.56
- The probability of both witnesses being incorrect: 0.2 (first witness incorrect) x 0.3 (second witness incorrect) ≈ 0.06

Since the witnesses' testimonies are not independent (they disagree), we cannot simply add these probabilities. Instead, we need to consider the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect.

- The probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect: 0.8 (first witness correct) x 0.3 (second witness incorrect) ≈ 0.24

Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

- P(attacker ≥ 185 cm | first witness's claim) ≈ 0.56 (both correct) + 0.24 (first correct, second incorrect) ≈ 0.8

However, this result is questionable because the first witness's testimony does not provide any new information when considering the second witness's testimony. Thus, it is more reasonable to use the prior probability based on the population data:

- P(attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

Given the available information, we cannot confidently update our prior probability based on the witnesses' testimonies. Therefore, I would stick with the prior probability based on the population data:

{probability: 0.15}
