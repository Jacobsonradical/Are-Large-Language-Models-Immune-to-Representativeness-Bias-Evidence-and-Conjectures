Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. So, we will only consider the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim (and incorrect 20% of the time).
5. The population statistics tell us that 15% of the city's population is 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of making the correct statement about the attacker's height (the weighted average of the two witnesses' accuracy).

To find P(B), we can calculate the expected accuracy for each witness and then take the weighted average:

- P(B) for the first witness: 80% * 15% + 20% * 85% = 27.5% + 17% = 44.5%
- P(B) for the second witness: 70% * 15% + 30% * 85% = 10.5% + 25.5% = 36%
- Weighted average P(B): (44.5% * 1/2) + (36% * 1/2) = 40.25%

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.4025 â‰ˆ 0.3624

{probability: 0.3624}
