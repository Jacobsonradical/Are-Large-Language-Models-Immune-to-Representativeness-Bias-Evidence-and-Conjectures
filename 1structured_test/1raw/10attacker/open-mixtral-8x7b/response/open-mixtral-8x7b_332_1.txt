Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
b) The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as taller or shorter than 185 cm.
c) 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. In order to do that, we can calculate the combined probability of the first witness being correct and the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, and divide this by the combined probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 100% * 20% + 80% * 80% = 20% + 64% = 0.84

P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 100% * 80% = 80% = 0.80
P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 100% * 20% = 20% = 0.20

Now we can calculate the combined probability:

P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.15 * 0.80
= 0.12

P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.85 * 0.20
= 0.17

The combined probability is:

P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller and attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41}
