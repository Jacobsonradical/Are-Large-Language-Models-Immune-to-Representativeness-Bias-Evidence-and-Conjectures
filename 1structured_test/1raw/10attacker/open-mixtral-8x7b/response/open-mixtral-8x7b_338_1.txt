Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Let's denote this probability as P(A), where A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the probability of this statement being true. We have two possible scenarios:
1) The first witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2) The first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(A|W1) as follows:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Let's calculate each term in the equation:

P(W1|A): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8.

P(A): The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

P(W1): The overall probability of the first witness's claim, regardless of whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of each scenario:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A')

where A' represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(W1|A') is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time, P(W1|A') = 0.2.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.345.
