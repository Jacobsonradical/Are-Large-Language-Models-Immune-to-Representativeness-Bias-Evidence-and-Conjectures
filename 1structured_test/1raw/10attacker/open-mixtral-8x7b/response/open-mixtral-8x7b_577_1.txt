Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

Given that one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.

The first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller is evidence for the attacker being that tall. However, the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm contradicts this evidence. We need to multiply the likelihood of the first witness's claim by the likelihood of the second witness's claim, given that the first witness's claim is true.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
