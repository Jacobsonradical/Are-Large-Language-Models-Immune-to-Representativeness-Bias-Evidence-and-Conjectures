Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their statement contradicts the first witness.
3. We will calculate the probability of each witness being correct and then combine these probabilities using conditional probability.
4. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time: P(W1T) = 0.8.
5. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time: P(W2S) = 0.7.
6. Since the witnesses' statements contradict each other, either the first witness is correct, and the second is not, or vice versa: P(W1T) * P(W2S') + P(W1T') * P(W2S)
7. We have already determined P(W1T) = 0.8 and P(W2S) = 0.7, so we need to calculate P(W1T') and P(W2S').
8. The complement of P(W1T) is P(W1T') = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, and the complement of P(W2S) is P(W2S') = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.
9. Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement: P(A185cm|W1T) = P(W1T) * P(W2S') + P(W1T') * P(W2S) = (0.8 * 0.3) + (0.2 * 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38.
