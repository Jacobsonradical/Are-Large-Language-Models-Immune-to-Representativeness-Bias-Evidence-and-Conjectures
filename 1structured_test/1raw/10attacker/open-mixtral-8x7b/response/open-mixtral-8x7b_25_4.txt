Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(1st Witness Correct) = 0.8
P(1st Witness Incorrect) = 0.2

P(2nd Witness Correct) = 0.7
P(2nd Witness Incorrect) = 0.3

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller:

P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.85
P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, let's calculate the combined probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Both Correct | Taller) = P(1st Correct) * P(2nd Correct | Taller)
P(Both Correct | Taller) = 0.8 * P(2nd Correct | Taller)

We need to calculate P(2nd Correct | Taller):
- If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the second witness will be correct 70% of the time.

P(Both Correct | Taller) = 0.8 * 0.7
P(Both Correct | Taller) = 0.56

Now, let's calculate the combined probability of both witnesses being incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Both Incorrect | Taller) = P(1st Incorrect) * P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter)
P(Both Incorrect | Taller) = 0.2 * P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter)

We need to calculate P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter):
- If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the second witness will be incorrect 30% of the time.

P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter) = 1 - P(2nd Correct | Shorter)
P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter) = 1 - 0.7
P(2nd Incorrect | Shorter) = 0.3

P(Both Incorrect | Taller) = 0.2 * 0.3
P(Both Incorrect | Taller) = 0.06

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the combined testimony of the two witnesses:

P(Taller | Both Correct) = P(Both Correct | Taller) / P(Both Correct | Taller) + P(Both Incorrect | Taller)
P(Taller | Both Correct) = 0.56 / (0.56 + 0.06)
P(Taller | Both Correct) = 0.56 / 0.62
P(Taller | Both Correct) = 0.903225806451613

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.9032}
