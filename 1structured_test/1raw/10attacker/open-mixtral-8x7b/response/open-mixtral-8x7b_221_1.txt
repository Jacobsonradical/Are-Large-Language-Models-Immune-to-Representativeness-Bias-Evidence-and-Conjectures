Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately:
   - Witness 1: 80% chance of being correct, 20% chance of error
   - Witness 2: 70% chance of being correct, 30% chance of error

b. We know the distribution of the city's population in terms of height:
   - 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (<185 cm)
   - 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (>=185 cm)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Person is 185 cm or taller)

Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, we can use the law of total probability to account for both possible outcomes of the second witness's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Witness 2 is correct | Witness 1 is correct) * P(Person is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Witness 2 is incorrect | Witness 1 is correct) * P(Person is 185 cm or taller)

Using the provided information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

P(Witness 2 is correct | Witness 1 is correct) = 0.7 (both witnesses agree)
P(Witness 2 is incorrect | Witness 1 is correct) = 0.3 (first witness is correct, but the second is not)

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so:

P(Person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * (0.7 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.15)

Calculating the result:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.084 or 8.4%

So, the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim, is 8.4%.

{probability: 0.084}
