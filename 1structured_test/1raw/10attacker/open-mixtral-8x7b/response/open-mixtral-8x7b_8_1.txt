To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This means we'll take into account the statements of both witnesses, along with their error rates.

Let's break down the problem by defining events as follows:
A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: Second witness says attacker is shorter than 1
