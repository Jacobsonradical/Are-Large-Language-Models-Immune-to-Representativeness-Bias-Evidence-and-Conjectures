Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on Witness 1's claim.

First, let's calculate the combined accuracy of both witnesses when they both claim the person is 185 cm or taller:

P(both claim 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

Given that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(both claim 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

We know that:
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (Witness 1's accuracy)
- P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (population statistics)
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.7 (Witness 2's accuracy)

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.7) / 0.8 = 0.7

Now, let's calculate P(both claim 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

This means there is a 56% probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that only one of the witnesses is correct. Let's assume Witness 1 is correct, and calculate the probability that Witness 2 would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness 2 claims 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller and attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Witness 2's accuracy = 0.7

So, there is a 70% chance that Witness 2 would also claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if Witness 1 is correct.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(both claim 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claims shorter) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claims shorter)

We know that:
- P(both claim 185 cm or taller) = 0.56
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claims shorter) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (Witness 1's accuracy and population statistics)
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claims shorter) = 0.5 (assuming equal probability for both heights given conflicting witness statements)

Substituting these values in, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.56 + 0.24 * 0.5 = 0.64

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 64%.
