Let's reason through this:

We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if someone is 185 cm or taller. We also know that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which we don't know, but we can estimate it based on the city's population, which is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims someone is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifies this (0.8 * 0.15), and the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the first witness incorrectly identifies him as 185 cm or taller (0.2 * 0.85). So, P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.2 + 0.17 = 0.37.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.12 or about 12%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
