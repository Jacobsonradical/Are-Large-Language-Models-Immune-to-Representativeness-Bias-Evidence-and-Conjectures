Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which agrees with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which agrees with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given these two conflicting statements from the witnesses, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided about the witnesses' abilities to judge height.

We can calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct as follows:
P(W1Correct) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(W1 identifies correctly) + P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(W1 identifies incorrectly)

We are interested in estimating P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller). We can rearrange the equation to solve for this probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = [P(W1Correct) - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(W1 identifies incorrectly)] / P(W1 identifies correctly)

We have the following probabilities:
- P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
- P(W1 identifies correctly) = 0.8
- P(W1 identifies incorrectly) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

However, we don't have a specific value for P(W1Correct) since we don't know the exact number of attackers in the city. Instead, let's calculate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given the conditions of the witnesses' assessment:

P(W1Correct | Conditions) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(W1 identifies correctly) + P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(W1 identifies incorrectly)
= (0.15) * (0.8) + (0.85) * (0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on Witness 1's claim, as follows:

{probability: 0.12 / 0.29, rounded to two decimal places}

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.41.
