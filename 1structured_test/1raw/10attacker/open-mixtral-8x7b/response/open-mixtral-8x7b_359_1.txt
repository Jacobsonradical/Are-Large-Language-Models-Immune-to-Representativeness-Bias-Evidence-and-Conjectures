Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness:

Witness 1: P(taller) = 0.8 (80% chance of being correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller)
Witness 2: P(taller) = 0.3 (30% chance of being correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to take into account the reliability of each witness and combine their statements. We can do this using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 and W2 represent the statements of the first and second witnesses respectively.

Then, we want to calculate P(A | W1, W2) which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of both witnesses.

According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is P(A).

To apply Bayes' theorem, we also need to calculate P(W1, W2 | A) and P(W1, W2).

P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A)
P(W1 | A) = First witness is correct when person is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(W2 | A) = Second witness is correct when person is 185 cm or taller = 0.3

Therefore, P(W1, W2 | A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, let's calculate P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2 | not A) * P(not A)

We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(not A) = 0.85 and P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W1, W2 | not A), we need to consider the cases where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

For W1: P(W1 | not A) = First witness says the person is 185 cm or taller when they aren't = 0.2 (20% chance of error)
For W2: P(W2 | not A) = Second witness says the person is 185 cm or taller when they aren't = 0.3 (30% chance of error)

So, P(W1, W2 | not A) = P(W1 | not A) * P(W2 | not A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Finally, we can calculate P(W1, W2):

P(W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.06 * 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.051 = 0.087

Now we can calculate P(A | W1, W2):

P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) / P(W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.087 â‰ˆ 0.4367

Given the statements of both witnesses, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4367.
