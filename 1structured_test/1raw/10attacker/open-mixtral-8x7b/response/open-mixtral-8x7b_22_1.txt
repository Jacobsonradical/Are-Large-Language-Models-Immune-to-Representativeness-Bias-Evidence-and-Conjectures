Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A) = Probability of attacker being 185cm or taller AND witness A is correct
= P(attacker is 185cm or taller) * P(witness A is correct)
= 0.15 * 0.8  (since 15% of the population is 185cm or taller and the witness is correct 80% of the time)

Now, let's calculate the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller when they are not:

P(B) = Probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm AND witness A claims 185cm or taller
= P(attacker is shorter than 185cm) * P(witness A claims 185cm or taller)
= 0.85 * 0.2  (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm and the witness errs 20% of the time)

The total probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height to be 185cm or taller is P(A) + P(B):

Probability = 0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.29}
