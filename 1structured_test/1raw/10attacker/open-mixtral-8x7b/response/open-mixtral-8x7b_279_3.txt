Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem. Let's define A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and B as the event that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of people are 185 cm or taller in the city)
P(B|A) = 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 (both witnesses are correct)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 (first witness is incorrect, and the second witness is correct)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of people are shorter than 185 cm in the city)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.64 * 0.15) / ((0.64 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4776

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4776 or 47.76%.
