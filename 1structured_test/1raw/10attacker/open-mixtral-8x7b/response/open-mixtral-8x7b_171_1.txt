Let's break down the information provided and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's testimony.

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person of the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We can calculate the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if they were actually shorter than 185 cm. Since they err 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

Now, to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Where in this case:
- A is the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- not A is the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm
- B is the event that the first witness claimed that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

Plugging in the numbers:

P(A) = 0.15
P(not A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 1 (since the first witness is always correct when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is:

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.4286 or 42.86%

{probability: 0.4286}
