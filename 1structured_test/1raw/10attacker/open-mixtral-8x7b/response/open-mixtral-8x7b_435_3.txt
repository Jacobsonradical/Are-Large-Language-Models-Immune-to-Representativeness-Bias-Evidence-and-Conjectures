Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time, and the other witness correctly identifies the incorrect height (shorter than 185 cm) 70% of the time.
2. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both witnesses' testimonies.
4. The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification 80% of the time.
5. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 1
