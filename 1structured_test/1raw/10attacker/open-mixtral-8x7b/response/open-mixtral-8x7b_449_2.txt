Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker being in the taller group.
3. However, Witness 1 is only correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
4. So, even though the attacker being 185 cm or taller is a possibility, we also need to account for the error rate of Witness 1.

Let's calculate the probability:

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 represent the event that Witness 1 is correct.

We want P(A | W1) = P(Witness 1 is correct AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 is correct)
= P(W1 ∩ A) / P(W1)

From the problem statement, P(W1) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15.
To find P(W1 ∩ A), we use the formula for conditional probability: P(W1 ∩ A) = P(A) * P(W1 | A)

We don't have a direct number for P(W1 | A), but we can find it using the complementary probability:
P(W1 | A) = 1 - P(W1' | A)

We know that when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's a 20% chance that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the height. So P(W1' | A) = 0.2.
Therefore, P(W1 | A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

Now, we can calculate P(W1 ∩ A):
P(W1 ∩ A) = P(A) * P(W1 | A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Finally, we calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so:
P(A | W1) = P(W1 ∩ A) / P(W1) = 0.12 / 0.8 = 0.15

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
