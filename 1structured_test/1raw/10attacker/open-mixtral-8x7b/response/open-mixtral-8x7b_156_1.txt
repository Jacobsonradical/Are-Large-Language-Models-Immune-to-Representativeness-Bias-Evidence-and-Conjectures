Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us at this point.
3. According to the first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. To calculate the probability, we need to find the probability of the witness being correct and multiply it by the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
   - Prior probability: 15% (from point a in the question)
   - Probability of the witness being correct: 80% (given in the question)
5. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement can be calculated as:
   P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's statement) = P(first witness's statement | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   = 0.8 * 0.15
   = 0.12

{probability: 0.12}
