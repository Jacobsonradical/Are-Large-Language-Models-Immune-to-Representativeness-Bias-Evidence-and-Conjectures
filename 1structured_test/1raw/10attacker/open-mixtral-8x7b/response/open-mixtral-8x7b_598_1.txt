Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Given that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).

However, we also need to consider the second witness's statement. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we need to account for the possibility that the second witness is correct and the first witness is mistaken.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (or 85%). However, we know that the first witness is only correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we need to adjust our estimate of the first witness's accuracy to account for the base rate of people who are actually 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the adjusted probability that the first witness is correct:

P(185 cm | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | 185 cm) \* P(185 cm) / P(Witness 1)

P(Witness 1 | 185 cm) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

P(185 cm) is the base rate probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.

P(Witness 1) is the overall probability that the first witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is a weighted average of the first witness's accuracy when identifying someone who is actually 185 cm or taller (0.8) and the first witness's accuracy when identifying someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17). Therefore, P(Witness 1) is 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.255.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(185 cm | Witness 1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.47 (or 47%).
