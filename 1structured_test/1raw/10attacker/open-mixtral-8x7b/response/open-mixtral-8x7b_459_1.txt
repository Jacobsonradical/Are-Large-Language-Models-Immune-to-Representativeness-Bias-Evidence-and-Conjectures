Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we will consider two scenarios:

1) The first witness is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2) The first witness is not correct, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given the first witness's ability to correctly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Given the second witness's ability to correctly identify a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.

Taking into account the population distribution, the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.

Now, we can calculate the probability that the first witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, while also considering the probability that the second witness is not correct and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is correct) * P(First witness is correct)
+ P(Attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm | Second witness is not correct) * P(Second witness is not correct)

= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.255
= 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.375}.
