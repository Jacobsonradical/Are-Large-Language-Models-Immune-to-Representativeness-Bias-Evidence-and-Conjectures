Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 corr) = Probability that the first witness is correct = 0.8
P(W2 corr) = Probability that the second witness is correct = 0.7

Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and 15% of the population falls into this category, we have:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(A') = Probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

Given that the first witness is correct, the attacker must be 185 cm or taller. Hence:

P(A|W1 corr) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness is correct = 1

Similarly, given that the second witness is correct, the attacker must be 185 cm or taller. Hence:

P(A|W2 corr) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the second witness is correct = 0.35 (which is 1 - 0.65 or 100% - 65% that the second witness says is taller than 185 cm)

Now, we calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct and the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr ∧ A) = P(W1 corr) x P(W2 corr) x P(A) = 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.15 ≈ 0.07

Next, we calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct and the attacker not being 185 cm or taller:

P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr ∧ A') = P(W1 corr) x P(W2 corr) x P(A') = 0.8 x 0.7 x 0.85 ≈ 0.442

Now, we calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, regardless of the attacker's height:

P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr) = P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr ∧ A) + P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr ∧ A') ≈ 0.07 + 0.442 ≈ 0.512

Finally, we get the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses are correct:

P(A|W1 corr ∧ W2 corr) = P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr ∧ A) / P(W1 corr ∧ W2 corr) ≈ 0.07 / 0.512 ≈ 0.1365

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1365}
