Let's break down the information given:

1. City statistics: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness reliability: Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on witness 1's claim:

a) The probability of witness 1 being correct when estimating a person as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from the given information).
b) The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the city statistics is 0.15.

We want to find the probability of both events happening. We can calculate this by multiplying the probabilities:

P(185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = P(185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 1 correct)
P(185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = 0.15 * 0.8
P(185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
