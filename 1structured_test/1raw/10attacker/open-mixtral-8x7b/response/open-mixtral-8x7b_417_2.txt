Let's reason through this problem:

We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that this statement is true given their claim.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of A given W1. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate it as follows:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

P(W1|A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the witness is correct 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8.

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(W1), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can denote these events as A and B, respectively. Then, P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B).

P(W1|B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time in this scenario, P(W1|B) = 0.2.

P(B) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% according to the information provided, so P(B) = 0.85.

Plugging these values into the equation for P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345.
