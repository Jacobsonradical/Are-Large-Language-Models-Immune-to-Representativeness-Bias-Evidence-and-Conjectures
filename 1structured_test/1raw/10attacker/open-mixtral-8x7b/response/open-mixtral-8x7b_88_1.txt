Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.

2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but we know they err 20% of the time. So, when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, it means that 80% of the time they're correct and 20% of the time they're not.

3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but we know they err 30% of the time. So, when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 70% of the time they're correct and 30% of the time they're not.

4. Since both witnesses have made contradictory statements, we have to consider the possibility that each witness could be wrong.

5. If the first witness is wrong, then the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct. This event has a probability of 20% (first witness's error rate).

6. If the second witness is wrong, then the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct. This event has a probability of 30% (second witness's error rate).

7. Since the second witness's error rate is higher than the first's, it's more likely that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The final answer is: {probability: 0.35, or 35%}. This is calculated as the product of the prior probability (0.15) and the first witness's accuracy (0.8), plus the product of the second witness's error rate (0.3) and the prior probability (0.15).
