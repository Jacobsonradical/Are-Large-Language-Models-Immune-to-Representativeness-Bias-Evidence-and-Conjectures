Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement:

To do this, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller AND the first witness making a correct estimation.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(Witness 1 correct) = 80% = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims so) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Witness 1 correct)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
