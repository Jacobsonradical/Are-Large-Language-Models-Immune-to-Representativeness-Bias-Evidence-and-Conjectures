Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem.
3. Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
4. In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
5. P(A) is the probability that a random attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 based on the city's population data.
6. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a 185 cm or taller person, which is 80% or 0.8.
7. P(B) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is what we're trying to find. 
8. To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
9. P(B and A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies them as such: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
10. P(B and not A) is the probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller: (1 - 0.15) * (1 - 0.8) * 0.2 = 0.036
11. So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.036 = 0.156
12. Now we can calculate P(A|B): P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.156 â‰ˆ 0.771

{probability: 0.771}
