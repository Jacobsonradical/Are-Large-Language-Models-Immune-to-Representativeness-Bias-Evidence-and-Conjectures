Let's analyze the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.
b. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and is wrong 30% of the time.
c. 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. To do this, we need to calculate the probability of the first witness being correct in their claim and multiply it by the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller.

First, let's find the probability of the first witness being correct:
- If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the first witness will be correct.
- If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the first witness will be wrong.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability of the first witness being correct is 15% + 7.5% (half of the cases where the second witness is incorrect) = 22.5%.

Thus, the final estimate is:
{probability: 0.225}
