Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. Since the witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability of the attacker being in this category given the witness's statement.
4. Let's compute the probability of the witness being correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and being incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
5. The witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which has a probability of 15% (from population distribution).
6. The witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which has a probability of 85% (from population distribution).
7. Given the witness's accuracy, the probability of them being correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of them being incorrect is 0.2 (20%).
8. Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.
9. Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B is the event of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
10. The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they actually are (P(B|A)) is 15% (from population distribution).
11. The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(A)) is 15% (from population distribution).
12. The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(B)) is: P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A).
13. The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not (P(B|not A)) is the probability of the witness's error, which is 20% (from witness accuracy).
14. Plugging in the numbers, we get: P(B) = (0.15)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.0225 + 0.17 = 0.1925.
15. Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = (0.15)(0.15) / (0.1925) â‰ˆ 0.1247 (12.47%).
