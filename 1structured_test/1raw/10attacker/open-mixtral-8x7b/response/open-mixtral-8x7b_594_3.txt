Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(1st correct) = 0.80
P(2nd correct) = 0.70

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the first witness being correct by chance is:

P(1st correct | attacker < 185 cm) = 0.15 (100% - 85%)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(attacker >= 185 cm | 1st correct) = P(1st correct | attacker >= 185 cm) * P(attacker >= 185 cm) / P(1st correct)

Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the second witness's claim:

P(attacker < 185 cm | 2nd correct) = P(2nd correct | attacker < 185 cm) * P(attacker < 185 cm) / P(2nd correct)

Now, since either the attacker is taller or shorter than 185 cm, but not both, we can combine these probabilities to get the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker >= 185 cm) = P(attacker >= 185 cm | 1st correct) * P(1st correct) + P(attacker >= 185 cm | 2nd correct) * P(2nd correct)

Given the information, the probability is:

P(attacker >= 185 cm) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.70 * 0.85)) = 0.18 â‰ˆ 18%

{probability: 0.18}
