Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know from the population statistics is correct 15% of the time.
3. However, since the attack happened at night, the witness's ability to judge height is important. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when given a sample of people with equal numbers of those under and over 185 cm.
4. So, we need to adjust our initial 15% by the witness's accuracy rate. Therefore, the final estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, would be 15% * 80% = 12%.

So, {probability: 0.12}. This means there's a 12% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim and considering the conditions.
