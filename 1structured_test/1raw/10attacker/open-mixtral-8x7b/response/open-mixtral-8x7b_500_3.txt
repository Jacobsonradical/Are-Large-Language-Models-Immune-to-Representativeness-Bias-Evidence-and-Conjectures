Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since both witnesses' claims cannot be true at the same time, we cannot simply use their statements to estimate the probability. Instead, let's consider the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. If this statement is true, then the first witness's claim about the attacker being 185 cm or taller is certainly false.

Given the population distribution (b), we know that the second witness's claim is more likely, as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate the probability of the second witness being correct as:

P(Correct second witness) = P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we can find the probability of the first witness being correct, given that the second witness is correct (which means the first witness is incorrect), using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct second witness) = P(Correct first witness | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Correct second witness)

We know P(Correct second witness) = 0.85, and the prior P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be inferred from the population distribution:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

The first witness's correct identification rate is 80%, but that's only when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since we now have a different prior, we need to adjust the first witness's correct identification rate. We can do this by dividing the first witness's correct identification rate by the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

Adjusted P(Correct first witness | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Correct first witness) / P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 / 0.15 ≈ 5.33

However, this value is greater than 1, which indicates an error in our calculations or reasoning. Since the first witness's correct identification rate is not conditioned on the true height of the attacker, we cannot simply adjust it using the prior probability. Instead, we should consider the first witness's error rate of 20%.

Let E represent the event that the first witness is in error. Then, P(E) = 0.20.

Now, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct, given that the second witness is correct, as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct second witness) = 1 - P(E | Correct second witness)

To find P(E | Correct second witness), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(E | Correct second witness) = P(Correct second witness | E) * P(E) / P(Correct second witness)

We already know P(Correct second witness) = 0.85, P(E) = 0.20, and we know that P(Correct second witness | E) is the second witness's error rate, which is 0.30 (30%).

Substituting these values, we have:

P(E | Correct second witness) = 0.30 * 0.20 / 0.85 ≈ 0.0694

Now, we can find the final probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Correct second witness) = 1 - P(E | Correct second witness) = 1 - 0.0694 ≈ 0.9306

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given the information provided and assuming the second witness is correct, is approximately 0.9306 or 93.06%.
