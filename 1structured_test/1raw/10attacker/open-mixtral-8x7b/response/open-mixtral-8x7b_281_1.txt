Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating height.

To calculate this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, A represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the first witness said the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From the problem statement, we know that:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8, as stated in the problem.
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From part (b) of the problem statement, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the witness is correct (i.e., the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller) and the probability that the witness is incorrect (i.e., the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness says it's 185 cm or taller).

The probability that the witness is correct is 0.8 (from part A) times 0.15 (from part B), which equals 0.12.

The probability that the witness is incorrect is 0.2 (from part A) times 0.85 (from part B), which equals 0.17.

Therefore, P(B) is the sum of these two probabilities, or 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
