Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate when guessing. So, when the true height is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they'll guess correctly.
3. However, the first witness could also be wrong, and since they have a 20% error rate when the true height is shorter than 185 cm, there's also a 20% chance they'll mistakenly claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate. This means if the attacker was indeed shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance the second witness would correctly identify the height.
5. But, there's a 30% chance that the second witness would mistakenly claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they're actually 185 cm or taller.

Given these conditions, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness incorrect)
= (0.8) * (0.3)
= 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24 or 24%.
