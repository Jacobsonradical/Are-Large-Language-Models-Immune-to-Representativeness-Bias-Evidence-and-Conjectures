Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claims so. This is the probability of witness 1 being correct, which is 0.8.

So, {probability: 0.8}
