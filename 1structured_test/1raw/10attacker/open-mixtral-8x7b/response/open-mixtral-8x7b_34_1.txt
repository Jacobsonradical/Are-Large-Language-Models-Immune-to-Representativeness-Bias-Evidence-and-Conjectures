Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making height judgments.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when making height judgments.
4. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
5. However, we don't have any direct information about how often both witnesses are correct or incorrect simultaneously.
6. Given the information provided, it seems most reasonable to rely on the first witness's claim about the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, since this witness has a higher accuracy rate (0.8) compared to the second witness (0.7).
7. But without more information about how often these two witnesses agree or disagree, we cannot provide a more precise estimate.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can only give a conservative estimate:
{probability: 0.8, explanation: This is the accuracy rate of the first witness when judging a person's height to be 185 cm or taller.}
