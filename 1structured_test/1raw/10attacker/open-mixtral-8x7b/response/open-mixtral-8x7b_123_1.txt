Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 30% of the time.
4. Since the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and we know the first witness said the opposite, we want to find the probability that the first witness is correct.
5. The probability that both witnesses are correct is 0.8 (first witness's accuracy) * 0.7 (second witness's accuracy when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.56.
6. The probability that both witnesses are incorrect is 0.2 (first witness's error rate) * 0.3 (second witness's error rate when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.06.
7. The probability that the first witness is correct, given that one of them must be correct, is 0.56 / (0.56 + 0.06) = 0.90.

So, our estimate is {probability: 0.90}.
