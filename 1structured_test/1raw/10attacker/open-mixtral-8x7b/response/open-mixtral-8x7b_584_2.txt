To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both witnesses and the population statistics. 

First, let's calculate the weighted average of the first witness's accuracy:
Weighted average = (0.5 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.6

This means that when the first witness claims a person is 185 cm or taller, there's a 0.6 probability that they are correct.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the first witness's accuracy for this specific scenario:
P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so:
P(attacker is 185+ cm | witness says 185+ cm) = P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) * P(attacker is 185+ cm) / P(witness says 185+ cm)

We know P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8, and from the population statistics, P(attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15.

To calculate P(witness says 185+ cm), we can use the law of total probability:
P(witness says 185+ cm) = P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) * P(attacker is 185+ cm) + P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is NOT 185+ cm) * P(attacker is NOT 185+ cm)

We know P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8 and P(attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15, and also P(witness says 185+ cm | attacker is NOT 185+ cm) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the second witness's error rate). We also know that P(attacker is NOT 185+ cm) = 1 - P(attacker is 185+ cm) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

So, P(witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.24 + 0.255 = 0.495

Now, we can calculate the final probability:
P(attacker is 185+ cm | witness says 185+ cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.495) = 0.096

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.096 or 9.6%.
