Let's reason through this:

We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if someone is 185cm or taller. Given that the population distribution is such that 85% of people are shorter than 185cm, it means that a person of height 185cm or taller is a relatively rare occurrence.

The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, sometimes makes mistakes and identifies someone as being 185cm or taller even when they're not. This could potentially bias their estimates towards the "taller" category, since they're more likely to see tall people than very short people.

However, the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, contradicts the first witness. This reduces our confidence in the claim made by the first witness.

Given these two pieces of information, it seems unlikely that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller, despite the first witness's claim. But we can't rule it out completely, given the first witness's relative accuracy.

To compute a numerical estimate, we would need to create a detailed model taking into account the error rates of both witnesses, the population distribution, and the fact that the two witnesses disagreed. This is beyond the scope of a simple text response, but intuitively, I would estimate the probability as being quite a bit lower than 50%.

{probability: 0.35, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This estimate is highly dependent on the specifics of how the witnesses' error rates translate to this particular scenario, and should be taken as a rough approximation rather than a precise calculation.
