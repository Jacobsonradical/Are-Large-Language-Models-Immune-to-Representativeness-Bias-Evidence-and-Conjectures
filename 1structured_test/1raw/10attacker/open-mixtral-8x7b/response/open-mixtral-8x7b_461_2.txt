Let's analyze the given information:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller," and B is the event "the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller."

We're given P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy in identifying taller people)

We're given P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion of people 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = (0.8 * 0.15) + (P(B|not A) * 0.85)

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(A and B) = P(B|A) * P(A)
           = (0.8 * 0.15)
           = 0.12

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller:

P(not A and B) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)
               = 0.2 * 0.85
               = 0.17

Now, we can calculate P(B) using the probabilities above:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, based on the given information, is approximately 0.4138.
