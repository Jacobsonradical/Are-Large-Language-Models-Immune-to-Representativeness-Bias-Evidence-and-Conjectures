Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We are given P(B|A), which is the accuracy of the first witness, or 0.8. We are also given P(A), which is the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, or 0.15 (15%).

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: the first witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (P(B|A) * P(A)), and the first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(B|A') * P(A')).

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
