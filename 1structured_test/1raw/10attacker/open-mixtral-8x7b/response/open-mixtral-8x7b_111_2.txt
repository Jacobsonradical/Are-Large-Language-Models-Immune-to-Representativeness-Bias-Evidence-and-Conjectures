To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given information about two witnesses and the general population's heights in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- B as the event "the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- C as the event "the second witness claimed the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm"

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From the given, we have the following probabilities:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identified the height as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identified the height as 185 cm or taller with 20% accuracy)
P(C|¬A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identified the height as shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy)

To find P(¬A), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we calculate:
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now, we have:
P(C|¬A) = 0.70

We need to find P(¬B|C) as well, which is the probability of the first witness not claiming the height was 185 cm or taller given that the second witness claimed the height was shorter. Since the two witnesses have independent observations, P(¬B|C) = P(¬B):

P(¬B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(¬B) = 1 - ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(¬B) = 1 - 0.285
P(¬B) = 0.715

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.715))
P(A|B) ≈ 0.376

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.376.
