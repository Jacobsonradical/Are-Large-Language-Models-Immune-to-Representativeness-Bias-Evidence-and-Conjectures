To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote:

A: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

We are given:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

First, compute P(B|not A):
P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B'|not A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we can compute P(B|not A) * P(not A):
P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255

Now, we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.255)] = 0.378378 or approximately 0.3784

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3784.
