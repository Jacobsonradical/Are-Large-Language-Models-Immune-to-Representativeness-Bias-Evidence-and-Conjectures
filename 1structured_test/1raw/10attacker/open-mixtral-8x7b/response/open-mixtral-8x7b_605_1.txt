Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80% when making such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70% when making such a claim.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 made this claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 made this claim.

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy when claiming someone is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(B), we need to consider the two possible cases for the attacker's height (shorter or taller than 185 cm) and the accuracy of the two witnesses in each case:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Here, A' represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(A') = 0.85 (the prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm).

We also know that:
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (witness 1's error rate when claiming someone is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
