Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (according to the court's assessment).
4. However, we don't know the actual height of the attacker, so we cannot use this probability directly.
5. Instead, we can use the given information about the city's population: 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
6. Thus, the probability that the first witness is correct in their statement (attacker is 185 cm or taller) is equal to the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Here is the answer in the requested format:

{probability: 0.15}
