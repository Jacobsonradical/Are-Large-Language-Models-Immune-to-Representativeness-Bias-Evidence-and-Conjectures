To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two witnesses and the population statistics.

Witness 1:

* Correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time
* Erroneously claims a person is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time

Witness 2:

* Correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time
* Erroneously claims a person is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time

Population:

* 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
* 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller

Let's assume both witnesses made their statements independently. We can calculate the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm (using the complementary probability):

P(both claim 185 cm or taller | actually shorter) = P(W1 claims 185 cm or taller) * P(W2 claims 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 \* 0.3
= 0.06 (or 6%)

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that both witnesses claim so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(actually 185 cm or taller | both claim 185 cm or taller) = P(both claim 185 cm or taller | actually 185 cm or taller) * P(actually 185 cm or taller) / P(both claim 185 cm or taller)
= 1 \* 0.15 / (1 \* 0.15 + 0.06)
= 0.714 (or 71.4%)

So, given the two witnesses' testimonies, there is a 71.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
