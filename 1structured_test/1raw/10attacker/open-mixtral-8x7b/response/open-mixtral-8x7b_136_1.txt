Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.80
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.70

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Now we can calculate the probabilities of both witnesses being correct, assuming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(1st witness correct & attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(1st witness correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12

P(2nd witness correct & attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(2nd witness correct) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.70 * 0.85 = 0.595

Now, let's calculate the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and both witnesses being correct:

P(1st witness claims 185 cm or taller & both are correct) = P(1st witness correct & attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(2nd witness correct & attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.12 * 0.595 ≈ 0.0714

Finally, let's calculate the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses are correct:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both are correct) = P(1st witness claims 185 cm or taller & both are correct) / P(2nd witness correct & attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.0714 / 0.595 ≈ 0.1201

So, based on the available information, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.1201.
