Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, we can calculate the probability of a random person being 185cm or taller:

P(Person is 185cm or taller) = 1 - P(Person is shorter than 185cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Since the two witnesses have contradictory statements, only one of them can be correct. Therefore, the probability of the first witness being correct and the second being incorrect is:

P(1st correct & 2nd incorrect) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect)
P(1st correct & 2nd incorrect) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, to answer the question, we want the probability that the attacker is indeed 185cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claim) = P(1st correct & 2nd incorrect) / P(Any correct statement)

To calculate P(Any correct statement), we can sum up the probabilities of all combinations of one correct witness and one incorrect witness:

P(Any correct statement) = P(1st correct & 2nd incorrect) + P(1st incorrect & 2nd correct)
P(Any correct statement) = 0.24 + (1 - 0.8) * 0.7 = 0.24 + 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38

Now, we can calculate the desired probability:

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claim) = P(1st correct & 2nd incorrect) / P(Any correct statement)
P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claim) = 0.24 / 0.38 â‰ˆ 0.6316

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.6316}
