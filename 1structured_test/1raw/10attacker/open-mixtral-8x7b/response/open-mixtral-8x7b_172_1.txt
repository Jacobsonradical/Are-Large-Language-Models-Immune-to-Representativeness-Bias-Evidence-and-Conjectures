Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and witness 2 correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time.

b) We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given the witnesses' testimonies, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since both witnesses' claims cannot be true at the same time, we will calculate the probability for each claim and then weigh them according to their reliability.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy)
P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller | witness 1) = 0.2 (witness 1's error rate)

P(attacker is not 185 cm or taller | witness 2) = 0.7 (witness 2's accuracy)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2) = 0.3 (witness 2's error rate)

To weigh these probabilities, we can use the base rates from the city's population:

P(witness 1's claim) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(witness 2's claim) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the final estimate:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness 1's claim) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1) + P(witness 2's claim) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2)

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.3) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is {probability: 0.375}.
