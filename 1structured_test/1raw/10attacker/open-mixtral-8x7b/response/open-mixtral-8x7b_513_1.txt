Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(1st Witness Correct) = 0.8
P(1st Witness Incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(2nd Witness Correct) = 0.7
P(2nd Witness Incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now, let's find the probability that both witnesses are correct when the first witness claims the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller:

P(Both Correct | Height 185+) = P(1st Correct) * P(2nd Correct | 1st Correct)

To find P(2nd Correct | 1st Correct), we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(2nd Correct | 1st Correct) = P(1st Correct | 2nd Correct) * P(2nd Correct) / P(1st Correct)

We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so:
P(1st Correct) = 0.15 (since the first witness is correct when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(2nd Correct) = 0.85 (since the second witness is correct when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(1st Correct | 2nd Correct):

P(1st Correct | 2nd Correct) = P(2nd Correct | 1st Correct) * P(1st Correct) / P(2nd Correct)
P(1st Correct | 2nd Correct) = 0.8 (from the first witness's accuracy) * 0.15 / 0.85 = 0.1353 (approximately)

Finally, we can calculate P(Both Correct | Height 185+):

P(Both Correct | Height 185+) = P(1st Correct) * P(2nd Correct | 1st Correct)
P(Both Correct | Height 185+) = 0.8 * 0.1353 = 0.1082 (approximately)

Now, we need to find the probability that both witnesses are correct given the total population:

P(Both Correct) = P(Both Correct | Height 185+) * P(Height 185+) + P(Both Correct | Height < 185) * P(Height < 185)

We know P(Height 185+) = 0.15 and P(Height < 185) = 0.85. However, we don't have the exact accuracy for both witnesses when the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. Thus, we cannot directly calculate P(Both Correct | Height < 185).

However, if we assume that the witnesses' performances are independent of each other, then:

P(Both Correct) = P(Both Correct | Height 185+) * P(Height 185+) + P(1st Correct) * P(2nd Correct) * P(Height < 185)

= 0.1082 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.4918 (approximately)

So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses are correct, is:

P(Height 185+ | Both Correct) = P(Both Correct | Height 185+) * P(Height 185+) / P(Both Correct)

= 0.1082 * 0.15 / 0.4918 = 0.0318 (approximately)

However, this answer is based on the assumption that the witnesses' performances are independent of the attacker's actual height, which might not be the case in a real-world scenario.
