Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when making height judgments. 

To calculate the probability, we need to consider both the accuracy of the witness and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population.

Let's denote:
- P(T) as the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller
- P(T') as the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W|T) as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller
- P(W'|T') as the probability that the witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm

From the data provided:
- P(T) = 0.15
- P(T') = 0.85
- P(W|T) = 0.8
- P(W'|T') = 0.7

Now, we want to find P(T|W), the probability that a person is 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W) = [ P(W|T) * P(T) ] / P(W)

We need to find P(W), the probability of the witness identifying a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(W) = P(W|T) * P(T) + P(W|T') * P(T')

Now, we can find P(T|W):

P(T|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [ (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) ]
       = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
       = 0.12 / 0.29
       = 0.4137931 (rounded to 9 decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

{probability: 0.414}
