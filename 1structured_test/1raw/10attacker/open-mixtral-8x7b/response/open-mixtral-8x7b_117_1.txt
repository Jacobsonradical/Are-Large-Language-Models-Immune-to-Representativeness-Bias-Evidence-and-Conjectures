Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. This means we need to calculate the probability that both witnesses gave the same answer (both claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller), and then weigh this probability by the likelihood that the first witness is correct.

First, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, the probability that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.7. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that they also claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56.

Now, we need to weigh this probability by the likelihood that the first witness is correct. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is also 0.15. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.56 * 0.15 = 0.084, or 8.4%.
