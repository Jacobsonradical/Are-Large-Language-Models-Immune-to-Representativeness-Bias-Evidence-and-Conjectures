Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8

Now, let's calculate the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller:

15% of the population is 185cm or taller, so the second witness will claim so 30% of the time when the attacker is actually in this category (since they're only correct 70% of the time). So, the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller is:
0.3 * 0.15 + 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.765 (when the attacker's actual height is 185cm or taller)

However, if the attacker is not 185cm or taller, the second witness will claim so 30% of the time, which is 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255 of the total population.

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claims) = [P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness claims | attacker is 185cm or taller)] / P(2nd witness claims)

We have calculated all the values needed:

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness claims | attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.765
P(2nd witness claims) = 0.765 * 0.5 + 0.255 = 0.53

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claims) = (0.8 * 0.765) / 0.53 â‰ˆ 1.17

However, probability cannot be greater than 1. This means that the first witness's claim alone does not provide enough information to reliably estimate the attacker's height. We can only say that, based on the information provided, the attacker is more likely to be 185cm or taller, but we cannot quantify this probability accurately.
