Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Since we have two conflicting statements from the witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our initial belief based on the more reliable witness.
3. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E as the evidence from the witnesses.
4. We want to calculate P(A|E), the probability of A given the evidence from both witnesses.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
   P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)
6. We're given P(E|A), the accuracy of the first witness, as 80%.
7. We're also given P(A), the prior probability based on the city's population, which is 15% (0.15).
8. To calculate P(E), we need to consider two scenarios: E1, where the first witness is correct, and E2, where the first witness is incorrect.
9. P(E1) = P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.245
10. P(E2) = P(E2|A) * P(A) + P(E2|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.2 * 0.15 + 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.755
11. Since either E1 or E2 must occur, P(E) = P(E1) + P(E2) = 1
12. Now we can calculate P(A|E):
    P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 1 = 0.12

The answer is: {probability: 0.12}
