Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness accurately identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness accurately identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

Given these conditions, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.8, or 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
