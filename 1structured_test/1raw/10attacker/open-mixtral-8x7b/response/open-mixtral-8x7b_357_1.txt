Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which falls in the 15% category.
3. However, Witness 1 is only correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller.
4. So, when Witness 1 says a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right and a 20% chance they're wrong.
5. Given that Witness 1 is only right 80% of the time, we multiply the height category's percentage (15%) by Witness 1's accuracy (80%): 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 12%.
