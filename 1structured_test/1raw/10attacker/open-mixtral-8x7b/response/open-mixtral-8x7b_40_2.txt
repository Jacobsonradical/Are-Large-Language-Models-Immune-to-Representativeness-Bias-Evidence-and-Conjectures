Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1's claim)

We are given:
- P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct with 80% probability)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm), we need to consider the probability that Witness 1 makes an error and claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with 70% accuracy, Witness 1 must be incorrect 30% of the time:

P(Witness 1's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.3 (witness 1 is incorrect with 30% probability)

Now, we can calculate P(Witness 1's claim):

P(Witness 1's claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

{probability: 0.32}
