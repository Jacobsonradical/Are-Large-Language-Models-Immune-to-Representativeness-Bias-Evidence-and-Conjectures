Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height:
- Witness 1: 80% correct, 20% error
- Witness 2: 70% correct, 30% error

b) We also know the distribution of heights in the city's population:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should consider both pieces of information. The first witness states that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their success rate is 80%. The second witness states that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their success rate is 70%.

Given these success rates, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 incorrect) + 0.5 * P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 correct)

We multiply the probability of Witness 1 being correct by the probability of Witness 2 being incorrect because if Witness 1 is correct, then Witness 2 must be incorrect. However, since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we might have a case where both witnesses are correct (the attacker is exactly 185 cm). Since we don't know the exact height from both witnesses, we assume there is a 50% chance that the attacker's height is exactly 185 cm if both witnesses are correct.

Now, we calculate the probabilities:

P(Witness 1 correct) = 0.8
P(Witness 2 incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
P(Witness 2 correct) = 0.7

Plugging these values into the equation:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.3) + (0.5 * 0.8 * 0.7) = 0.24 + 0.28 = 0.52

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 52%.

{probability: 0.52}
