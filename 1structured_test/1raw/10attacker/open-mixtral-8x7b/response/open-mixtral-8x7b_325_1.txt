Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, which we know is 80%. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 

We need to calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that the person is truly 185 cm or taller. This is the same as 80%, or 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are actually not that tall. This is the complement of the first witness correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, which is 20%. So, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 1
