Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct or incorrect:

P(W1Correct) = 0.8
P(W1Incorrect) = 1 - P(W1Correct) = 0.2

P(W2Correct) = 0.7
P(W2Incorrect) = 1 - P(W2Correct) = 0.3

Since the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we're interested in the probability of both of these events being correct or one being correct and the other being incorrect.

Let's define E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(E|W1Correct & W2Incorrect) = P(E) = 0.15 (from part b)
P(E^C|W1Correct & W2Incorrect) = P(E^C) = 0.85 (from part b)

P(E|W1Incorrect & W2Correct) = P(W2Correct|E) * P(W1Incorrect) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06
P(E^C|W1Incorrect & W2Correct) = P(W2Correct|E^C) * P(W1Incorrect) = 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14

P(E|W1Correct & W2Incorrect) > P(E|W1Incorrect & W2Correct)

Now, to find the total probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies, we need to consider the combined probabilities:

P(E|W1Correct, W2Incorrect) * P(W1Correct) * P(W2Incorrect) + P(E|W1Incorrect, W2Correct) * P(W1Incorrect) * P(W2Correct)

Plugging in the values:
(0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3) + (0.06 * 0.2 * 0.7) = 0.036 + 0.0084 = 0.0444

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.0444}
