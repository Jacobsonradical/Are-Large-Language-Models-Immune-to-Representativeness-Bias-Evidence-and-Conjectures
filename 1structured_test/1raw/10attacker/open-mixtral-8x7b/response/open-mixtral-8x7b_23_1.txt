Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there are two possibilities:
1. The first witness is correct, and the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 1
