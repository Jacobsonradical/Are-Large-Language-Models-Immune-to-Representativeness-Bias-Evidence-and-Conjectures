To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability and consider the probabilities given for each witness's statements.

Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

From witness 1, the probability of observing the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller (A), is 0.8. Similarly, the probability of observing the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm (Â¬A), is 0.2.
