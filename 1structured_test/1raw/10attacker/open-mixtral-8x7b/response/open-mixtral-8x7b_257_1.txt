Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification in 80% of cases.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which also aligns with their correct identification in 70% of cases.
4. Since both witnesses' testimonies contradict each other, we cannot use the combination of their testimonies directly.
5. However, we can still use the reliability of each individual testimony to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
6. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a reliability of 80%.

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.8}
