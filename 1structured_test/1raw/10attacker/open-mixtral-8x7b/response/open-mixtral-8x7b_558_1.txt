Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement is 0.8.

However, we cannot stop at this since there was a second witness who also made a statement. We need to consider the combined information from both witnesses.

Let's assume that the second witness is also correct, and the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm. Given this, the probability of the first witness stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (probability of error).

To estimate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to consider both scenarios.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness is correct) \* P(First witness is correct) + P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness errs) \* P(First witness errs)

Using the given information, we can calculate the overall probability as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.85 + 0.2 \* 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.68 or 68%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 68%.
