To solve this problem, we can use the law of total probability. This law allows us to calculate the probability of a certain event by summing up the probabilities of that event for each piece of evidence, weighted by the probability of that piece of evidence.

In this case, the event is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and there are two pieces of evidence: "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller" and "the first witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm". We can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given each piece of evidence, and then sum these probabilities weighted by the probability of each piece of evidence.

The probability of the first witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). The probability of the first witness saying the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). The probability of the second witness saying the attacker was shorter than 1
