Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.

Given that one witness supports the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the other does not, we need to calculate the probability of both scenarios being true.

P(A) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as claimed by Witness 1
P(B) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, as claimed by Witness 2

We want to find P(A), but we also have information about the witnesses' accuracy. We can calculate the probability of each witness's claim being true:

P(A|W1) = Probability that Witness 1 is correct in claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
P(B|W2) = Probability that Witness 2 is correct in claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.70

However, we also need to consider the possibility that Witness 2 is correct and Witness 1 is incorrect:

P(A|W2) = Probability that Witness 1 is incorrect in claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

Now, we need to calculate the combined probability of both witnesses' claims being true:

P(A and B) = P(A and B|W1) * P(W1) + P(A and B|W2) * P(W2)

We don't have information about P(W1) and P(W2), but they should be equal since there is no reason to favor one witness over the other. Therefore, we can simplify the equation:

P(A and B) = 0.5 * (P(A|W1) * P(B|W2) + P(A|W2) * P(B|W1))

Plugging in the values:

P(A and B) = 0.5 * ((0.80) * (0.70) + (0.20) * (0.70))
P(A and B) = 0.5 * (0.56 + 0.14)
P(A and B) = 0.5 * 0.70
P(A and B) = 0.35

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.35.
