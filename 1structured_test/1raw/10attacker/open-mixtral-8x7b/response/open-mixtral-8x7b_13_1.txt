Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when making height judgments.

To find the probability that the first witness is correct in this specific case, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

P(B|A) is the probability that the witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(B|not A) is the probability that the witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15, as given in the problem.

P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138 (41.38%)

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
