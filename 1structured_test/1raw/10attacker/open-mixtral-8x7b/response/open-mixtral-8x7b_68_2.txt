Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim)

To find this probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that both witnesses make their respective claims.

We want to find P(A|B), and we are given P(B|A), P(A), and P(B|A'), where A' is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First, we'll find P(B|A). This is the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since Witness 1 is always correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and Witness 2 has an 30% error rate, we have:

P(B|A) = 1 * (1 - 0.30) = 0.70

Next, we'll find P(A). This is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

Now, we'll find P(B|A'). This is the probability that both witnesses make their respective claims given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since Witness 1 has a 20% error rate and Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, we have:

P(B|A') = (1 - 0.20) * (1 - 0.70) = 0.14

Finally, we'll find P(B), which is the total probability of both witnesses making their respective claims.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')

Since we know P(B|A), P(A), P(B|A'), and P(A') (which is 85%), we can now find P(B):

P(B) = (0.70) * (0.15) + (0.14) * (0.85) = 0.1195 + 0.119 = 0.2385

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.70 * 0.15 / 0.2385
â‰ˆ 0.4608

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4608 or 46.08%.
