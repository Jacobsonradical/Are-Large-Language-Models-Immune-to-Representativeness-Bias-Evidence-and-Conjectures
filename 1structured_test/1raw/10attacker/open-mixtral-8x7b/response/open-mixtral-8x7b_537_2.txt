To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the events are the first witness's claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(B|A), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / P(A)

From the given information, we know that P(A|B) is the accuracy of the first witness when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. We also know that P(B) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to the problem statement.

To calculate P(A), we need to consider two possibilities: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. We can write P(A) as:

P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)

The first term, P(A and B), is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifies this, which is 80% \* 15% = 12%.

The second term, P(A and not B), is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20% \* 85% = 17%.

Therefore, P(A) = 12% + 17% = 29%.

Now we can calculate P(B|A):

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / P(A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
