Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, and they made this claim, so the probability is 0.8.

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, so the probability is 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.595.

Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we need to calculate the probability of the second witness being incorrect when the first witness is correct. The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time, so the probability is 0.3.

Now, we can calculate the probability of both events happening: the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect. Using the formula for conditional probability, we get:

P(A and B) = P(A) \* P(B|A)
P(Attacker is 185cm or taller and second witness is incorrect) = P(Attacker is 185cm or taller) \* P(Second witness is incorrect | Attacker is 185cm or taller)

We know that P(Attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(Second witness is incorrect | Attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.3. Therefore,

P(A and B) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.24.
