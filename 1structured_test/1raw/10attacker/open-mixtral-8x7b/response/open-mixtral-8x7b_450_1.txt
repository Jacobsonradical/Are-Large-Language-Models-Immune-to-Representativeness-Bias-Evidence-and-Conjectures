To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know from the question that P(A) is the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%, and P(not A) is the proportion that is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, which is 20%.

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Substituting the values we calculated above, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.414.
