Let's break down the information given:

1. The city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on witness 1's claim:

We know that witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller. Given that this witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
