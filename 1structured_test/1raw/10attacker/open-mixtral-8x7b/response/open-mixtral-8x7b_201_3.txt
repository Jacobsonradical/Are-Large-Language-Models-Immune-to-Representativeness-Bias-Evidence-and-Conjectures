Let's reason through this:

1. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time.
2. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which happens to be correct 70% of the time.
3. Since these are conflicting statements, one of the witnesses is incorrect.
4. Either the first witness is correct (with a 0.8 probability), or the second witness is correct (with a 0.7 probability).
5. However, since we're asked about the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement, we can't directly use the second witness's accuracy.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
probability: 0.8

The fact that the second witness thought the attacker was shorter than 185 cm does not change the first witness's claim or accuracy rate.
