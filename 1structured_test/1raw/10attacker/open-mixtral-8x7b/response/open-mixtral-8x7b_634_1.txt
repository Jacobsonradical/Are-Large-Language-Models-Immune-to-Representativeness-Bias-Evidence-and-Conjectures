To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height and the population statistics.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(T).

Using the first witness's statement and their ability to judge a person's height, we can calculate the probability that they would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness).

Now, we can find the probability of the complementary event, that is, the probability that the first witness would correctly claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.8 (the correct identification rate of the first witness).

Similarly, using the second witness's statement and their ability to judge a person's height, we can calculate the probability of the event that both witnesses claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The probability that the second witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 0.7 (the correct identification rate of the second witness).

Using the population statistics, we know that P(185 cm or taller) = 0.15.

Now, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

P(W1 & W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) * P(W2 | T)

where W1 and W2 denote the events that the first and second witnesses claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, respectively, and T denotes the event that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.

Given that P(W1 | T) = 0.8 and P(W2 | T) = 0.7, we have:

P(W1 & W2 | T) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(T | W1 & W2):

P(T | W1 & W2) = P(W1 & W2 | T) * P(T) / P(W1 & W2)

We want to find P(T), so let's rearrange the equation:

P(T) = P(T | W1 & W2) * P(W1 & W2) / P(W1 & W2 | T)

We can calculate P(W1 & W2) using the law of total probability:

P(W1 & W2) = P(W1 & W2 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 & W2 | T') * P(T')

where T' denotes the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and P(T') = 1 - P(T) = 0.85.

Now, we need to find P(W1 & W2 | T'), which is the probability that both witnesses claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

This probability can be calculated as:

P(W1 & W2 | T') = P(W1 | T') * P(W2 | T')

where P(W1 | T') is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, and P(W2 | T') is the probability that the second witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

We know that P(W1 | T') = 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness), and P(W2 | T') = 0.3 (the error rate of the second witness). Therefore:

P(W1 & W2 | T') = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, we can calculate P(W1 & W2):

P(W1 & W2) = P(W1 & W2 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 & W2 | T') * P(T')

P(W1 & W2) = 0.56 * 0.15 + 0.06 * 0.85 = 0.1432

Finally, we can calculate P(T):

P(T) = P(T | W1 & W2) * P(W1 & W2) / P(W1 & W2 | T)

P(T) = P(T) * P(W1 & W2) / P(W1 & W2 | T) (since P(T | W1 & W2) = P(T))

0.15 = P(T) * 0.1432 / 0.56

Solving for P(T):

P(T) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.1432

P(T) â‰ˆ 0.6108

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.6108.
