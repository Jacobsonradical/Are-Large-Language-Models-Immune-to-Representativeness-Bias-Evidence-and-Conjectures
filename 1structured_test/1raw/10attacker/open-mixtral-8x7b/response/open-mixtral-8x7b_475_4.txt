Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness, assuming the first witness is always correct. This would be the same as the percentage of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. 

However, we know that the first witness is not always correct. They are correct 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. Given this, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = P(first witness's claim is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, given the information available, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
