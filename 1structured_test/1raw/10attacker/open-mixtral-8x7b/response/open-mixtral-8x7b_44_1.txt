Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimations of the attacker's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. According to the city's population statistics, 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller according to Witness 1's claim, we need to calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct given their 80% accuracy rate.

Let's assume the attacker's actual height is 185 cm or taller. This would mean that Witness 1 is correct in this case. The probability of Witness 1 being correct is their accuracy rate, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
