Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us directly in this case.
3. However, we do know that the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
4. Therefore, given the first witness's statement, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%).

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
