Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

where:
- P(H|E) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
- P(E|H) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, as the first witness is correct 80% of the time.
- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15, as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- P(E) is the probability of the first witness making the claim, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

To calculate P(E), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|~H) * P(~H)

where ~H represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(E|~H) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.2, as the first witness errs 20% of the time.

Now, we can calculate P(E):

P(E) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate our estimate:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29, rounded to 4 decimal places}
{probability: 0.3448, rounded to 4 decimal places}
