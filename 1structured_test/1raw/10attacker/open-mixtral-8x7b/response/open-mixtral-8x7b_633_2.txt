Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony does not help us in this case.
3. According to the first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. So, there is an 80% chance that the first witness's statement is correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
5. However, there is also a 20% chance that the first witness is incorrect when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
6. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, can be calculated as follows:
   (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.29}
