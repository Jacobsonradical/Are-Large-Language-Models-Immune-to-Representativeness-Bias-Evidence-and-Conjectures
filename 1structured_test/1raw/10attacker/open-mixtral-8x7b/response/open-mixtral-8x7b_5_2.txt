Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when guessing if someone is shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given that one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller.

Let's consider two scenarios:

A) The attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. The probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8 (80%).

B) The attacker was not 185 cm or taller. This means the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and the probability of the second witness being incorrect is 0.3 (30%).

Now, we want to find the probability of scenario A given the evidence (the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller). Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|Evidence) = P(Evidence|A) * P(A) / (P(Evidence|A) * P(A) + P(Evidence|B) * P(B))

We know P(Evidence|A) = 0.8 (first witness correct), P(A) = 0.15 (population percentage taller than 185 cm), P(Evidence|B) = 0.3 (second witness incorrect), and P(B) = 0.85 (population percentage shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|Evidence) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85))
P(A|Evidence) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255)
P(A|Evidence) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(A|Evidence) = 0.31818 (approximately)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.31818 or 31.82%.
