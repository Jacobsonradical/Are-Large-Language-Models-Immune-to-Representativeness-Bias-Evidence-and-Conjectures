Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the population in the city is split roughly 85/15 between people shorter than 185 cm and people 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which they get right 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which they get right 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 made that claim. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller".

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.2 (witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.36}
