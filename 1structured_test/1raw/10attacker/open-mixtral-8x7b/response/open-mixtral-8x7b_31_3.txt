Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, and the second witness incorrectly identified the height as being shorter than 185 cm:

P(Correctly identified by W1) = 0.8
P(Incorrectly identified by W2) = 0.3

So, the probability of both events happening is:

P(W1 correct, W2 incorrect) = P(Correctly identified by W1) * P(Incorrectly identified by W2)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% in the question:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Finally, we need to find the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 correct, W2 incorrect) = P(W1 correct, W2 incorrect | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(W1 correct, W2 incorrect)

Using the probabilities calculated above, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 correct, W2 incorrect) = (0.8 * 0.7) * 0.15 / 0.24
= 0.3375 / 0.24
= 1.4 * 0.25
= 0.35

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.35.
