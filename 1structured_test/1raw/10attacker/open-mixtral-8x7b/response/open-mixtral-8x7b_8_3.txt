Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

Given these conditions, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's testimony) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
