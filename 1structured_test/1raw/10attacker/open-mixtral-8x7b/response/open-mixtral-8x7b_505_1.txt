To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We first calculate the likelihood of getting the first witness's testimony if the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(W1=tall | H=tall) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people as tall 80% of the time)

Next, we calculate the likelihood of getting the first witness's testimony if the attacker's height was NOT 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm):

P(W1=tall | H=short) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Next, we calculate the prior probabilities of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, and shorter than 185 cm, based on the population statistics:

P(H=tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(H=short) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony:

P(H=tall | W1=tall) = P(W1=tall | H=tall) \* P(H=tall) / P(W1=tall)
= P(W1=tall | H=tall) \* P(H=tall) / (P(W1=tall | H=tall) \* P(H=tall) + P(W1=tall | H=short) \* P(H=short))
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.36}
