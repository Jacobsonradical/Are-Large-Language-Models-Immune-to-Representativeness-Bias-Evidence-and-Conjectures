Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification rate of 70%.
4. Since both witnesses' claims contradict each other, we cannot use their combined probability to estimate the height of the attacker.
5. Instead, let's consider each witness's claim independently:
   - For Witness 1, there's an 80% chance they're correct when saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - For Witness 2, there's a 30% chance they're incorrect when saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (since the opposite, that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, would be correct in this case).
6. Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

The answer is: {probability: 0.24}
