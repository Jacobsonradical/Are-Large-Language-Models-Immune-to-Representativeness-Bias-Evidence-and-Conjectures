Let's break down the information given:

1. City statistics show that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

Let's denote:
- A as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"
- W1 as the event "the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- W2 as the event "the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"

We want to compute P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so. By applying Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We already know P(W1|A) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time), P(A) = 0.15 (city statistics on people being 185 cm or taller). We need to find P(W1) and P(W1|¬A), the latter being the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller when in reality the attacker is not.

To compute P(W1|¬A), imagine two mutually exclusive events - the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (B) or the second witness is incorrect (W2'). We can write:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B) + P(W1|W2') * P(W2')

However, we don't have enough information to compute P(W1|B) and P(W1|W2'). But, we can assume that if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, then either the first witness is mistaken (20% chance) or the second witness is mistaken (30% chance). In this case, the first witness would incorrectly claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This results in:

P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.12 + 0.16 + 0.06 = 0.34

Now we need to compute P(W1|¬A), the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1|¬A) = P(W1 and ¬A) / P(¬A)

We already know that P(W1 and ¬A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 since this is the case where the first witness is mistaken and the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Now we can compute P(W1|¬A) = 0.17 / 0.85 ≈ 0.2

Finally, we can compute P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.34 ≈ 0.353

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.353}
