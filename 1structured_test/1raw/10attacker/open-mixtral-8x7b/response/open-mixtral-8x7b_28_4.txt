Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement:

1. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. We know that witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.8}
