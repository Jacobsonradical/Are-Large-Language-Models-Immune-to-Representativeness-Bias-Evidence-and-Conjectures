Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. This means we want to find the probability that the first witness is correct.

To do this, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect.

P(1st witness correct) * P(2nd witness incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24.
