Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different claims, but we cannot directly use their testimonies as evidence because they contradict each other.
3. Instead, we can calculate the independent probabilities of each witness being correct and then combine them using Bayes' theorem.

Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
Let P(B1) be the probability that the first witness is correct.
Let P(B2) be the probability that the second witness is correct.

P(B1) = 0.8 (80% chance of identifying the correct height)
P(B2) = 0.7 (70% chance of identifying the correct height)

Now, we need to find the probability of each witness's claim given the attacker's height.

If the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:
P(B1|A) = P(first witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (witness is always correct when identifying a tall attacker)
P(B2|A) = P(second witness says shorter than 185 cm | attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3 (30% chance of identifying the incorrect height)

If the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(B1|¬A) = P(first witness says 185 cm or taller | attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (20% chance of identifying the incorrect height)
P(B2|¬A) = P(second witness says shorter than 185 cm | attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 1 (witness is always correct)

Now we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * (1 - P(A))]

Since we don't have information about the prevalence of tall attackers, P(A) is unknown. However, since the question asks for an estimate, we can make an assumption that the attacker is equally likely to be tall or short, so P(A) = 0.5.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1) = [1 * 0.5] / [1 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5]
P(A|B1) = 0.8

Format answer:
{probability: 0.8}
