Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if a person is 185 cm or taller. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating if a person is shorter than 185 cm.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct, given that this witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = P(First Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We are given P(First Witness claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)

To find P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller), we can use the second witness's claim and the city's population statistics:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Second Witness claims shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller in the city)
= 0.3 * 0.15
= 0.045

Now we can find our final estimate:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.045 â‰ˆ 0.036 or 3.6%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 3.6%.
