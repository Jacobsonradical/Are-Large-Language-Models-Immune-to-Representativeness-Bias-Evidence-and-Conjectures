Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is simply her accuracy rate of 80%.

Next, let's calculate the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15%.

Now, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller.

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + (1-0.2)*0.85] â‰ˆ 0.124

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.124 or 12.4%.
