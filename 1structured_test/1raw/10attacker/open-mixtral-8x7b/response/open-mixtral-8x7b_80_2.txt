Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time when they make such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means they believe witness 1 is wrong. This witness is correct 70% of the time when they disagree with witness 1's assessment.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find the combined probability that both conditions hold true: Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect.

The probability that Witness 1 is correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability that Witness 2 is incorrect is 0.3 (30%). Multiplying these two probabilities together gives us our estimate:

Probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 or 24%

{probability: 0.24}
