Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can do this by calculating the probability that the first witness is correct AND the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and then dividing this by the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This means that she is correct with a probability of 0.8 when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Let's assume that the attacker is representative of the general population. This means that the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (0.15) plus the probability that the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17).

Therefore, the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.12) divided by the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.32).

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / 0.32 = 0.375.
