Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
2. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
3. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Given this information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, and we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, would be 0.8 (or 80%).

Formal answer: {probability: 0.8}
