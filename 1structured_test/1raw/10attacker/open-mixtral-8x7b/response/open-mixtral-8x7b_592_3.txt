Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probability of each statement being correct and then multiply them together.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which they get correct 80% of the time. So the probability of this statement being correct is 0.8.
4. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which they get correct 70% of the time. So the probability of this statement being correct is 0.7.
5. However, since these are contradictory statements, only one of them can be correct. Therefore, the probability we want is the probability that the first witness is correct AND the second witness is incorrect.
6. The second witness being incorrect means they said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm when they were actually 185 cm or taller, which happens 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 of the time.
7. So, the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect is 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16.

The answer is therefore: {probability: 0.16}
