To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' accuracy and the population distribution.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller,
- W1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller,
- W2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller,
- E1 as the first witness being correct, and
- E2 as the second witness being correct.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of A given W1. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. 

Now, let's compute P(W1|A). Given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the first witness is correct 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find P(W1). We can do this by calculating the probabilities of W1 for both cases (A and not A), and then applying the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)

For P(W1|¬A), given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the first witness is correct 20% of the time, so P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we need P(¬A): since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Putting it all together:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

Finally, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.33 ≈ 0.36

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.36}.
