Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time when they disagree, we have to consider two scenarios:
1. The first witness is correct.
2. The second witness is correct.

Let's calculate the joint probability of these scenarios, given the information about their accuracy and the population statistics:

1. P(first witness correct) = 0.8
   P(second witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3
   P(population 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
   Joint probability: P(first correct, second incorrect, attacker 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.3 * 0.15 ≈ 0.036

2. P(first witness incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
   P(second witness correct) = 0.7
   P(population shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
   Joint probability: P(first incorrect, second correct, attacker shorter) = 0.2 * 0.7 * 0.85 ≈ 0.119

Now, let's find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness's claim:
P(attacker 185 cm or taller | first witness claim) = Joint probabilities / (Joint probabilities + P(second incorrect, second correct, attacker shorter))
≈ 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.119)
≈ 0.233

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.233}
