Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses, W1 and W2, who made conflicting statements about the attacker's height. W1 stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, while W2 stated that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We also have their accuracy rates in judging a person's height under similar conditions:
   - W1 is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
   - W2 is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we need to consider the scenario where W1 is correct and W2 is not.

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given W1's claim, can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1's claim) = P(W1 is correct) * P(W2 is incorrect) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population)

We have the following probabilities:
- P(W1 is correct) = 0.8 (80%)
- P(W2 is incorrect) = 1 - P(W2 is correct) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (30%)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population) = 0.15 (15%)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1's claim) = (0.8) * (0.3) * (0.15) = 0.036 or 3.6%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as W1 claimed, is 3.6%.

Answer: {probability: 0.036}
