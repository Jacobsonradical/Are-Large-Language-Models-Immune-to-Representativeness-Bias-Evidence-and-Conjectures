Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately.
2. Witness 1 states that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 states that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement.

For Witness 1:
The probability of Witness 1 being correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% chance)

For Witness 2:
The probability of Witness 2 being incorrect when they say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 1 - 0.7 (30% chance they're wrong) = 0.3
Since Witness 2's error leads to the possibility of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use this probability to support Witness 1's claim.

Since these two events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to get the overall probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 incorrect)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.3

{probability: 0.24}
