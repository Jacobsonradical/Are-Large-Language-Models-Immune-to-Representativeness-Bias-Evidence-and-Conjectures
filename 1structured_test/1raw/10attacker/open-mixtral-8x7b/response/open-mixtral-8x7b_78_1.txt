To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. In this case, the two events are "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller."

Let A represent the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and B represent the event "the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B). We can compute each term as follows:

* P(B|A): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the accuracy of the first witness, which is 80%.
* P(A): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is given by the first piece of information as 15%.
* P(B): The probability that the witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This can be computed as the sum of P(B and A) and P(B and not A), or equivalently, P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A).

We can compute P(B|not A) as the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 100% - 80% = 20%. The prior probability P(not A) is 85%. Putting this together, we get:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.16 + 0.17 = 0.33

Finally, we can compute P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.33 â‰ˆ 0.36

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.36.
