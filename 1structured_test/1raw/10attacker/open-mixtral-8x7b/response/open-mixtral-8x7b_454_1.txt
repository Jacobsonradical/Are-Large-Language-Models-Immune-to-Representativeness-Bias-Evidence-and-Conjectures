Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:

P(taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1's claim | taller) * P(taller) / P(witness 1's claim)

We are given:
P(witness 1's claim | taller) = 0.8
P(taller) = 0.15

To find P(witness 1's claim), we need to consider two scenarios:
A. Both witnesses are correct: P(w1 correct & w2 correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56
B. Witness 1 is correct and witness 2 is not: P(w1 correct & w2 incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, P(witness 1's claim) = P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) = 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(taller | witness 1's claim):
P(taller | witness 1's claim) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.15

The final answer is: {probability: 0.15}
