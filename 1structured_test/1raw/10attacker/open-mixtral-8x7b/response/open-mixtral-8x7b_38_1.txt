Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we can multiply their accuracy rate by the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population (15%).

The calculation would be as follows:
Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = Accuracy of Witness 1 * Base rate
Probability(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
