Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed. This means we want to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct, given their statement and their error rate.

We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 said so.

We know:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that Witness 1 is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We can calculate P(B and A) = P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

To find P(B and not A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85
We need to find P(B|not A), the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since Witness 1 is wrong in 20% of the cases when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Now, we can calculate P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can calculate P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, is approximately 0.345.
