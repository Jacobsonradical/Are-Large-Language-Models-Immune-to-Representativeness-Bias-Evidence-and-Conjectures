Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is consistent with our estimate.
3. However, the first witness is not always correct. According to the information provided, they are correct 80% of the time and mistaken 20% of the time.
4. Therefore, we need to adjust our estimate based on the reliability of the first witness.
5. To do this, we can multiply the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (15%, as given in "b") by the accuracy of the first witness (80%).

The final answer is therefore: {probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, "or 12%"}.
