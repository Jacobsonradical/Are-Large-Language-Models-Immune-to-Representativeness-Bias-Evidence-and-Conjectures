Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
2. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability of the first witness correctly identifying an attacker of that height as follows:
   P(Correct ID | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
3. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker was not 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not as follows:
   P(Incorrect ID | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Correct ID when attacker is shorter than 1
