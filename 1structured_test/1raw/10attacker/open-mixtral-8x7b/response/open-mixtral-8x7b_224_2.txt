To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height and multiplying it by the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as well as finding the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height and multiplying it by the probability that the witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, and that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information from the first witness.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W be the event that the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then we want to find P(A|W). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(A|W) = P(A and W) + P(not A and W)

= P(A) * P(W|A) + P(not A) * P(W|not A)

= 0.15 * 1 + 0.85 * 0.20

= 0.15 + 0.17

= 0.32

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.32.
