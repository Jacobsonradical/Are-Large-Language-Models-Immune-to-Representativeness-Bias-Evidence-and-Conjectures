Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who saw the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time. So, when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they're right.
3. Witness 2, who said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time. So, when they say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance they're right.
4. The two statements contradict each other, so we're interested in the probability that witness 1 is correct given their statement and the fact that at least one of the witnesses is correct (since we know the attacker's height must be either taller or shorter than 185 cm).
5. The probability that both witnesses are correct is 0.8 (witness 1) * 0.7 (witness 2) = 0.56.
6. The probability that both witnesses are incorrect is 0.2 (witness 1) * 0.3 (witness 2) = 0.06.
7. The probability that witness 1 is correct and witness 2 is not is 0.8 (witness 1) * 0.3 (witness 2) = 0.24.
8. Since we know at least one witness is correct, we're interested in the last scenario (witness 1 correct, witness 2 incorrect) which has a probability of 0.24.

So, {probability: 0.24}
