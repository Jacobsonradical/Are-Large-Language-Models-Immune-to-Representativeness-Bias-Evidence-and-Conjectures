Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height accurately:
   - Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
   - Witness 2 correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's claim. To do this, we can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of that event occurring under each possible condition, weighted by the probability of each condition.

In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller. The possible conditions are Witness 1 being correct in her claim and Witness 1 being incorrect in her claim.

First, let's calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct:
- Given that a person is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that Witness 1 correctly identifies them as such (according to her abilities described in a).
- Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability of Witness 1 being correct is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12

Next, let's calculate the probability of Witness 1 being incorrect:
- Given that a person is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller (according to her abilities described in a).
- Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of Witness 1 being incorrect is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Now, let's apply the law of total probability:
- The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is the sum of the probability of Witness 1 being correct and the probability of her being incorrect but still claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- The latter probability can be calculated as the product of the probability of Witness 1 being incorrect and the probability of a randomly selected person being shorter than 185 cm (since, if she's incorrect, that's who she'd claim the attacker to be). This is equal to 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.1445.

Finally, let's calculate the total probability:
- The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is the sum of the probabilities calculated above: 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2645}
