To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This involves finding the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement, and then weighting these probabilities by the reliability of each witness.

From the first witness's statement, we know that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Given that 15% of the population meets this criteria, and the first witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 \* 0.15
= 0.12

From the second witness's statement, we know that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Given that 85% of the population meets this criteria, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, the probability that the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm based on the second witness's statement is:

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2) = P(Witness 2 says attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.7 \* 0.85
= 0.595

Since the second witness is incorrect about the attacker's height, we need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the second witness's statement being incorrect. This can be calculated as:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) = P(Witness 2 says attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.3 \* 0.15
= 0.045

To find the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on both witness statements, we can use the law of total probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) \* P(Witness 1 is correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) \* P(Witness 2 is correct | Witness 1 is incorrect)
= 0.12 \* 0.5 + 0.045 \* 0.5
= 0.06 + 0.0225
= 0.0825

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.0825, or 8.25%.
