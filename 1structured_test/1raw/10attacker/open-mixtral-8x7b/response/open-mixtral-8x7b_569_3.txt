Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's statement) = P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (the probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Substituting the values:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's statement) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
