Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means there is a 70% chance they are correct in this case.
5. However, since the second witness and the first witness disagreed, we cannot rely solely on the second witness's statement for our calculation.
6. Instead, we should calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
7. If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the first witness will correctly identify this 80% of the time.
8. If the attacker is actually shorter than 1
