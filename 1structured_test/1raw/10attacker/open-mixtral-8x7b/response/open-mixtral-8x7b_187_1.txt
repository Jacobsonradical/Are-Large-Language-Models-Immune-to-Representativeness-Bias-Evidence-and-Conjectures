Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony, and then combine these probabilities using Bayes' theorem.

For the first witness, who claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability of this statement being true is the same as the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

For the second witness, who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability of this statement being true is the complement of the probability of the first witness being correct when stating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, the first witness is correct 30% of the time. Thus, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.3, and the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to combine these probabilities. Let H be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that both witnesses claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / (P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H))

where ~H is the complement of H, meaning the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(~H) = 0.85.

We can calculate P(E|H) = 0.8 \* 0.8 = 0.64, since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is correct 80% of the time as well.

We can also calculate P(E|~H) = 0.3 \* 0.7 = 0.21, since the first witness is correct only 30% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness is correct 70% of the time.

Putting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.64 \* 0.15 / (0.64 \* 0.15 + 0.21 \* 0.85)

Calculating this gives us:

P(H|E) = 0.405

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is approximately 40.5%.
