Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. 

To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct simultaneously, given their individual accuracy rates. 

The probability of Witness 1 being correct is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of Witness 2 being correct is 0.5 (since the attacker must be shorter than 185 cm, which Witness 2 claimed, and Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so 30% of the time they are incorrect, meaning the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller).

So, the probability of both witnesses being correct simultaneously is 0.8 * 0.5 = 0.4 (40%). 

However, this does not answer our question directly. We are interested in the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made this claim. 

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of various events. 

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that both witnesses correctly identified the attacker's height.

We want P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and we just calculated that P(B|A) = 0.4 (the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) = 0.4 and P(A) = 0.15.

P(B|not A) is the probability of both witnesses being correct when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56 (70% accuracy for Witness 2, and 20% accuracy for Witness 1, since they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

And P(not A) is the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population).

So, P(B) = (0.4 * 0.15) + (0.56 * 0.85) = 0.06 + 0.476 = 0.536

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.4 * 0.15) / 0.536 = 0.06 / 0.536 â‰ˆ 0.112

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.112 (11.2%).
