Let's break down the problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker being in the taller group.
3. However, Witness 1 is only correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
4. So, even though the attacker is in the taller group, we need to account for the possibility that Witness 1 might be incorrect.

Now let's calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct given their error rate:

P(Correct) = 0.8 (witness's accuracy)
P(Incorrect) = 1 - P(Correct) = 0.2

Given that the attacker is in the taller group, the probability that Witness 1 would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller is:

P(Taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Correct) * P(Taller) + P(Incorrect) * P(Shorter)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.29}
