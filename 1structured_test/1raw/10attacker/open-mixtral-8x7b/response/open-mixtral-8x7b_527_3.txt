Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7

Now, let's calculate the joint probability that both witnesses are correct in their claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(1st and 2nd correct) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd correct) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Now, let's calculate the joint probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect:

P(1st correct and 2nd incorrect) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd incorrect) = 0.8 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.16

We are interested in the scenario where the first witness is correct, so we will consider both cases where they are correct and the second witness is either correct or incorrect.

P(attacker 185 cm or taller) = P(1st and 2nd correct) + P(1st correct and 2nd incorrect) = 0.56 + 0.16 = 0.72

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.72}
