To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We have two witnesses, one who thought the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and another who thought the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B)

where:
A: attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: first witness is correct

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15 (from a)
P(first witness is correct) = 0.8 (from b)
P(first witness is incorrect) = 0.2 (from b)
P(second witness is correct) = 0.7 (from b)
P(second witness is incorrect) = 0.3 (from b)

Now, we need to find P(A and B) and P(A and not B).

P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
P(A and not B) = P(A) * P(not B|A) = 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03

Now, we can calculate the final estimate:
P(attacker's height was 185 cm or taller) = P(A and B) + P(A and not B) = 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
