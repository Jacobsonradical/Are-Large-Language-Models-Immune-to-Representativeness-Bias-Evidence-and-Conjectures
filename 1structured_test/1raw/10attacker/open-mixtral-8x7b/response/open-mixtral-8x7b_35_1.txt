Let's analyze the problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a random person is 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we don't know if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so we need to consider the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 1
