Let's break down the problem and reason through it:

1. We know that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy for this claim is 80%.
2. We know that Witness 2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy for this claim is 70%.
3. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability based on Witness 1's claim:

The probability of Witness 1 being correct, given their accuracy rate, is 0.8 (80%). To find out the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can multiply this probability by the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 0.15 (15%).

So, the calculation is: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
