Let's consider the two witnesses' statements as two independent events, A and B, where A represents the first witness's claim of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B represents the second witness's claim of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (A). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|185 cm) * P(185 cm) = P(185 cm|A) * P(A)

From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(185 cm) = 0.15.

We also know that the first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(A|185 cm) = 0.8.

To find P(185 cm|A), we need to consider the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the actual height of the attacker. This can be calculated as:

P(185 cm|A) = P(A and 185 cm) / P(A)

The probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the first witness claiming so is the true positive rate, which is 0.8 for the first witness. The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A and 185 cm) + P(A and < 185 cm)

The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm (a false positive) can be calculated as the false positive rate, which is 1 - the true positive rate or 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

Therefore, P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.18 + 0.14 = 0.32.

Now we can find P(185 cm|A):

P(185 cm|A) = P(A and 185 cm) / P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.32 ≈ 0.375.

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim A:

P(A|185 cm) * P(185 cm|A) / P(A) = 0.8 * 0.375 / 0.32 ≈ 0.9167.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.9167 (91.67%).
