Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as being 185 cm or taller.
b) The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as being shorter than 185 cm.
c) 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct, given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:
P(185 cm) = 15% = 0.15

The first witness is correct 80% of the time when saying a person is 185 cm or taller:
P(witness1_correct | 185 cm) = 0.8

The first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when saying a person is 185 cm or taller:
P(witness1_incorrect | 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we need to find the probability that the witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is 185 cm:
P(185 cm | witness1_correct) = P(witness1_correct) * P(185 cm) / P(witness1_correct & 185 cm)

Since P(witness1_correct & 185 cm) = P(185 cm), we can simplify the equation:
P(185 cm | witness1_correct) = P(witness1_correct) * P(185 cm) / P(185 cm)
P(185 cm | witness1_correct) = P(witness1_correct)
P(185 cm | witness1_correct) = 0.8

However, there is also a chance that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm. We need to find this probability as well.

The second witness is correct 70% of the time when saying a person's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(witness2_correct | <185 cm) = 0.7

The second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when saying a person's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(witness2_incorrect | <185 cm) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Now we need to find the probability that the second witness is incorrect, given that the person's height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(witness2_incorrect & <185 cm) = P(witness2_incorrect) * P(<185 cm)
P(witness2_incorrect & <185 cm) = 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255

Now we need to find the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm:
P(185 cm | witness1_incorrect) = P(witness1_incorrect & witness2_incorrect) / P(witness2_incorrect & <185 cm)
P(185 cm | witness1_incorrect) = P(witness1_incorrect) / P(witness2_incorrect & <185 cm)
P(185 cm | witness1_incorrect) = 0.2 / 0.255 ≈ 0.784

Now we can calculate the overall probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:
P(185 cm) = 0.15
P(witness1_correct) = 0.8
P(185 cm | witness1_correct) = 0.8
P(witness1_incorrect) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
P(185 cm | witness1_incorrect) ≈ 0.784

P(185 cm | witness1_claimed_185) = P(witness1_correct) * P(185 cm | witness1_correct) + P(witness1_incorrect) * P(185 cm | witness1_incorrect)
P(185 cm | witness1_claimed_185) = 0.8 * 0.8 + 0.2 * 0.784 ≈ 0.792

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.792.
