Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a problem of dependent events, as the two witnesses' testimonies are not independent.
3. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct with 80% probability and incorrect with 20% probability.
4. If the first witness is correct, then the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, should also say the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
5. If the first witness is incorrect, then the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm, would actually claim the attacker is shorter than 1
