Let's break down the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b) We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement:

For Witness 1, the probability of them being correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).

For Witness 2, the probability of them being correct when they say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7 (70%). Since Witness 2's claim contradicts Witness 1's claim, the probability of Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being wrong is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (24%).

To combine the probabilities from both witnesses, we can use the formula for total probability:

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)

Where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B1 is the event that Witness 1 is correct, and B2 is the event that Witness 2 is correct.

P(A) = P(A|B1) * P(B1) + P(A|B2) * P(B2)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.24 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.204
= 0.324

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.324}.
