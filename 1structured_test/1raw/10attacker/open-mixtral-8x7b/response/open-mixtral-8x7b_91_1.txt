Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when they make such a claim.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time when they make such a claim.

Given these conditions, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller because Witness 1's testimony aligns with reality 80% of the time, while Witness 2's testimony only aligns with reality 70% of the time when they claim someone is shorter than 185 cm.

However, to provide a numerical estimate, we would need to use Bayes' theorem. This involves calculating the prior probability (the initial probability before any evidence is taken into account), the likelihood (the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis), and the posterior probability (the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence).

Calculating the exact probabilities would require specific numerical values for the number of people in the city, as well as more detailed statistics about the distribution of heights within the population. Since we don't have this information, we can't provide an exact numerical estimate.

So, I will answer in the requested format, but with the caveat that the number I provide is an educated guess rather than a precise calculation:
{probability: 0.75, please note that this is an estimate based on the given information}
