Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.

To calculate this probability, we can use the formula for Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness thinks the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."

We know the following probabilities:
- P(B|A): The probability that the first witness thinks the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, as the first witness is correct 80% of the time.
- P(A): The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the information given in part b of the question. This is 0.15, as 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B): The probability that the first witness thinks the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. To find this probability, we can use the law of total probability:
  - P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
  - P(B and A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the first witness thinks it is. This is equal to P(B|A) * P(A), which is (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12.
  - P(B and not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller and the first witness thinks it is. We can calculate this probability by finding the complement of P(not B|not A), which is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. As the first witness is correct 80% of the time, they are wrong 20% of the time, so P(not B|not A) is 0.2. The complement of this probability is 0.8, so P(B and not A) is 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.68.
  - Therefore, P(B) is 0.12 + 0.68 = 0.8.

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8 = 0.15

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
