Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, meaning that 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. According to the first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This means that there is an 80% chance that the first witness was correct when making this statement.
3. According to the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. This means that there is a 70% chance that the second witness was correct when making this statement.

Given that the two statements contradict each other, we can't accept both as true. We must choose between them. Since the first witness has a higher success rate in estimating height, it seems more likely that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's calculate the probability based on the first witness's claim:

- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. With a 80% success rate, this gives us a probability of 0.8.

So, {probability: 0.8}
