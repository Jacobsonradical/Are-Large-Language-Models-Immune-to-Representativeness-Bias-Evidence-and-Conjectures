To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will calculate the probability based on each witness's statement and then combine them using the law of total probability.

First, let's consider the statement of the first witness. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when determining if a person is 185 cm or taller and errs 20% of the time. Since the witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we are interested in the case where the witness is correct. So, the probability in this scenario is 0.8.

Next, let's consider the statement of the second witness. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when determining if a person is shorter than 185 cm and errs 30% of the time. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we are interested in the case where the witness is incorrect. The probability of this happening is 0.3.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the statements of both witnesses. Using the law of total probability, we combine the probabilities from the two scenarios above:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) * P(first witness is correct)
+ P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness is incorrect) * P(second witness is incorrect)

We know that P(first witness is correct) = 0.8, P(second witness is incorrect) = 0.3, and we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the second witness is incorrect. To find this probability, let's use the population statistics:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness is incorrect) = P(second witness is incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(second witness is incorrect)

From the information given:
P(second witness is incorrect) = 0.3
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(second witness is incorrect | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3 (since the second witness errs 30% of the time in this scenario)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness is incorrect) = 0.3 * 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the final probability using the law of total probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) + 0.3 * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness is incorrect)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 1 + 0.3 * 0.15
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 + 0.045
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.845

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.845}.
