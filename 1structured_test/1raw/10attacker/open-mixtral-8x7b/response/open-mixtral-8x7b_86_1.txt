Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 said so. This is a conditional probability and can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which we know is 15%.
- P(B|A) is the probability that witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. Since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, P(B|A) = 0.80.
- P(B|not A) is the probability that witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is NOT actually 185 cm or taller. This is equivalent to the probability that witness 1 makes a mistake, which is 20%.
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is NOT 185 cm or taller, which is 85%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) = 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
