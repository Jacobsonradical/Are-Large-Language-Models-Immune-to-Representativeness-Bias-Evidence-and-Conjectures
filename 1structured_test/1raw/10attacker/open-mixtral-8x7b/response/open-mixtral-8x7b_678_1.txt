Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimations of the attacker's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, we need to consider both witnesses' testimonies.

The probability of Witness 1 being correct and the attacker being 185 cm or taller is given by P(A and B), where A is the event of Witness 1 being correct and B is the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Using the given information, P(A) = 0.8 and P(B) = 0.15. However, we don't have enough information about the relationship between A and B to directly calculate P(A and B).

To proceed, let's consider the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made the claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(B | A) = (P(A | B) * P(B)) / P(A)

We're looking for P(B | A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 made the claim.

We know P(A | B), the probability of Witness 1 being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 1 (since Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller).

We know P(B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.

We know P(A), the probability of Witness 1 being correct, is 0.8.

However, we don't have enough information about P(A | B'), the probability of Witness 1 being correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Without this information, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the question. But if you would like an estimate based on the available information, we can assume that Witness 1's accuracy (0.8) is equally applicable to both cases: shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller. In that case, we can estimate:

P(A | B') = 0.8 (80% accuracy for Witness 1 when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, with this assumption, we can re-apply Bayes' theorem to calculate our estimate of P(B | A).

P(B | A) = (P(A | B) * P(B)) / P(A)
P(B | A) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.8
P(B | A) â‰ˆ 0.1875

However, this is only an estimate based on the given information and the assumption that Witness 1's accuracy is the same for both height categories.

{probability: 0.1875}
