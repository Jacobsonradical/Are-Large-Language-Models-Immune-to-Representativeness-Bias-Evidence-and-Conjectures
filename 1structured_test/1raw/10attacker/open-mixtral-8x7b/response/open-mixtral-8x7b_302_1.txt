Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

Witness 1:
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's testimony) = P(witness 1's statement is correct) = 0.8

Witness 2:
- P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's testimony) = P(witness 2's statement is correct) = 0.7

Now, since both witnesses must be correct for their combined testimonies to be accurate, we need to calculate the probability of both events happening:

P(both witnesses correct) = P(witness 1 correct) * P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct)

Given that the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, the second witness's accuracy when the first witness is correct can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct) = P(witness 1 correct | witness 2 correct) * P(witness 2 correct) / P(witness 1 correct)

We know that P(witness 1 correct) = 0.8 and P(witness 2 correct) = 0.7. To find P(witness 1 correct | witness 2 correct), we can use the population statistics provided:

P(witness 1 correct | witness 2 correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct) = (0.15 * 0.7) / 0.8 ≈ 0.13125

Now, calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct:

P(both witnesses correct) = P(witness 1 correct) * P(witness 2 correct | witness 1 correct) = 0.8 * 0.13125 ≈ 0.105

Finally, our estimate for the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.105.
