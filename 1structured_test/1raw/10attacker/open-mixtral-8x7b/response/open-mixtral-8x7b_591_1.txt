Let's break down the information given and reason through it.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (and errs 20% of the time).
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (and errs 30% of the time).

Given these conditions, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. To do this, we need to find the probability of the first witness being correct, given the discrepancy of the second witness.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

We have the following probabilities from the information given:
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (first witness's 80% accuracy)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter)

Now, we need to find P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter):
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) = 1 - P(Witness 1 claims shorter | Attacker is shorter)
- P(Witness 1 claims shorter | Attacker is shorter) = 0.2 (first witness's 20% error rate)
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8

Now, we can find P(Attacker is shorter):
- We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(Attacker is shorter) = 0.85

Finally, we can calculate P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller):
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85) = 0.8 + 0.06 = 0.86

Now, we can calculate P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller):
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.86 â‰ˆ 0.1395

{probability: 0.1395}
