Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185|W185) = 0.8 (80% accuracy of first witness when the true height is 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller when they actually are:

P(W185|A185) = 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A185|W185) = P(W185|A185) * P(A185) / P(W185)

We know P(W185|A185) and P(A185) from the information given. To find P(W185), we need to calculate the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller, which can be calculated as follows:

P(W185) = P(W185|A185) * P(A185) + P(W185|A<185) * P(A<185)

where P(A<185) = 0.5 (since there's a 50% chance that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185cm)
and P(W185|A<185) = 0.2 (20% chance of the first witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(W185) = (0.5*0.15) + (0.2*0.5) = 0.15 + 0.1 = 0.25

Now we can calculate the final probability:

P(A185|W185) = (0.5*0.15) * (0.8 / 0.25) = 0.12 * 3.2 = 0.384

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.384}.
