To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both witnesses and the general population height distribution in the city.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B as the event that the first witness's claim is correct
- C as the event that the second witness's claim is correct
- D as the event that both witnesses' claims are correct

From the information provided:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller)
P(C|A) = 0.3 (second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (second witness is correct 70% of the time when the true height is not 185 cm or taller)

Now, we want to find the probability of A given B, P(A|B):

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We need to find P(B). To do that, let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, P(D):

P(D) = P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|¬A) * P(¬A)

First, calculate P(D|A):
P(D|A) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Then, calculate P(D|¬A):
P(D|¬A) = P(B|¬A) * P(C|¬A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can find P(D):
P(D) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Next, we need to find P(B):
P(B) = P(D) + P(B and not D)

Calculate P(B and not D):
- The first witness is correct, so the height is 185 cm or taller
- However, the second witness is not correct, which has a probability of 0.3 when the true height is 185 cm or taller
P(B and not D) = P(B|A) * P(not D|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, calculate P(B):
P(B) = 0.155 + 0.24 = 0.395

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.395 ≈ 0.304

Answer: {probability: 0.304}
