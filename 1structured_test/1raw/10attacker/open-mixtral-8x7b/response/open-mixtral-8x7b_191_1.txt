Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A) = Probability of attacker being 185cm or taller AND witness 1 says so
= P(attacker is 185cm or taller) * P(witness 1 says so | attacker is 185cm or taller)
+ P(attacker is NOT 185cm or taller) * P(witness 1 says so | attacker is NOT 185cm or taller)

We know from (b) that P(attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(attacker is NOT 185cm or taller) = 0.85
From (a), we have P(witness 1 says so | attacker is 185cm or taller) = 0.8 and P(witness 1 says so | attacker is NOT 185cm or taller) = 0.2

Substituting these values into the formula for P(A):

P(A) = (0.15)*(0.8) + (0.85)*(0.2)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 29%.
