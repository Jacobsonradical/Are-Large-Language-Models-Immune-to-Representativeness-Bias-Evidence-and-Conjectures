Let's break down the problem and calculate the probabilities:

1. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
2. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.
3. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness's claim) = P(first witness's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
