Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement.

For the first witness, they correctly identify the correct height 80% of the time and err 20% of the time. Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the first witness will claim so with a probability of 0.8 and claim shorter with a probability of 0.2.
