Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when he claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, this probability is 0.8.

Now let's consider the information about the population. If we randomly choose a person from the city, the probability that they are 185 cm or taller is 0.15, since 15% of the population is in this category.

Given the two witnesses' testimonies, it seems more likely that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, since both witnesses agreed on this point. However, we cannot ignore the possibility that both witnesses made an error, which would mean that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to weigh the two probabilities based on the reliability of the witnesses. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, we can use a weight of 0.8 for his testimony. For the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, we can use a weight of 0.7.

Using these weights, we can calculate the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows:

(probability of being 185 cm or taller) x (first witness correct) + (probability of being shorter than 185 cm) x (first witness incorrect)

= (0.8) x (probability of being 185 cm or taller) + (0.2) x (probability of being shorter than 185 cm)

= 0.8 x 0.15 + 0.2 x 0.85

= 0.12 + 0.17

= 0.29

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.29}.
