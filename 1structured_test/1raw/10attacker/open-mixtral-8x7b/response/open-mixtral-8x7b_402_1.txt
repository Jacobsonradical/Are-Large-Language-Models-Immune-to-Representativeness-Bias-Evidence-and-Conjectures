To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We'll consider the claims of both witnesses and calculate the probability based on their individual accuracy rates.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(A and W1 is correct) + P(B and W2 is correct)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, W1 is the claim of the first witness, and W2 is the claim of the second witness. Events A and B are mutually exclusive, as the attacker cannot be both taller and shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's find the probabilities:

P(A and W1 is correct) = P(A) * P(W1 is correct | A) = (0.15) * (0.8) = 0.12
P(B and W2 is correct) = P(B) * P(W2 is correct | B) = (0.85) * (0.7) = 0.595

Now, using the law of total probability,

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(A and W1 is correct) + P(B and W2 is correct) = 0.12 + 0.595 = 0.715

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.715}.
