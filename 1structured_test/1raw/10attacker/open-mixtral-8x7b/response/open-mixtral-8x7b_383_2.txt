Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

In order to calculate the probability, we need to consider both the witness's reliability and the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller.

Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim (P(A|W1)) = P(W1|A) * P(A)

P(W1|A) is the probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
P(A) is the base rate of attackers who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

So, P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12 (or 12%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
