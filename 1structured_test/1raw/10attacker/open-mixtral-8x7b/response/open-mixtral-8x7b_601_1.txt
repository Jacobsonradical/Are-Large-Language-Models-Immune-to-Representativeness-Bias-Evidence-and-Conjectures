Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making such judgments.
3. Witness 2 says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making such judgments.

Given this information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by Witness 1.

We can calculate this probability using Bayes' theorem, which in this case would look something like:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Here, A represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are trying to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 made this claim.

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 incorrectly claims someone is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.45

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by Witness 1, is approximately 0.45.
