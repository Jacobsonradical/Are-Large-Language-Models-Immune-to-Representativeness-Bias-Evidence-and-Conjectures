To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's denote:

P(A): probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(B): probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(C): probability that the second witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(D): probability that both witnesses say the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

From the problem statement, we know P(B) given P(A), and P(C) given P(A). We want to find P(A) given P(B) and P(C). Using the formula for conditional probability, we can write:

P(A|B,C) = P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(C|A') * P(A'))

where A' is the complement of A, meaning the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8, P(C|A) = 1 (since the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but we are considering the case where the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller), and P(C|A') = 0.7.

From the population statistics, we know that P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|B,C) = (0.8)*(1)*(0.15) / ((0.8)*(1)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.7)*(0.85))

After calculating, we get:

P(A|B,C) â‰ˆ 0.5556

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.5556 or 55.56%.
