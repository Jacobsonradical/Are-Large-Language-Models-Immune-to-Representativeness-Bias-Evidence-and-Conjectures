Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. We also know that in the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.
3. The witness's claim of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is essentially the same as him identifying a randomly chosen person from the city's population as being 185 cm or taller.
4. So, given that the base rate for someone being 185 cm or taller is 15%, and the witness is correct 80% of the time, we can calculate the updated probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- Event A as "the person is 185 cm or taller"
- Event W as "the witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller"

We want to find P(A|W), the probability of the person actually being 185 cm or taller given that the witness identified them as such.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W) = [P(W|A) * P(A)] / P(W)

We're given P(W|A) = 0.8 (the witness is correct 80% of the time)
And we're given P(A) = 0.15 (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(W), which is the overall probability of the witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities for both cases: the person is actually 185 cm or taller and the person is not 185 cm or taller.

P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A)
where ~A denotes not being 185 cm or taller, and P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
Also, P(W|~A) is the false positive rate, which for the second witness is 0.3 (70% correct rate means 30% error rate)

So, P(W) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W):

P(A|W) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

{probability: 0.32}
