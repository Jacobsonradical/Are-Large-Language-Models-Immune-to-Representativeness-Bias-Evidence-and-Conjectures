Let's break down the problem and calculate the probabilities:

1. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.
3. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there is a 15% chance that a person is 185 cm or taller.
4. To find the probability that both witnesses would incorrectly claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, we need to find the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the person is 185 cm or taller (20% chance) AND the second witness also incorrectly claims the person is 185 cm or taller (30% chance). Since these are independent events, we multiply the probabilities: 20% * 30% = 6%.
5. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 6% chance that both witnesses would incorrectly claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

We know:
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 80% (first witness's correct identification rate)
- P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% (population statistics)
- P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter)
  = 80% * 15% + 20% * 85% = 12% + 17% = 29%

So, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
