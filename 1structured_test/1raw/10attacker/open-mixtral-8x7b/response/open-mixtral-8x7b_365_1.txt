To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This law states that the probability of an event can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of that event given each possible mutually exclusive condition, multiplied by the probability of that condition.

In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and there are two conditions based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
E = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1 = First witness's claim (attacker is 185 cm or taller)
W2 = Second witness's claim (attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We are given:
P(E) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1 | E) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2 | ¬E) = 0.7 (second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find:
P(E | W1) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(E | W1) = P(W1 | E) * P(E) / P(W1)

Now, we need to find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of probabilities of this event given each condition (E and ¬E), weighted by the probabilities of the conditions:

P(W1) = P(W1 | E) * P(E) + P(W1 | ¬E) * P(¬E)

We are given all the values needed to compute P(W1). However, we do not have the exact probability of the second witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (P(W1 | E)). We can estimate this value based on the fact that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

If the second witness is correct 70% of the time, then the first witness must be wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is:

P(W1 | E) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7

Now we can compute P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1 | E) * P(E) + P(W1 | ¬E) * P(¬E) = (0.7 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.105 + 0.17 = 0.275

Finally, we can calculate P(E | W1):

P(E | W1) = P(W1 | E) * P(E) / P(W1) = (0.7 * 0.15) / 0.275 ≈ 0.3636

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3636, or 36.36%.
