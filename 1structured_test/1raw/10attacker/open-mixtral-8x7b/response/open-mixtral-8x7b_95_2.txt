Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. Therefore, given that the first witness stated the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that this statement is correct.

So, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.8}
