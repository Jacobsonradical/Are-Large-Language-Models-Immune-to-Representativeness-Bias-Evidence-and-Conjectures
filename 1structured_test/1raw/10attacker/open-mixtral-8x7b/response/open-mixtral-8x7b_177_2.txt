To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following reasoning:

1. Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let W1 and W2 be the events where witness 1 and witness 2 are correct, respectively.
3. We want to find P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 made this claim.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate: P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) / P(W1)
5. We are given P(W1 | H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.15, and we can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability: P(W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) + P(W1 | not H) * P(not H)
6. To find P(W1 | not H), we need to calculate the probability of witness 1 being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since there's a 0.8 probability of witness 1 being correct for people taller than 185 cm, there's a 0.2 probability of witness 1 being incorrect for people taller than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(W1 | not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 + 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.23
7. Now we can calculate P(W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) + P(W1 | not H) * P(not H) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.23 * 0.85) ≈ 0.277
8. Finally, we can calculate P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) / P(W1) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.277 ≈ 0.361
