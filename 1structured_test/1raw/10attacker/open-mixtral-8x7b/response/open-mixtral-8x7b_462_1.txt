Let's reason through this:

1. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time.
2. The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which happens to be correct 70% of the time.

Given these two conflicting statements, we need to estimate the likelihood that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller.

Since the second witness's claim (attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is correct 70% of the time, this means that when the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance they are right and a 30% chance they are wrong (and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).

However, the court can't use this information directly because it's based on the second witness's claim, not the first witness's claim. To connect these, consider the times when the second witness is wrong (30% of the time). In those cases, the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. But those are also exactly the situations where the first witness is correct (since they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller). So, the probability that the first witness is correct is equal to the probability that the second witness is wrong, which is 0.3.

So, {probability: 0.3}
