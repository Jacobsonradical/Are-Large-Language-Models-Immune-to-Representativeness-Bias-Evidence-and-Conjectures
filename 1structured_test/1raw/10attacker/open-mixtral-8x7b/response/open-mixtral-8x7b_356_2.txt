Let's break down the problem and calculate the probability:

1. According to the first witness, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%).
2. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the actual population distribution.
4. The probability that the first witness correctly identified an attacker who is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (witness accuracy), and the probability of an attacker actually being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (population distribution).
5. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

{probability: 0.12}
