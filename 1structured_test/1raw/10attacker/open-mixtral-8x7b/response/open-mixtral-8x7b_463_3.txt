Let's analyze the information given:

A. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

B. We also know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and P(S) as the probability that the attacker's height was not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm).

First, let's calculate the combined accuracy of the two witnesses. Since both their errors are independent, we can calculate the combined probability of them both being correct (or both being incorrect) at the same time.

P(Correct) = P(Correct1) * P(Correct2) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56
P(Incorrect) = P(Incorrect1) * P(Incorrect2) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, since we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller (and the witnesses' errors are more likely to occur for this group), we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

P(T | Correct1 and Correct2) = (P(Correct1) * P(Correct2)) / (P(Correct1) * P(Correct2) + P(Incorrect1) * P(Incorrect2)) = (0.56) / (0.56 + 0.06) = 0.903226

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 90.32%.

However, this is not the final answer, as we need to take into account the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller. We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so:

P(T) = 0.15

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(T | Correct1) = (P(Correct1 | T) * P(T)) / (P(Correct1 | T) * P(T) + P(Correct1 | S) * P(S))

P(Correct1 | T) = Probability of witness1 being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(Correct1 | S) = Probability of witness1 being correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2
P(S) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85

P(T | Correct1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.105882

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 10.59%.
