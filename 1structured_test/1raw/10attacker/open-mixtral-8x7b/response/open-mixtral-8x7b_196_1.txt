Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs (identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller) 20% of the time. 

b) The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs (identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm) 30% of the time.

c) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since we have conflicting statements from the two witnesses, we cannot determine with certainty whether the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we can estimate the probability based on the given information.

Let's define event A as "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B as "the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height."

We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, which is 80% or 0.8.

P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

P(B|not A) is the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, which is 20% or 0.2.

P(not A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.345}.
