Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(B), we need to consider two cases:
- Case 1: The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The probability of this event is P(A) = 0.15. In this case, the first witness will claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller with probability P(B|A) = 0.8. So, the probability of observing B in this case is P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = (0.8) \* (0.15)
- Case 2: The attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this event is P(not A) = 0.85. In this case, the first witness will claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller with probability P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time). So, the probability of observing B in this case is P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = (0.2) \* (0.85)

Now, we can find P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = (0.8) \* (0.15) + (0.2) \* (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = (0.8) \* (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
