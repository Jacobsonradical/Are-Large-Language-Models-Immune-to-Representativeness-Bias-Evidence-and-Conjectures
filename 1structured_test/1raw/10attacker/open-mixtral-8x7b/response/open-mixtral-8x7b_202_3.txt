Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
2. We also know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- We need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is equal to the false positive rate, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time, so they incorrectly claim a person is 185 cm or taller 30% of the time).

Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
