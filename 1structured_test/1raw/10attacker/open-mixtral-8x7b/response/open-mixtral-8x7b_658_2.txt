Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means there is a 70% chance that they are correct and a 30% chance that they are mistaken.
5. Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the probability that both witnesses are correct and the probability that the first witness is correct while the second is not.
6. The probability that both witnesses are correct is 0.8 (first witness) * 0.7 (second witness) = 0.56 or 56%.
7. The probability that the first witness is correct and the second is not is 0.8 (first witness) * 0.3 (second witness) = 0.24 or 24%.
8. To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement, we add the probabilities from steps 6 and 7: 0.56 + 0.24 = 0.8 or 80%.

{probability: 0.8}
