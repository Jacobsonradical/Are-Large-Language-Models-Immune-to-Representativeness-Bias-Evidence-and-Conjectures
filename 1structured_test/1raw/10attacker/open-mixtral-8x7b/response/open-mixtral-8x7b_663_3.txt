Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we should consider the scenario where the first witness is correct and the second witness is wrong.

The probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of the second witness being wrong is 0.3. Since these events are independent, we can multiply the probabilities:

0.8 (first witness correct) * 0.3 (second witness wrong) = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
