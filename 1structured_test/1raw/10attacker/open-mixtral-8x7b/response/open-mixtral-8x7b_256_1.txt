Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

P(W1 corr) = probability that the first witness is correct = 0.8
P(W2 corr) = probability that the second witness is correct = 0.7

Now, let's calculate the combined probability of both witnesses being correct:

P(W1 corr and W2 corr) = P(W1 corr) * P(W2 corr) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Next, we need to calculate the combined probability of the first witness being correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the second witness being incorrect (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):

P(W1 corr and W2 inc) = P(W1 corr) * P(W2 inc) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 claim) = P(W1 corr and W2 corr) + P(W1 corr and W2 inc)
= 0.56 + 0.24
= 0.8

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8}
