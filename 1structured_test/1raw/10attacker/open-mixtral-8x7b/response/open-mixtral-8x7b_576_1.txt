Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 true) = probability that the first witness is correct when saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% chance)

P(W2 true) = probability that the second witness is correct when saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.7 (70% chance)

Now let's find the probability that both witnesses are correct, which means the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller:

P(W1' true & W2 true) = P(W1 true) * P(W2 true | W1 true)

However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate P(W2 true | W1 true). But, we can calculate the probability of the opposite:
P(W2 false | W1 true) = P(W2 false) + P(W1 true) - P(W1 true and W2 true)

We know that the attacker is either 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm, so:
P(W2 false | W1 true) = 0.3 (30% chance of W2 being wrong) + P(W1 true and W2 true)

Rearranging the terms, we have:
P(W1 true and W2 true) = P(W2 false | W1 true) - 0.3

Now, we have:
P(W1' true & W2 true) = P(W1 true) * P(W2 false | W1 true) - 0.3 * P(W1 true)

We are interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements:
P(Attacker 185 cm or taller | W1 true and W2 true) = P(W1 true and W2 true | Attacker 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker 185 cm or taller) / P(W1 true and W2 true)

Since we are looking for the most probable height of the attacker, we can calculate the initial prior probability P(Attacker 185 cm or taller) based on the population data:
P(Attacker 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)

Plugging in all the values, we have:
P(Attacker 185 cm or taller | W1 true and W2 true) = 0.8 * (P(W2 false | W1 true) - 0.3) * 0.15 / (0.8 * (P(W2 false | W1 true) - 0.3) * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

Solving this equation, we have:
P(Attacker 185 cm or taller | W1 true and W2 true) â‰ˆ 0.55 (55%)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.55 (55%).
