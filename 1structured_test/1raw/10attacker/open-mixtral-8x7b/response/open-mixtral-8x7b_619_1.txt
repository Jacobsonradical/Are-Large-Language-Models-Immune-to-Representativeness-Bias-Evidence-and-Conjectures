Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses.
2. Since the two witnesses' claims are contradictory, one of them must be wrong.
3. We can calculate the probability of each witness being correct, based on their individual abilities to judge a person's height.
   - Witness 1: Correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20% of the time.
   - Witness 2: Correct 70% of the time, incorrect 30% of the time.
4. We are interested in the scenario where Witness 1 is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller), so let's consider the probability of this happening.
5. For Witness 1 to be correct, it means that Witness 2 must be incorrect in this case.
6. Since Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time, the probability of both witnesses' claims being true is 0.7 * 0.8 = 0.56 or 56%.
7. However, we want to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct when their claim contradicts Witness 2.
8. In order for Witness 1 to be correct, the attacker must be 185 cm or taller, and the population distribution from point "a" tells us that this is the case for 15% of the population.
9. Thus, the probability we are looking for is the probability of Witness 1 being correct (0.8) multiplied by the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15).

The answer is:
{probability: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 or 12%}
