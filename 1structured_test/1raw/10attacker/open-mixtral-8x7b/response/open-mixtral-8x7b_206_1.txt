To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. 

Let's define our terms:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know that P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).

We also know that P(A) is the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) according to the data provided.

Calculating P(W1), the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is a bit more complex. This can happen in two ways: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the witness correctly identifies this, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller. So, P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A).

Here, P(W1|not A) is the probability that the witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, which is 0.2 (20%). And P(not A) is the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting these values into the formula for Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.383 or 38.3%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.383}.
