Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the given information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness's statement. Given that the second witness is correct 70% of the time, there's a 30% chance of error.
5. However, we can't directly use these percentages to calculate the probability because the witnesses' statements contradict each other.
6. Instead, let's consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
7. If the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the first witness is correct and a 20% chance the first witness is wrong. If the first witness is correct, the second witness is wrong 30% of the time. So the probability of both witnesses being wrong is 20% * 30% = 6%.
8. If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance the second witness is correct. In this case, the first witness is wrong, which happens 20% of the time. So the probability of both witnesses being wrong is 70% * 20% = 14%.
9. Since there's a higher probability of both witnesses being wrong in the scenario where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, it is more likely that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
10. Therefore, our estimated probability is the complement of the probability of both witnesses being wrong when the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 1 - 6% = 0.94 or 94%.

{probability: 0.94}
