Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when guessing if someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. We also know that in the city, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A|B) is the probability we want to find, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we need to calculate.

P(B) can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not.

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
