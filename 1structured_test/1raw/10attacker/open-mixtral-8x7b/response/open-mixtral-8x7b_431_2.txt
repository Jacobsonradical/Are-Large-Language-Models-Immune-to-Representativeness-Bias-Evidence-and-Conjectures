Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's statement.

For the first witness, the probability of them being correct is 80%, and the probability of them being incorrect is 20%. Given that the witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's statement) = P(witness 1 is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

For the second witness, the probability of them being correct is 70%, and the probability of them being incorrect is 30%. Given that the first witness stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the second witness must also have stated that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 and 2's statements) = P(witness 1 is correct) * P(witness 2 is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.7

However, we also need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to the given information. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * 0.15)
= 0.096 / (0.096 + 0.03)
= 0.096 / 0.126
= 0.7619047619047619

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7619047619047619}
