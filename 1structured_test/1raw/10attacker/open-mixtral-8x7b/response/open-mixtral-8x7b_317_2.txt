Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person's height as being shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b. 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that this claim is correct. To do this, we need to find the probability that both witnesses would make that claim if the attacker's height were 185 cm or taller, and compare that to the probability that both witnesses would make that claim if the attacker's height were shorter than 185 cm.

If the attacker's height were 185 cm or taller:

* The first witness will claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
* The second witness will claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

The probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, is:

0.8 * (1 - 0.3) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

If the attacker's height were shorter than 185 cm:

* The first witness will claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
* The second witness will claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time.

The probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, is:

0.2 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim, we divide the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, by the sum of that probability and the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

probability = 0.56 / (0.56 + 0.06) = 0.56 / 0.62 â‰ˆ 0.9032

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.9032}
