Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed so. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 said so).
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (in this case, the probability that witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is).
- P(A) is the prior probability of A (in this case, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) is the probability of B (in this case, the probability that witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We're given P(A), which is 15%.

P(B|A) is the accuracy of witness 1, which is 80%.

However, to calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases - when the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm and when they're shorter. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A).

P(B and A) is the probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they actually are, which is 80% * 15% = 12%.

P(B and not A) is the probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they're not, which is (100% - 80%) * 85% = 17%.

So, P(B) = 12% + 17% = 29%.

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 80% * 15% / 29% = 32.1%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.321 or 32.1%.
