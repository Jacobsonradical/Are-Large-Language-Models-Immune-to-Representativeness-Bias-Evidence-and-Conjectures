Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, their testimony doesn't provide any useful information for this particular question, so we can ignore it.
3. The first witness correctly identifies people taller than 185 cm 80% of the time.
4. However, we also need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population, which is 15% according to the information provided.
5. To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height.
- P(A) is the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) is the probability of the first witness making the statement they made.

6. We know P(B|A) is 0.8 (80%), and P(A) is 0.15 (15%). We need to find P(B), the probability of the first witness making their statement.
7. The first witness makes a statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be true or false.
8. If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the witness will make the statement 80% of the time, as we know from the problem statement.
9. If the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the witness will make the statement 20% of the time because they have an error rate of 20% when judging people as shorter than 185 cm.
10. So, we need to find the overall probability of the first witness making the statement by considering both scenarios:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

11. Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138 (41.38%).
