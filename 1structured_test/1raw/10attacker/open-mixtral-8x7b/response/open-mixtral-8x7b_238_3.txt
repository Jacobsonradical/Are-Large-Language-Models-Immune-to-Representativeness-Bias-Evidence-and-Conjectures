Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness's statement) = P(First Witness's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
