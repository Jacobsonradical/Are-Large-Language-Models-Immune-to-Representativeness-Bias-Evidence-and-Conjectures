Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens 80% of the time when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. The probability of this is P(A).

We also need to consider the case where the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, but they are actually shorter than 185 cm, which happens 20% of the time. The probability of this is P(B).

Given that there are two witnesses, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B)]

We know that P(W1|A) is the probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8. Similarly, P(W1|B) is the probability of the first witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.

We are given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(B) = 0.85 (100% - 15%).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [(0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.6429

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.6429 or 64.29%.
