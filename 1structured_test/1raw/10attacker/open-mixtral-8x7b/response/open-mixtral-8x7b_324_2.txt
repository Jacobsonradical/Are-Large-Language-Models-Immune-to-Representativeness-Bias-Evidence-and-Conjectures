Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know she is correct 80% of the time, so:

P(witness1 correct | attacker 185 cm or taller) = 0.8

Next, we need to calculate the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of what the witness said. We are told that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 1
