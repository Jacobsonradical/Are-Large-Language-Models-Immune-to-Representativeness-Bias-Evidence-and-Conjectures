Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
b. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.
c. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

To calculate this probability, we need to find the probability that both witnesses would make a mistake (since they contradict each other) and then subtract that probability from 1.

First, find the probability that the first witness is incorrect and estimates that the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This happens 20% of the time.

Second, find the probability that the second witness is incorrect and estimates that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This happens 30% of the time.

Since these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to find the combined probability that both witnesses make a mistake:

P(both make a mistake) = P(first is incorrect) * P(second is incorrect)
= 0.20 * 0.30
= 0.06 or 6%

Now, to find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, we subtract the combined probability of both witnesses making a mistake from 1:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness claims so) = 1 - P(both make a mistake)
= 1 - 0.06
= 0.94 or 94%

Answer: {probability: 0.94}
