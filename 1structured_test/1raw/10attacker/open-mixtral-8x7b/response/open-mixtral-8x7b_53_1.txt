Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses who gave conflicting statements about the attacker's height. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, while the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, the first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases. The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the testimony of both witnesses. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we know that this witness must have been incorrect. Therefore, we can focus on the testimony of the first witness.

The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and this witness is correct 80% of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8, or 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
