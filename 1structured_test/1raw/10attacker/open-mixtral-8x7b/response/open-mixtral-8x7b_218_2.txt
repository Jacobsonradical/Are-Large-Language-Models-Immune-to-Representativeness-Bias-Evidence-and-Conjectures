To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

From statement a, we know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height. Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(not B|not A) = 0.7.

From statement b, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(A) = 0.15.

To calculate P(not B|not A), we need to find the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate this by finding the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller in each case where the witness is incorrect, and then taking a weighted average based on the witness's overall error rate.

When the witness is incorrect, there is a 50% chance that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, and a 50% chance that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The witness will claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8, and will claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.2. Therefore, the witness will claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in 50% * 0.2 = 0.1 of the cases where the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, and in 50% * 0.8 = 0.4 of the cases where the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

Taking a weighted average based on the witness's overall error rate, we find that P(not B|not A) = 0.1 * 0.5 + 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Putting all of this information into the conditional probability formula, we get:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.25 * 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.324

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.324}.
