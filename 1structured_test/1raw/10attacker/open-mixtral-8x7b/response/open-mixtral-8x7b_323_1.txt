Let's analyze the information given:

a) Witness 1 correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time.
Witness 2 correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and is wrong 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's denote:
A = Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1 = First witness is correct
W2 = Second witness is correct

From the information given, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population, where A' represents not A)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (First witness is correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A') = 0.2 (First witness is wrong when the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|A) = 0.7 (Second witness is correct when the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|A') = 0.3 (Second witness is wrong when the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller)

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

To calculate P(W1), we need to consider all possible outcomes:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A')

Now, calculate P(W1):
P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W1):
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
