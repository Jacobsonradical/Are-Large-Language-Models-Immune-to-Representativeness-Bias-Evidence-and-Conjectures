Let's analyze the information to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

1. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be correct 80% of the time.
2. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time.
3. Given their abilities to judge height, it seems more likely that the first witness is correct, considering their higher accuracy rate.
4. However, we cannot simply take the first witness's statement at face value, as the second witness also provided conflicting information.
5. To estimate the probability, we need to consider the likelihood of both witnesses being correct simultaneously and the likelihood of them being wrong at the same time.
6. The first witness being correct and the second witness being wrong has an estimated probability of 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.
7. The second witness being correct and the first witness being wrong has an estimated probability of 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14.

Based on this analysis, we have more confidence in the first witness's claim, as the probability of both witnesses being correct (0.24) is higher than the probability of both being wrong (0.14).

{probability: 0.67 (24/36, rounded to two decimal places)}
