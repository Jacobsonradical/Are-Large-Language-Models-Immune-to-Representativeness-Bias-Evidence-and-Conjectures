Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we will consider the worst-case scenario for the first witness, in which the second witness is correct. In this case, the first witness would be incorrect.

We need to calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(2nd correct) = 0.85 (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm) * 0.7 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm) + 0.15 (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller) * 0.3 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

P(2nd correct) = 0.595 + 0.045 = 0.64

Now, given that the second witness is correct, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller would be:

P(1st incorrect) = 1 - P(1st correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Finally, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so, while considering the second witness being correct.

P(attacker 185+ | 1st witness claims 185+ and 2nd is correct) = P(1st correct and attacker 185+) / P(1st witness claims 185+)

P(attacker 185+ | 1st witness claims 185+ and 2nd is correct) = P(1st correct) * P(attacker 185+) / P(1st witness claims 185+ and 2nd is correct)

P(attacker 185+ | 1st witness claims 185+ and 2nd is correct) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.2 * 0.64)

P(attacker 185+ | 1st witness claims 185+ and 2nd is correct) = 0.9375

However, this probability is based on the assumption that the second witness is correct. Since the witnesses cannot both be correct, the actual probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based solely on the first witness's claim is 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate when identifying people as 185 cm or taller).
