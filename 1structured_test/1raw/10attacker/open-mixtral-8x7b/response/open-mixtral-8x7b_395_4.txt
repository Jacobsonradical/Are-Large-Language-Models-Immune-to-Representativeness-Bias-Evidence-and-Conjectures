Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(A|B).

- P(B|A) is the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B|not A) is the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20%).
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
