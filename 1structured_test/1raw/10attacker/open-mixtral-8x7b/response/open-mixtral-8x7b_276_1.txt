Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. Since the second witness's claim contradicts the first, we will not consider their statement.

Let's define our probabilities:

P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(B) = Probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
P(E) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Given the information, we need to find P(A|E), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We are given P(E|A) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate) and P(A) = 0.15 (population percentage with height 185 cm or taller).

To find P(E), we need to consider the two possibilities: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct (with probability P(E|A) * P(A)), and the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller, and the first witness errs (with probability P(E|A') * P(A')).

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|A') * P(A')

Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and we're assuming their claim to be incorrect, we have P(E|A') = 1 (the first witness will always claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller if they believe the attacker is shorter). Then, P(E|A') * P(A') = 1 * (1 - P(A)) = 1 * 0.85 = 0.85

Now, we can find P(A|E):

P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.1235

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1235 or 12.35%.
