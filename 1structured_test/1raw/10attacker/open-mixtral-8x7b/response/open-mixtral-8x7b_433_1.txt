To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. Calculate the probability that the first witness's claim and the reality match.
4. Use Bayes' theorem to combine the above probabilities and calculate the final estimate.

Calculations:

P(A) = Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(¬A) = Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller = 0.2

P(B|A) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 1
P(B|¬A) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.5 (50% of the time the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and half of those cases are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

P(A|B) = (1 * 0.8) / ((1 * 0.8) + (0.5 * 0.2))
P(A|B) = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.1)
P(A|B) = 0.8 / 0.9
P(A|B) ≈ 0.89 (89%)

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 89%.
