To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two witnesses and the population statistics. We'll denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

1. Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which agrees with their correct assessment 80% of the time (and disagrees 20% of the time).
2. Witness 2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which agrees with their correct assessment 70% of the time (and disagrees 30% of the time).
3. Based on the population statistics, 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter.

Let's analyze the possible outcomes when both witnesses agree on the attacker's height:

A and B agree that the attacker is taller than 185 cm:
- Probability of agreement = P(A) * P(B|A)
- P(B|A) is the probability of Witness B being correct given Witness A is correct.
- P(B|A) = 1 - P(B'|A) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 (Witness B errs 30% of the time)
- Probability of agreement = P(A) * 0.7

A and B agree that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- Probability of agreement = P(A') * P(B|A')
- P(B|A') is the probability of Witness B being correct given Witness A is incorrect.
- P(B|A') = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- Probability of agreement = P(A') * 0.85 = (1 - P(A)) * 0.85

For the two witnesses to agree, the probabilities of these two scenarios must be equal:

P(A) * 0.7 = (1 - P(A)) * 0.85

Solving for P(A), we get:

P(A) = 0.5833 or 58.33%

So our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.5833, or 58.33%}
