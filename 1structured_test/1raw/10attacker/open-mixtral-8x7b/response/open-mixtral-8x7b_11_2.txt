Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185cm and 15% are 185cm or taller.

However, the information about the witnesses' abilities doesn't help us estimate the attacker's height unless we know how the witnesses' errors are distributed. For example, if the first witness says a person is taller than 185cm when they are actually not, it would mean a different thing than if the first witness says a person is shorter than or equal to 185cm when they are actually taller. Without this information, we can't accurately estimate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements.

Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, based on the given information.
