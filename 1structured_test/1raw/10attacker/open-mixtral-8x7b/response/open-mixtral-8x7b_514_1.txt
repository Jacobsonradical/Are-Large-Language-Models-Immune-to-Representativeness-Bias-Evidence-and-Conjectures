Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which occurs with a probability of 15%.
3. However, we need to consider the reliability of Witness 1. The court assessed that Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height.
4. Therefore, the probability of Witness 1 being correct, given that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.

The final answer is: {probability: 0.12}
