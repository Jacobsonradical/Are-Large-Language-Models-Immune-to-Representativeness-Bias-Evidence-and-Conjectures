Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185) = 0.8 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:

P(S<185) = 0.7 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm)

Since both events cannot be true at the same time, we need to calculate the probability of the first statement being true given that the second statement is false:

P(A185 | S<185) = P(A185) * P(S<185)^(-1)

We also know from the information provided that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, or mathematically, P(S<185) = 0.85. Substituting the values, we get:

P(A185 | S<185) = 0.8 * (0.7)^(-1) * 0.85 â‰ˆ 0.77

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.77.
