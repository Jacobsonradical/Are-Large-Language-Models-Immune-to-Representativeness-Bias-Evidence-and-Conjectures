Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which happens 85% of the time naturally.
5. This witness is correct 70% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given these percentages, it seems more likely that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, since that's the case 85% of the time. But we need to factor in the reliability of the witnesses.

If the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, the first witness would correctly identify this 80% of the time, or 0.8 times. If the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, the first witness would incorrectly claim they were 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, or 0.2 times.

So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is:

P(A=185cm | W1 claims A=185cm) = P(W1 claims A=185cm | A=185cm) * P(A=185cm) + P(W1 claims A=185cm | A<185cm) * P(A<185cm)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 29%.
