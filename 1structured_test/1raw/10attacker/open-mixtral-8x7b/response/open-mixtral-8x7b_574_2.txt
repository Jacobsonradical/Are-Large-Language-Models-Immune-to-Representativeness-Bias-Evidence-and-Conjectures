To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height and the distribution of heights in the city's population.

Let's define the following events:

* A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* B1: The first witness correctly identifies a person as being 185 cm or taller
* B2: The second witness correctly identifies a person as being shorter than 185 cm
* C: Both witnesses identify the attacker's height correctly

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B1) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
* P(B2) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

We want to find P(A|C), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses identified the attacker's height correctly.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(C)

We need to find P(C), which can be calculated as:

P(C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A is the complement of A (the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) and P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we need to find P(C|A) and P(C|¬A).

P(C|A) = P(B1|A) \* P(B2|A) = 0.8 \* 1 = 0.8 (if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the first witness will always identify the attacker correctly, and the second witness will have a 70% chance of identifying the attacker correctly)

P(C|¬A) = P(B1|¬A) \* P(B2|¬A) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14 (if the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, the first witness will have a 20% chance of identifying the attacker incorrectly as being 185 cm or taller, and the second witness will have a 70% chance of identifying the attacker correctly)

Now we can find P(C):

P(C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.163

Finally, we can find P(A|C):

P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(C) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.163 = 0.735

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.735}
