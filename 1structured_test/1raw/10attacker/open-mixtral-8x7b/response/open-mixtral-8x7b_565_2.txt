Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, the probability of them being correct is 80% (0.8) and the probability of them being incorrect is 20% (0.2). Since the witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we are interested in the case where the witness is correct. Therefore, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the first witness is 0.8.

For the second witness, the probability of them being correct is 70% (0.7) and the probability of them being incorrect is 30% (0.3). In this case, the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, so we are interested in the opposite case - that is, the attacker being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening given the second witness's testimony can be calculated as the product of the probability of the second witness being incorrect (0.3) and the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15, as stated in part b of the information provided). So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to the second witness is 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045.

To estimate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to combine the probabilities from both witnesses. Since these are independent events, we can simply multiply the probabilities together:

Overall probability = Probability according to Witness 1 * Probability according to Witness 2
Overall probability = 0.8 * 0.045

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.036}
