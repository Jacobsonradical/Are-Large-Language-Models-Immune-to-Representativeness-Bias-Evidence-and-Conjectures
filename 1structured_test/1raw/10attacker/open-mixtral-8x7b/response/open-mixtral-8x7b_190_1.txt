Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification of a tall person 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with their correct identification of a short person 70% of the time.

Given these statements, it seems more likely that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, as both witnesses' accounts corroborate this height. However, we need to calculate the probability based on the information provided about their accuracy.

The probability that Witness 1 is correct is 0.8 (80%). The probability that Witness 2 is incorrect is 0.3 (30%). Since both witnesses' claims must be true for the attacker to be 185 cm or taller, we multiply these probabilities:

0.8 (W1 correct) * 0.3 (W2 incorrect) = 0.24

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.24 or 24%. This might seem counter-intuitive given that the first witness is usually accurate, but considering the second witness's inaccuracy, the overall probability is quite low.
