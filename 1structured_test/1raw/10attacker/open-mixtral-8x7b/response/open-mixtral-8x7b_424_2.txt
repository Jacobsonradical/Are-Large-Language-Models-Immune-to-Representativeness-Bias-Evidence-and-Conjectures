Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case can be written as:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's statement) = P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1's statement)

We are given P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).

We are also given P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

Now, let's calculate P(Witness 1's statement), which is the probability of witness 1 making that statement regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(Witness 1's statement) = P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1's statement | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We have the first term; for the second term, we need to find the probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. Since witness 1 errs 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (20% error rate applied to the 85% of the population who are shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can calculate P(Witness 1's statement):

P(Witness 1's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.1445 = 0.2645

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's statement) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.2645 = 0.12 / 0.2645 â‰ˆ 0.4538

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4538 or 45.38%.
