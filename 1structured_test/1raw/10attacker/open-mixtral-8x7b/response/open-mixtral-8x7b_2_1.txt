Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and mistaken 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
b. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and mistaken 30% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.
c. In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do that, we can calculate the probability of the first witness being correct, given the population statistics (b), and multiply it by the accuracy of the first witness (a).

The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the same as the second witness claiming that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. So, we want P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

Now, we calculate P(First witness is correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the first witness is mistaken 20% of the time when the true height is shorter than 185 cm).

Finally, we find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(First witness is correct | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.85 * 0.2
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - 0.17
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.83

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.83}
