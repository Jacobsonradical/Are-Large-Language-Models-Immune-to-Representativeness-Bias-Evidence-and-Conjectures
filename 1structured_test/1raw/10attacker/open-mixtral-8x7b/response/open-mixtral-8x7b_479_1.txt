Let's break down the problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in estimating a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. We also know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on each witness's statement.

For Witness 1:
Since they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time, the probability of this statement being true is 0.8.

For Witness 2:
Since they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time, the probability of this statement being true is 0.7. However, this statement contradicts Witness 1's claim, so we need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (0.15) based on the city's population.

To combine these probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. Since Witness 2's claim contradicts Witness 1's claim, we will calculate the probability of Witness 2 being wrong, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3. Now, we can calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct, given Witness 2 is wrong:

P(W1 | W2') = [P(W2') * P(W1)] / [P(W2') * P(W1) + P(W2) * P(not W1)]
= [0.3 * 0.8] / [(0.3 * 0.8) + (0.7 * 0.15)]
â‰ˆ 0.7619

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8 (Witness 1's claim) or 0.7619 (combined probability), rounded to 0.76}
