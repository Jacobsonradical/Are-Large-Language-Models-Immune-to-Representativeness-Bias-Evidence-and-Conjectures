Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which according to the statistics, represents 15% of the population.
3. However, Witness 1 is only correct 80% of the time when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller. This means that there's a 20% chance they're wrong.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, would be the product of the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller (15%) and the accuracy of Witness 1 (80%).

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12}
