Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of Witness 1. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and E represent the event "Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller". We want to find P(A|E), the probability of A given E.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

- P(E|A) is the probability of Witness 1 being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time in such cases, P(E|A) = 0.8.

- P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.

- P(E) is the probability of Witness 1 making the claim regardless of whether it's true or false. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of Witness 1 being correct and making the claim, and Witness 1 being incorrect and making the claim.

  - P(E and A) = P(E|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
  - P(E and not A) = P(E|not A) * P(not A) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
  - P(E) = P(E and A) + P(E and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

So, P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345

{probability: 0.345}
