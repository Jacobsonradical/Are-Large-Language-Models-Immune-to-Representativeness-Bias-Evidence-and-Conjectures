Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time when making this claim.
3. The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time when making this claim.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: P(B|A) * P(A) and P(B|not A) * P(not A).
  - P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and they are correct 70% of the time, P(B|not A) = 0.3 (30% of the time the second witness makes a mistake and agrees with the first witness).
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
  - Therefore, P(B) = (0.8*0.15) + (0.3*0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

{probability: 0.32}
