Let's analyze the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:
- Event A is "The attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- Event B is "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller."

We are interested in finding P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

To find P(A|B), we need to calculate:

P(B|A) = The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) = The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.15 (15%).

P(B) = The probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is a combination of two possibilities: the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller and Witness 1 correctly identifies this, or the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but Witness 1 erroneously claims so.

P(B) = [P(B and A)] + [P(B and not A)]
= [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
= (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter)]
= (0.12) + [(1 - 0.2) * 0.85] (since Witness 1 is wrong 20% of the time)
= (0.12) + (0.8 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

Now we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.8
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 (or 12%).
