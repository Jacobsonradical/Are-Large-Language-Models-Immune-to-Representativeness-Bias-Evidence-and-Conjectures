Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probabilities for each statement and then combine them using the formula for total probability.
3. The first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time in such cases. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement is 0.80.
4. The second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time in such cases. So, the probability of the attacker being shorter than 1
