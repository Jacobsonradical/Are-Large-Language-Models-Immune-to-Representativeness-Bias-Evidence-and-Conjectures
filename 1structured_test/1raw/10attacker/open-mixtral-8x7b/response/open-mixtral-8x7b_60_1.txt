To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the two witnesses' testimonies and their abilities to judge a person's height. 

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- W1 as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller
- W2 as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We know that P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the first witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 or 80%.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can use this as our prior probability.

P(W1) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)

Here, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 or 85%, and P(W1|not A) is the probability that the first witness would claim the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the first witness's error rate, which is 0.2 or 20%.

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
= 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345 or 34.5%

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 34.5%.
