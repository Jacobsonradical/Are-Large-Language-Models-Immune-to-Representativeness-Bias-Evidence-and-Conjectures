Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which occurs with a probability of 15% if the attacker is chosen at random from the population.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when they say a person is 185 cm or taller, but they can also make mistakes.
4. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which occurs with a probability of 85% if the attacker is chosen at random from the population.
5. This witness is correct 70% of the time when they say a person is shorter than 185 cm, but they can also make mistakes.

Given these conditions, it's still more likely that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (85%) than 185 cm or taller (15%). But the first witness did claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% chance of being correct when they make that claim.

To calculate the final probability, we multiply the prior probability (the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8), giving us:

{probability: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12} 

So, after taking into account the witness's claim and their ability to judge height, there's still only about a 12% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
