Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time.

However, since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider the instances where the first witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. 

The probability that the first witness is correct when saying someone is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (or 80%). Therefore, the probability that the first witness is incorrect and the person is actually shorter than 185 cm is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 (or 20%).

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the second witness is correct when saying someone is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (or 85%).

Therefore, given that both witnesses have contradictory statements, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is the same as the probability that the first witness was correct, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, {probability: 0.8}
