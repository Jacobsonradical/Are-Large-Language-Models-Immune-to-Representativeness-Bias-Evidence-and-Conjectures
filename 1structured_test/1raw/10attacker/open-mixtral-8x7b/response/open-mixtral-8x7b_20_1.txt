Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony.

For the first witness, since they correctly identify the height 80% of the time and err 20% of the time, and since they claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we have:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 is correct) * P(population is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

For the second witness, since they correctly identify the height 70% of the time and err 30% of the time, and since they claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | witness 2's claim) = P(witness 2 is correct) * P(population is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.7 * 0.85
= 0.595

Since both witnesses made conflicting claims, we can combine their probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) * P(witness 1's claim) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 2's claim) * P(witness 2's claim)

Assuming both witnesses are equally likely to be believed, we have:

P(witness 1's claim) = P(witness 2's claim) = 0.5

Therefore,

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.12 * 0.5 + 0.595 * 0.5 = 0.3575

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
