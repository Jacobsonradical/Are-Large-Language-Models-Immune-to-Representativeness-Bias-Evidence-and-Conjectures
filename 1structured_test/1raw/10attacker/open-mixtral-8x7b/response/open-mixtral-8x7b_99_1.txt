Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when he claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know that he is correct 80% of the time. So, the probability he is correct in this case is also 0.8 (or 80%).

Next, we need to consider the second witness's testimony. She said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. We know she is correct 70% of the time. So, the probability she is correct in this case is 0.7 (or 70%).

Given that the second witness is correct and the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness would still claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since we know the first witness is wrong 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2 (or 20%).

Finally, we need to calculate the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where:
- P(A) is the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on city population statistics.
- P(B|A) is the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when claiming someone is 185 cm or taller).
- P(B) is the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller or that one would claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm while the other claims he is 185 cm or taller. This is calculated as follows:
  P(B) = [P(B and A) + P(B and not A)]
  = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
  = (0.8 * 0.15) + [P(B|not A) * 0.85]

We don't know P(B|not A) directly, but we calculated P(B|not A) * 0.85 earlier as the probability that the second witness would claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm while the first witness still claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. So, P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138 (or about 41.4% when rounded to two decimal places)

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.41, provided as a percentage (41%)}.
