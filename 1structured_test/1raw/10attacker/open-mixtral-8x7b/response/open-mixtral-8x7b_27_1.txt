Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different levels of accuracy in determining if someone is 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Given that the attacker was described as being 185 cm or taller by the first witness, we want to estimate the probability of this being true. To calculate this, we can use the likelihood ratio (LR) between the two hypotheses:
1. Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H1).
2. Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (H2).

We can calculate the likelihood ratio as follows:
LR = P(W1, W2 | H1) / P(W1, W2 | H2)

Where W1 and W2 are the statements of the two witnesses.

Now we need to calculate the probabilities for each hypothesis:

P(W1, W2 | H1) = P(W1=true|H1) * P(W2=true|H1) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56
P(W1, W2 | H2) = P(W1=true|H2) * P(W2=true|H2) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

LR = 0.56 / 0.06 ≈ 9.33

Now we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(H1|W1, W2) = LR * P(H1) / [LR * P(H1) + P(H2)]

Assuming equal priors for H1 and H2:
P(H1) = P(H2) = 0.5

P(H1|W1, W2) = 9.33 * 0.5 / [9.33 * 0.5 + 0.5] ≈ 0.93

{probability: 0.93}
