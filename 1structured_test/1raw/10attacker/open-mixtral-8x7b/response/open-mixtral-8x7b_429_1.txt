Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
b) The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.
c) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, let's consider both witnesses' statements.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(A) = 0.15 (given in the problem)

Let B be the event that the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.
P(B|A) = 0.8 (given in the problem)

Let C be the event that the second witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm.
P(C|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2 (given in the problem)

Let D be the event that the second witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller.
P(D|A') = 0.7 (given in the problem, where A' is the complement of A)

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

First, find P(B|A'):
P(B|A') = 1 - P(B|A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now, find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging these values back into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) = 0.3448275862068966

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3448, confidence: 0.95} (rounded to 3 decimal places, with a 95% confidence interval)
