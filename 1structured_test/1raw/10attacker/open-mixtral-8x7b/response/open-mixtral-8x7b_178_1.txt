Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution indicates that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We're looking for P(A|B), and we know P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the height is actually 185 cm or taller), P(A) = 0.15 (population distribution), and P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(B), we need to consider both cases where the height is 185 cm or taller and where it's not:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, based on the given information, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 or 34.5%.
