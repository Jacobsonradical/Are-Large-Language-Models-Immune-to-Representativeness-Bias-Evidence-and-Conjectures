To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We will consider the claims of both witnesses and the base rates of people's heights in the city.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 be the event that the first witness is correct in their claim.
Let W2 be the event that the second witness is correct in their claim.

We want to find P(A). According to the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2) + P(A|W1' and W2') * P(W1' and W2')

We are given:

P(W1) = 0.8
P(W1') = 0.2
P(W2) = 0.7
P(W2') = 0.3
P(A) (base rate) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to find the conditional probabilities.

P(W1|A) = probability that the first witness estimates correctly that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 1 (they made the claim)
P(W1'|A) = probability that the first witness estimates incorrectly that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

P(W2|A) = probability that the second witness estimates correctly that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.7 (they made the claim)
P(W2'|A) = probability that the second witness estimates incorrectly that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3

Using Bayes' rule, we can find the reverse conditional probabilities:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / (P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1'|A) * (1 - P(A))) = 1 * 0.15 / (1 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.333
P(A|W2) = P(W2|A) * P(A) / (P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W2'|A) * (1 - P(A))) = 0.7 * 0.15 / (0.7 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85) = 0.375

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses:

P(A) = P(A|W1) * P(W1) + P(A|W2) * P(W2) + P(A|W1' and W2') * P(W1' and W2')
     ≈ 0.333 * 0.8 + 0.375 * 0.7 + 0.15 (assuming P(A|W1' and W2') = 0.15, the base rate)
     ≈ 0.591
