Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8. We also need to calculate the probability of an attacker actually being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. The probability of both events happening can be calculated as the product of the two probabilities, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12, or 12%.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness made an error and incorrectly identified a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 20% or 0.2. We also need to calculate the probability of an attacker actually being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85. The probability of both events happening can be calculated as the product of the two probabilities, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17, or 17%.

Therefore, the total probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as the sum of the two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29, or 29%.

Answer: {probability: 0.29}
