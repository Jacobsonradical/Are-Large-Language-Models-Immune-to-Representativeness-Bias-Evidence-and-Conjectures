Given the information about the two witnesses' abilities to judge a person's height, we can calculate the likelihood of them being correct or incorrect. 

For the first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

- The probability of correctly identifying an 185 cm or taller person is 0.8 (80%).
- The probability of incorrectly identifying a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).

For the second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:

- The probability of correctly identifying a person shorter than 1
