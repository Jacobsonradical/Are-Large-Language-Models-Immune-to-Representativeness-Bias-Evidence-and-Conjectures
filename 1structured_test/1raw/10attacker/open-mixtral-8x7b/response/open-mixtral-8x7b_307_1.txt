Let's reason through the problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the testimony of two witnesses.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with 80% probability according to the information provided.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with 70% probability according to the information provided.
4. Since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time, we need to consider the probability that the first witness is correct AND the second witness is incorrect.
5. The probability that the first witness is correct is 0.8, and the probability that the second witness is incorrect is 0.3 (since she was correct 70% of the time, she was incorrect 30% of the time).
6. To find the probability that BOTH events occur, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.24}.
