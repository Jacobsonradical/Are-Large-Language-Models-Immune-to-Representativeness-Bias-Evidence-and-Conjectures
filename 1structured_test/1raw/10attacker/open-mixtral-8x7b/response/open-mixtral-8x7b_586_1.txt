Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information provided, 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller. So, the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement is 0.8 (or 80%).
4. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. Since we trust the first witness more, we can assume that the second witness is incorrect in this case.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is the same as the likelihood of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (or 80%).

So, {probability: 0.8}
