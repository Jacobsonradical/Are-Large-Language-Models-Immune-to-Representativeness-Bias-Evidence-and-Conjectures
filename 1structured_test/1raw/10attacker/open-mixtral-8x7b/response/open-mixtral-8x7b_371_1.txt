To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
W2: The second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
P(A): Probability of A
P(W1|A): Probability of W1 given A
P(W1|¬A): Probability of W1 given ¬A
P(A): Probability of A based on witness information

From the given information, we can calculate:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we want to find P(A|W1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

Since we want to compare P(A|W1) with P(¬A|W1), let's calculate the latter as well:

P(¬A|W1) = P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A) / P(W1)

Since P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A), we can calculate:

P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find P(A|W1) and P(¬A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.29) ≈ 0.345
P(¬A|W1) = (0.2)(0.85) / (0.29) ≈ 0.593

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, our estimate for the probability of this being true is:

{probability: 0.345}
