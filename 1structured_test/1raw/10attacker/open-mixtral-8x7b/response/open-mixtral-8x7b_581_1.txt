Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:
P(A) = 0.8 (probability of first witness correctly identifying someone 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:
P(B) = 0.7 (probability of second witness correctly identifying someone shorter than 185cm)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, we can calculate the probability of a random person being 185cm or taller:
P(C) = 0.15 (probability of a random person being 185cm or taller)

We want to find the probability of both witnesses being correct, which means the attacker is indeed 185cm or taller. This is equivalent to finding P(A ∩ B') (the event where the first witness is correct and the second is not) since they have contradictory statements.

Using the formula for conditional probability, P(A ∩ B') = P(A) * P(B'|A)

To find P(B'|A), we need to find the probability of the second witness being incorrect given that the first witness is correct. This happens when the first witness identifies someone as 185cm or taller but they are actually not. The first witness makes this error 20% of the time.

So, P(B'|A) = P(error in 2nd witness's statement) = 0.2

Therefore, P(A ∩ B') = P(A) * P(B'|A) = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.16}
