Let's reason through this:

We know that one witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and the other witness does so 70% of the time. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and we want to know the probability that this is correct.

The first witness's errors are split between calling someone who is taller than 185 cm as shorter than 185 cm (1 - 0.8 = 0.2), and calling someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (also 0.2).

The second witness's errors are split between calling someone who is taller than 185 cm as being exactly 185 cm (0.3), and calling someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm as being shorter than 185 cm (1 - 0.7 = 0.3).

Since the second witness agrees with the first witness that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, their testimonies are not in conflict. Therefore, we only need to consider the false positive rate of the first witness, which is 0.2 (20% of the time, the first witness calls someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).

However, we also need to take into account the base rate of how common people who are 185 cm or taller are in the population, which is 15% according to the information provided.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:
- A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the same as the first witness's accuracy, which is 0.8.
- P(A) is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and the witness being incorrect: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A), where ~A represents the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and P(B|~A) is the false positive rate, which is 0.2.

The calculation would be:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
