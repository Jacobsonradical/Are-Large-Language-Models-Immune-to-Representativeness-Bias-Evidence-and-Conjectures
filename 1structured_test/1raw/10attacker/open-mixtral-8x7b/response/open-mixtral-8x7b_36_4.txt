Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time.
2. The population distribution tells us that 15% of people are 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

- P(B|A) is the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is, which is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B) is the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which we can calculate as the sum of two probabilities: P(B and A) and P(B and not A).
  - P(B and A) is the probability of both events happening, which is 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct) times 0.15 (attacker is actually 185 cm or taller).
  - P(B and not A) is the probability of Witness 1 being incorrect while the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 (Witness 1 is incorrect) times 0.85 (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Calculating P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the conditional probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
