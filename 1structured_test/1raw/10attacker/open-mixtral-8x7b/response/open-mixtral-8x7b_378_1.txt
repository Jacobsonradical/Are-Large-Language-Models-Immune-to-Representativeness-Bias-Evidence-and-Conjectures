Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

Let's define two events:
- A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Using Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite this as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know P(B|A) from the first witness's accuracy, which is 80%. We know P(A) from the city's population distribution, which is 15%.

To find P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We don't know P(B|not A) directly, but we can find it using the second witness's accuracy. Let C be the complementary event of A, that is, the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B'|C), where B' is the complementary event of B, meaning the first witness does not claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Now, we can calculate P(B|not A):

P(B'|C) = 70% = P(C) since the second witness is correct 70% of the time when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm.

Thus, P(B|not A) = 1 - P(B'|C) = 30%.

Now, we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= 80% * 15% + 30% * 85%
= 12% + 25.5%
= 37.5%

Finally, we can find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= 80% * 15% / 37.5%
= 0.32 or 32%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.32 or 32%.
