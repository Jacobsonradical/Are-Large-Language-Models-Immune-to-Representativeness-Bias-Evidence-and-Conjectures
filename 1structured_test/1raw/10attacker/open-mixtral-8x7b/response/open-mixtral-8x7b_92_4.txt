Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) = P(first witness is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population)

P(first witness is correct) = 0.8
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population) = 0.15

So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
