Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in judging height. So, if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that witness 1 would correctly identify them as such.
3. However, witness 1 also has a 20% error rate. This means that even if the attacker was not 185 cm or taller, there's still a 20% chance that witness 1 would claim they were.
4. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we cannot rule out the possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.
5. Given that the second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm and has a 70% success rate, if the attacker was indeed shorter than 185 cm, there's a 70% chance that the second witness would correctly identify their height.
6. However, the second witness also has a 30% error rate, which means they might incorrectly claim the attacker was shorter than 185 cm even if they were actually 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

We want to find P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness 1's claim)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15

The probability of witness 1's claim can be calculated as:
P(witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1's claim | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using the given success rates and error rates for the witnesses, we can calculate:
P(witness 1's claim | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
P(witness 1's claim | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Substituting these values back into the equation for P(witness 1's claim):
P(witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.195

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given witness 1's claim:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.195 â‰ˆ 0.615

So, based on the given information, our estimate is:

{probability: 0.615}
