Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from both witnesses.
2. Since the two witnesses have different levels of accuracy, we can't simply take their statements at face value and combine them directly. Instead, we need to account for the probability that each witness is correct.
3. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time. So there's an 80% chance that the attacker really is 185 cm or taller if the first witness is to be believed.
4. However, the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time. This creates a contradiction, since both witnesses cannot be correct at the same time.
5. To resolve this, let's consider the scenario where the first witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and calculate the probability that the second witness would still claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm despite being wrong.
6. Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the second witness would be wrong 30% of the time (since their accuracy is 70%).
7. Therefore, the probability that both witnesses make contradictory statements about the attacker's height is the product of the first witness being correct and the second witness being wrong: 80% (first witness correct) * 30% (second witness wrong) = 0.24 or 24%.
8. This means that there's a 24% chance that the first witness is correct and the second witness is wrong about the attacker's height.

{probability: 0.24}
