Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we have to consider two mutually exclusive scenarios:
1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is correct.
2. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, but the first witness is incorrect.

Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time, we can calculate the probability of both scenarios happening.

Scenario 1:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and first witness is correct) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(first witness is correct)
= 0.15 * 0.8
= 0.12

Scenario 2:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and first witness is incorrect) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(first witness is incorrect)
= 0.15 * 0.2
= 0.03

Now, we add the probabilities of both scenarios:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and first witness is correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller and first witness is incorrect)
= 0.12 + 0.03
= 0.15

{probability: 0.15}
