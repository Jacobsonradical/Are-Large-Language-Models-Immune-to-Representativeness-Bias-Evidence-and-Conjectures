Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if a person is 185 cm or taller. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating if a person is shorter than 185 cm.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there are two possible scenarios:
1. The first witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate the probability of each scenario and then combine them to estimate the overall probability.

Scenario 1: The first witness is correct.
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness is correct) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy)

Scenario 2: The first witness is incorrect.
P(first witness is incorrect) = 1 - P(first witness is correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2
Given that the first witness is incorrect, the attacker must be shorter than 185 cm.
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | first witness is incorrect) = 1 (certain)
P(first witness is incorrect AND attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(first witness is incorrect) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | first witness is incorrect) = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2

Now, we can calculate the overall probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness is correct) * P(first witness is correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness is incorrect) * P(first witness is incorrect AND attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness is incorrect). We only know the distribution of heights in the city's population, but we don't know if the attacker is a random person from the city or if they share the same height distribution as the city's population.

Therefore, we cannot provide a precise probability estimate without making additional assumptions.

Format answer:
{probability: insufficient information to provide an accurate estimate}
