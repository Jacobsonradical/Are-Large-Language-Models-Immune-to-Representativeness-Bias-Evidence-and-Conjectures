Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in judging height.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate in judging height.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. This is a conditional probability, which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Here, A represents the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and B represents the event "the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

We are given:
- P(B|A): probability the first witness is correct, which is 80% or 0.8
- P(B|not A): probability the first witness errs, which is 20% or 0.2
- P(A): probability the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15

Now we can calculate the conditional probability:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * (1-0.15)))
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.03)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.15
P(A|B) = 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
