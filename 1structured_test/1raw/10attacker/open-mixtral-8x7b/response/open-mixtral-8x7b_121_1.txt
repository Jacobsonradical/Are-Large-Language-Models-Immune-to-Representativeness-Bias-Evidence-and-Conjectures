Let's analyze the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's denote A as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the first witness's accuracy, which is 80%.

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. This is given as 15% (from the city's population data).

P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
- P(B and A): the probability that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller and the first witness claims so.
- P(B and not A): the probability that the attacker's height is not actually 185 cm or taller but the first witness claims so.

P(B and A) = P(A) \* P(B|A) = 15% \* 80% = 12%

P(B and not A) = P(not A) \* P(B|not A) = 85% \* 20% = 17%

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 12% + 17% = 29%

Therefore, P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B) = 80% \* 15% / 29% = 34.5%

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 34.5%.
