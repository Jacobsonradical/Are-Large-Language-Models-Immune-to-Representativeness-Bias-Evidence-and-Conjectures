Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that one witness identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
2. We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (or 15%).
3. To find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

4. We are given P(B|A) (the accuracy of the first witness) as 0.8 and P(A) as 0.15. To find P(B), we need to find the probability of the first witness identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether they actually are that tall.
5. This can be calculated as the weighted average of the probabilities of the first witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are and when they aren't:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

where not A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(not A) is 0.85 (100% - 15%).

6. We know that the first witness identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 50% of the time, since 50% of the population is taller than 185 cm. However, they are only correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and they are incorrect 30% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.3 * 0.5 = 0.15 (30% of 50%).
7. Now we can calculate P(B):

P(B) = [0.8 * 0.15] + [0.15 * 0.85] = 0.12 + 0.1275 = 0.2475

8. Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

P(A|B) = [0.8 * 0.15] / 0.2475 â‰ˆ 0.485

{probability: 0.485}
