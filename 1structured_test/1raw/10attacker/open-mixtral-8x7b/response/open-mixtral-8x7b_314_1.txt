Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the first witness. This second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given these pieces of information, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct, meaning the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

The first witness being correct means either the attacker is naturally in the 15% who are 185 cm or taller, or the witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not.

The probability of the first scenario is simply 15% (0.15).

The probability of the second scenario is the product of the probability that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (85%, or 0.85), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (20%, or 0.2), and the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm (70%, or 0.7). This gives us 0.85 * 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.119.

Adding these two probabilities together gives us the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

So, {probability: 0.269, or 26.9%}.
