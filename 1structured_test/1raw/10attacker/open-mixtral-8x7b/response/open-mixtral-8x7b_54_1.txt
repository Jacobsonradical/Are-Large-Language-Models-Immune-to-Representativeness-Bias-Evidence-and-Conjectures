Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness is incorrect when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate this probability as follows:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

where A is the event that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the second witness is incorrect when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.8.

We are also given that the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B) = 0.3.

Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness is incorrect when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:

P(A and not B) = P(A) + P(not B) - P(A and B)
= 0.8 + 0.7 - 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.94

However, we are not done yet, as we need to take into account the base rates of the population. We are given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the final probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness claims so)
= P(first witness is correct and attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(first witness is correct)
= 0.94 * 0.15 / (0.94 * 0.15 + 0.64 * 0.85)
= 0.135

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.135.
