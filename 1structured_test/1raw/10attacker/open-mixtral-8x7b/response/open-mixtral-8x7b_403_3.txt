Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it means that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.

Given this information, we can calculate the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller:
P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm) = 0.8

We also need to calculate the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm:
P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is NOT 185 cm) = 0.2 (this is the error rate for identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness says 185 cm) = [P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm) * P(attacker is 185 cm)] / P(witness says 185 cm)

We don't know the prior probability P(attacker is 185 cm), but since we're looking for a probability and not a specific number, we can simplify Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness says 185 cm) ∝ P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm) * P(attacker is 185 cm)

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the prior probability P(attacker is 185 cm) to be 0.15. Therefore:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness says 185 cm) ∝ 0.8 * 0.15

Now, we need to calculate the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This is the sum of the probabilities of two scenarios:
1. The attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies them as such.
2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness mistakenly identifies them as 185 cm or taller.

P(witness says 185 cm) = P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is 185 cm) * P(attacker is 185 cm) + P(witness says 185 cm | attacker is NOT 185 cm) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:

P(witness says 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can find the posterior probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm | witness says 185 cm) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
