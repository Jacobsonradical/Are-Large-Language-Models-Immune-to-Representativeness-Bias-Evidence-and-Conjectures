Let's analyze the given information:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Since we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim, we will use the first witness's accuracy to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The event that the first witness correctly claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We are given:
P(W1|A) = 80% = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

To calculate P(W1), we need to consider two possibilities:
- W1 ∩ A: The first witness correctly claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1 ∩ A': The first witness incorrectly claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, but they are not

We have:
P(W1 ∩ A) = P(W1|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
P(W1 ∩ A') = P(W1|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Now, we can find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller:
P(W1) = P(W1 ∩ A) + P(W1 ∩ A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|W1), the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 ≈ 0.345

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
