Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. According to the information, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability).
3. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
4. The first witness's statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller would be more reliable if the witness is correct. Therefore, we should multiply the prior probability by the witness's accuracy to find the posterior probability.

The calculation would be: 15% * 80% = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
