Let's first calculate the independent probability of each witness being correct:

P(W1 true) = probability that the first witness is correct when saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80

P(W2 true) = probability that the second witness is correct when saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.70

Now, since these are independent events, we can calculate the overall probability of both events happening:
