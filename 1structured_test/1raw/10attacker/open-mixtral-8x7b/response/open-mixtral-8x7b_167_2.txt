Let's reason through this problem:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. This is a problem of conditional probability.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time, and the population distribution tells us that 15% of the people are 185 cm or taller. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Here, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, which is 80%.

P(A) is the probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

P(B) is the probability that the first witness says a random person is 185 cm or taller. This is a bit more complex to calculate because the witness is sometimes wrong. If we imagine that the witness is equally likely to say someone is 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height, then P(B) is the weighted average of the witness's accuracy for each height category:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Here, not A is the event that the person is shorter than 185 cm, which has a probability of 85% based on the population distribution. The probability that the witness says a person is 185 cm or taller when they are not, P(B|not A), is the complement of the witness's accuracy for the shorter-than-185-cm category, or 100% - 70% = 30%.

So:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.30 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now we can calculate the conditional probability:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

Therefore, our estimate is:
{probability: 0.32}
