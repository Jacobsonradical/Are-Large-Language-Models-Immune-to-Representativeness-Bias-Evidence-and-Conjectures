To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events. Let's denote the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller as B. Then, Bayes' theorem states:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)

We are given P(A|B) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller), and P(B) can be obtained from the information about the city's population, which is 0.15.

To calculate P(A), we need to consider two possibilities: the first witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the first witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability to calculate P(A):

P(A) = P(A|B) * P(B) + P(A|not B) * P(not B)

We are given P(A|B), and we can calculate P(not B) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85. To find P(A|not B), we need to consider the second scenario, when the first witness is incorrect and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This occurs when the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller, which happens with a probability of 0.2 (from the information about the second witness).

Now we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.38

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.38}
