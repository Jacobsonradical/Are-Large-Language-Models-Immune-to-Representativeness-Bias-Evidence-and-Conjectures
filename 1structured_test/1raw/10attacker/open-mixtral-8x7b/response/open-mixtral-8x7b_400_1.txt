Let's reason through this:

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

The first witness claims this with a reliability of 80%, but this reliability is not conditional on the actual height of the attacker. It's possible that the witness is more likely to overestimate height, for example, which would make their testimony less reliable when the true height is shorter than 185 cm.

However, without more information about any systematic bias in the witnesses' estimations, we have to assume that their reliability is the same regardless of the actual height.

So, we'll estimate the probability as the witness's reliability, which is 80%.

Answer: {probability: 0.8}
