Let's analyze the information given and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Since the population is split evenly between people shorter and taller than 185 cm, this implies that the witness agrees with the person's height 80% of the time (when the person is actually taller or shorter than 185 cm) and disagrees 20% of the time. So, the witness's statement has a 0.8 probability of being correct, regardless of whether the person is actually taller or shorter than 1
