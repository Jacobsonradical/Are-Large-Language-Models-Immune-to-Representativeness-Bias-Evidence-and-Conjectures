Let's reason through this:

1. We know that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
2. We know that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
3. From this, we can infer that if both witnesses are correct, then the attacker must be 185 cm or taller.
4. The probability of both witnesses being correct can be calculated as follows:
   - The probability of Witness 1 being correct is 0.8.
   - Given that Witness 1 is correct, the probability of Witness 2 being correct is the probability that a randomly chosen person is actually shorter than 185 cm (which is 85%, or 0.85), multiplied by the probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being taller than 185 cm (which is 0.3, or 30%). This gives us a probability of 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255.
   - Therefore, the probability of both witnesses being correct is 0.8 * 0.255 = 0.204.

{probability: 0.204}
