Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. This is a conditional probability, which we can write as P(A|B), where A is the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and B is the event "first witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller".

2. To calculate this, we need to know the overall probability of a randomly chosen person from the city being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.

3. We also have the accuracy rates of the two witnesses. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights, and incorrect 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.

4. Given that the second witness said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but we know the second witness is only correct 70% of the time, there's still a chance that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.

5. To calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement, we can use Bayes' theorem: 

   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

6. Plugging in our values:

   P(B|A) is the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.
   P(A) is the overall probability of a randomly chosen person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
   P(B|not A) is the accuracy of the first witness when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (since the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time).
   P(not A) is the overall probability of a randomly chosen person not being 185 cm or taller, which is 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

7. Calculating P(A|B):

   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.8 * 0.85)) = 0.09 / (0.09 + 0.68) = 0.09 / 0.77 â‰ˆ 0.1169 (11.69%).

So, {probability: 0.1169} or approximately 11.69%.
