Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of each witness being correct:

P(W1 corr) = Probability that the first witness is correct = 0.8
P(W2 corr) = Probability that the second witness is correct = 0.7

Given that the first witness thinks the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we want to calculate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. We can do this by calculating the probability that both witnesses are correct, given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(W1 corr and W2 corr) / P(W1 corr)

To calculate this, we need to consider the four possible scenarios:
1. Both witnesses are correct
2. Both witnesses are incorrect
3. First witness is correct, second is incorrect
4. First witness is incorrect, second is correct

Given the information, we can calculate the probabilities for these scenarios:

Scenario 1: Both correct
P(W1 corr and W2 corr) = P(W1 corr) * P(W2 corr) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

Scenario 2: Both incorrect
P(W1 incorrect and W2 incorrect) = P(W1 incorrect) * P(W2 incorrect)
P(W1 incorrect) = 1 - P(W1 corr) = 0.2
P(W2 incorrect) = 1 - P(W2 corr) = 0.3
P(W1 incorrect and W2 incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Scenario 3: First correct, second incorrect
P(W1 correct and W2 incorrect) = P(W1 corr) * P(W2 incorrect) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

Scenario 4: First incorrect, second correct
P(W1 incorrect and W2 correct) = P(W1 incorrect) * P(W2 correct) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims this:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(W1 corr and W2 corr) / P(W1 corr) = 0.56 / 0.8 = 0.7

Additionally, given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 - P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can combine these probabilities:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 claims 185 cm or taller) = P(W1 corr and W2 corr) / P(W1 corr) = (P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(W1 corr and W2 corr | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(W1 corr)

Substituting our calculated probabilities:

0.7 = (0.15 * 0.56) / 0.8

Solving for the prior probability, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.1875

So our estimate for the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.1875}
