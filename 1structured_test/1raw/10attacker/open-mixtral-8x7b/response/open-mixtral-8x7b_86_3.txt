Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' statements seem to be independent, we can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem.
3. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
6. We know P(B|A) from the first witness's ability to judge a person's height correctly (0.8), and P(A) from the city's population data (0.15).
7. To find P(B), we need to consider two cases: the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   a. P(B|A) * P(A) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
   b. P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
   c. P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A') = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
8. Now we can find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
