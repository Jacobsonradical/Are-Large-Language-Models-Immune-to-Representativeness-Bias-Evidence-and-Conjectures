Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies a person as such 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies a person as such 30% of the time.
4. Since both witnesses contradict each other, one of them must be wrong.
5. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness.

Given these conditions, we can calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller. This is the product of the probability that the first witness says the person is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 because they're correct 80% of the time), and the probability that the second witness says the person is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.7 because they're correct 70% of the time).

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56, or 56%}
