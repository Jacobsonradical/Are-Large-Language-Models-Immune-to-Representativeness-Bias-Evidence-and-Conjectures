Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. According to the first witness, the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which happens to be true 80% of the time when this witness makes a judgment under similar conditions.
3. According to the second witness, the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is true 70% of the time when this witness makes a judgment under similar conditions.
4. Since one witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other claims the opposite, we can consider these two pieces of evidence as conflicting.
5. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the likelihood ratio of the two pieces of evidence.
6. The likelihood ratio is the probability of observing the evidence if the attacker is 185 cm or taller divided by the probability of observing the evidence if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
7. For the first witness, the likelihood ratio is 0.8 (probability of being correct) divided by 0.2 (probability of being incorrect) = 4.
8. For the second witness, the likelihood ratio is 0.3 (probability of being correct) divided by 0.7 (probability of being incorrect) = 0.42857.
9. To combine the likelihood ratios, we multiply them: 4 * 0.42857 ≈ 1.7143.
10. Since the product is greater than 1, it suggests that the first witness's claim is more likely to be true.

{probability: 1.7143 / (1 + 1.7143) ≈ 0.6322}
