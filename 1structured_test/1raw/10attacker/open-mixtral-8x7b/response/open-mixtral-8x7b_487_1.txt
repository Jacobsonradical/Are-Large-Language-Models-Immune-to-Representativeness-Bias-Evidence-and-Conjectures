Let's break down the given information:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and mistaken 20% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
The second witness is correct 70% of the time and mistaken 30% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

However, the information about the population distribution doesn't seem to be directly helpful in estimating the attacker's height. Instead, we can focus on the reliability of the witnesses and their estimates.

The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, but we don't know if this claim is correct or not. Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller as 0.8 (80%).

{probability: 0.8}
