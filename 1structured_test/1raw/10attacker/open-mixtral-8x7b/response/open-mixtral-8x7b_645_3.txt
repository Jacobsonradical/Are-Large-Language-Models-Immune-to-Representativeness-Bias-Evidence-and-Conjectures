Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in determining height.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate in determining height.

Given these conditions, we need to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim.

We can calculate the probability using Bayes' theorem, which is:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

We know:
- P(B|A): The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.
- P(A): 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Now, we need to calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

We know:
- P(B and A): The probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifies them as such. This is P(B|A) * P(A) = (0.8) * (0.15) = 0.12.
- P(B and not A): The probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller but the first witness incorrectly identifies them as such. This is P(B|not A) * P(not A) = (0.2) * (0.85) = 0.17.

Now, we can calculate P(B):
P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B) = (0.8) * (0.15) / (0.29) â‰ˆ 0.345.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.345.
