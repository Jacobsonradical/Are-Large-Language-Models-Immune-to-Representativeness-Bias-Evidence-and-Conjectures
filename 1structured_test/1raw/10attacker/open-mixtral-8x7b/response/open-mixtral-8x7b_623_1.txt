Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is consistent with the attacker being in the taller group (15% of the population).
3. However, Witness 1 makes mistakes 20% of the time, so their claim may not be accurate.
4. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is inconsistent with the attacker being in the taller group.
5. Witness 2 makes mistakes 30% of the time, so they could be wrong as well.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim and their error rate:
- The probability that Witness 1 is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (their accuracy rate).
- The probability that Witness 1 is incorrect when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (their error rate).
- Given that Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker actually was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (the base rate of 15%) divided by (0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85), which equals approximately 0.315 (31.5%).

{probability: 0.315}
