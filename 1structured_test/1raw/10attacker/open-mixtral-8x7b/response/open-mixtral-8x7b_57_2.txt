Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating if someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can set up a probability tree.
3. The first branch represents the first witness being correct, which has a probability of 0.8 (80%). The second branch represents the first witness being incorrect, which has a probability of 0.2 (20%).
4. Under the condition that the first witness is correct (0.8 probability), the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller is a certainty.
5. Under the condition that the first witness is incorrect (0.2 probability), we need to consider the possibility that the second witness is correct about the attacker being shorter than 185 cm (0.7 probability) and the possibility that the second witness is also incorrect (0.3 probability).
6. However, since the second witness's claim contradicts the first witness's claim, we can exclude the scenario where the second witness is incorrect because it would mean both witnesses made a mistake in opposite directions, an unlikely coincidence.
7. Therefore, the only scenario we need to consider under the condition of the first witness being incorrect is the second witness being correct, which has a probability of 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 (14%).
8. To find the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we need to multiply the probabilities of this happening under each condition and sum them up: (0.8 * 1) + (0.2 * 0.14) = 0.8 + 0.028 = 0.828.

{probability: 0.828}
