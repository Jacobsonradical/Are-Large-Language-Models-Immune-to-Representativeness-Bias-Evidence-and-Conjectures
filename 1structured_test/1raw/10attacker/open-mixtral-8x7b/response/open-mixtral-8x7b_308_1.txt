Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which occurs with a frequency of 15% in the general population.
3. However, Witness 1 makes errors 20% of the time when estimating heights. So, when they say the person is 185 cm or taller, it could also include people who are actually shorter than 185 cm.
4. When Witness 1 says the person is 185 cm or taller, this corresponds to two possibilities: the person is actually 185 cm or taller (15% of the population), or the witness is mistaken and the person is actually shorter than 185 cm (80% of the time when the witness says so, or 12% of the population).
5. Therefore, given that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller is a combination of the true positives and the false positives, which is 15% + 12% = 27%.

So, {probability: 0.27}
