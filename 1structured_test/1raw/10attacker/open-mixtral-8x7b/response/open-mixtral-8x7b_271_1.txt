Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. Since the two witnesses' assessments are independent, we can calculate the probability of both statements being correct and multiply them together.
3. The probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the probability of the second witness being incorrect is 0.3 (given that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm).
4. The probability of both events happening is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.
5. However, we also need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15 (15%).
6. We can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that both witnesses made their statements.
7. We have P(B|A) = 0.24, P(A) = 0.15, and we need to find P(B), which is the total probability of both witnesses making their statements.
8. The first witness is correct with a probability of 0.8, and the second witness is correct with a probability of 0.7, so the probability of both being correct is 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
9. The probability of both witnesses being incorrect is 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06.
10. Therefore, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.24 + 0.06 = 0.3.
11. Now we can calculate the posterior probability: P(A|B) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.12.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12.
