Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. There are two witnesses with different assessments.
3. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with 80% probability and incorrect with 20% probability.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with 70% probability and incorrect with 30% probability.
5. The two claims are mutually exclusive, so we can use the law of total probability to find the probability that the attacker is 1
