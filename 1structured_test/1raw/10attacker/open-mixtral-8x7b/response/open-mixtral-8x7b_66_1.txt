Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, but we're trying to estimate the probability that the first witness is correct, i.e., the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Given these conditions, we can estimate the probability as follows:

Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = Probability that both witnesses are correct or the first witness is correct and the second is not

This can be calculated as:
P(A or B') = P(A) + P(B')
= 0.15 * 0.8 (probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller AND the first witness being correct)
+ 0.85 * 0.2 (probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm AND the first witness being correct)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.29}.
