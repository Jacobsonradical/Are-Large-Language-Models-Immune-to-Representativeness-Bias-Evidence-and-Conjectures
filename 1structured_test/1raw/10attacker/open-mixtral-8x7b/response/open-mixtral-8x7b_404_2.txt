Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct according to their claims and then multiply the probabilities of their claims.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = 0.8 (80% correct)
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2) = 1 - 0.7 (30% incorrect) = 0.3

Now we multiply these probabilities:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are correct) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2)
= 0.8 * 0.3
= 0.24

However, we also need to consider the base rate of attackers being 185 cm or taller, which is 15%. So, we calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are correct) / P(Both witnesses are correct)

To calculate P(Both witnesses are correct), we need to consider all the possibilities of both witnesses being correct:

Scenario 1: Attacker is 185 cm or taller, and both witnesses are correct:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are correct) = 0.24

Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and both witnesses are incorrect:
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 1) = 1 - 0.8 (20% incorrect) = 0.2
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) = 1 - 0.7 (30% incorrect) = 0.3
P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm and both witnesses are incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06

Now, we calculate P(Both witnesses are correct):
P(Both witnesses are correct) = P(Scenario 1) + P(Scenario 2)
= 0.24 + 0.06
= 0.3

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 and Witness 2) = P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller and both witnesses are correct) / P(Both witnesses are correct)
= 0.24 / 0.3
= 0.8

{probability: 0.8}
