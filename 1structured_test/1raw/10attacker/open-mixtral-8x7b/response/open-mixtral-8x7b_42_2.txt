Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying a person is 185 cm or taller, and when the person actually is 185 cm or taller: P(Correct and Tall) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is incorrect when saying a person is 185 cm or taller, and when the person actually is not 185 cm or taller: P(Incorrect and Tall) = 0.2

Now, let's use the given information that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the probability that a person is actually 185 cm or taller: P(Tall) = 0.15

Similarly, let's calculate the probability that a person is not 185 cm or taller: P(Not Tall) = 1 - P(Tall) = 0.85

Now, let's calculate the probability that the first witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, and the person actually is 185 cm or taller:
P(Witness Says Tall | Actually Tall) = P(Correct and Tall) = 0.8

We can also calculate the probability that the first witness says a person is 185 cm or taller, and the person actually is not 185 cm or taller:
P(Witness Says Tall | Actually Not Tall) = P(Incorrect and Tall) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:
P(Actually Tall | Witness Says Tall) = P(Witness Says Tall and Actually Tall) / P(Witness Says Tall)
= P(Witness Says Tall | Actually Tall) * P(Actually Tall) / (P(Witness Says Tall | Actually Tall) * P(Actually Tall) + P(Witness Says Tall | Actually Not Tall) * P(Actually Not Tall))
= (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.17 * 0.85))
= 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.1445)
