Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To do this, let's consider the two scenarios:
1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We'll calculate the probabilities of these scenarios based on the information provided, and then use Bayes' theorem to find our final estimate.

Scenario 1: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct in this scenario.
- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is incorrect in this scenario.

Scenario 2: The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is incorrect in this scenario.
- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is correct in this scenario.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities for each scenario:

P(A|S1) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given scenario 1
= 1 (since the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller in this scenario)

P(B|S1) = Probability of the first witness correctly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given scenario 1
= 0.8 (first witness's accuracy)

P(C|S1) = Probability of the second witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given scenario 1
= 0.3 (second witness's error rate)

P(A|S2) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given scenario 2
= 0 (since the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm in this scenario)

P(B|S2) = Probability of the first witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given scenario 2
= 0.2 (first witness's error rate)

P(C|S2) = Probability of the second witness correctly claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given scenario 2
= 0.7 (second witness's accuracy)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find our estimate:

P(S1|B,C) = Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so and the second witness claims the opposite
= [P(B|S1) * P(C|S1) * P(S1)] / [P(B|S1) * P(C|S1) * P(S1) + P(B|S2) * P(C|S2) * P(S2)]

We know that P(S1) = 0.15 (15% of the population) and P(S2) = 0.85 (85% of the population). Substituting these values and the other probabilities calculated above, we get:

P(S1|B,C) â‰ˆ 0.292

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.292}
