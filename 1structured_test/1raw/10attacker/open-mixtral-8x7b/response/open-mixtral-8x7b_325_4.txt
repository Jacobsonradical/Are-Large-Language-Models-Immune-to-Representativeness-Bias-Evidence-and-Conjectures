Let's reason through this:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating whether someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. The population of the city is such that 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm.
3. The first witness's estimate of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller could be accurate or inaccurate.

Let's calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement:

P(taller | witness1) = P(witness1 is correct) * P(taller) + P(witness1 is incorrect) * P(not taller)
= (0.8) * (0.15) + (1 - 0.8) * (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.21
= 0.33

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.33.
