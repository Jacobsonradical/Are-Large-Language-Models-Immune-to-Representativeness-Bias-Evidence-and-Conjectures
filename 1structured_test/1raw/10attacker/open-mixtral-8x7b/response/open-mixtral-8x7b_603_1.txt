Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Since we have two conflicting witness reports, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our initial belief (from statement a) with the new evidence from the witnesses.
3. Bayes' theorem formula: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
4. In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller", and event B is "given the witness reports".
5. Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can apply the formula separately for each witness and then combine the results.
6. For the first witness, P(B|A) = 0.8 (they correctly identified the height 80% of the time), and P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller).
7. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B), the overall probability of observing the first witness's statement.
8. Instead, let's compare the two possible outcomes for the first witness: if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, the first witness would have made the correct statement with a probability of 0.8. If the attacker was not 185 cm or taller, the first witness would have still made the incorrect statement with a probability of 0.2.
9. Similarly, for the second witness, P(B|A) = 0.3 (they incorrectly identified the height 30% of the time), and P(A) remains the same at 0.15.
10. Comparing the two possible outcomes for the second witness, the probability of them making the correct statement (given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.3, and the probability of them making the incorrect statement (given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller) is 0.7.
11. Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to find the combined probability of both testimonies.
12. The combined probability of both testimonies being correct is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 (24%).
13. However, this combined probability is not very useful since we don't have enough information to calculate the prior probabilities or the overall probabilities for each witness.
14. Given the conflicting testimonies and the limited information available, we cannot provide a precise estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement alone.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific probability estimate in the requested format.
