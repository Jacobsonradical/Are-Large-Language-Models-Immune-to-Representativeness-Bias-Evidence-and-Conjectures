Let's reason through this problem:

1. We have two witnesses with different abilities to estimate a person's height.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
4. To estimate the probability that Witness 1 is correct, we can multiply the likelihood of Witness 1 being correct (0.8) with the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city's population (0.15).
5. Similarly, to estimate the probability that Witness 2 is correct, we can multiply the likelihood of Witness 2 being correct (0.7) with the base rate of people who are shorter than 1
