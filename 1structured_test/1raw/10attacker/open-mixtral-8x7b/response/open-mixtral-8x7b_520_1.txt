Let's break down the information given and reason through it.

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. To calculate this, we can use the law of total probability, which states that the probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of that event given each mutually exclusive condition, multiplied by the probability of that condition.

In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the conditions are the first witness being correct or incorrect. We can represent this as:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness correct) * P(first witness correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness incorrect) * P(first witness incorrect)

Given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, let's calculate the probability of the first witness being correct, which is the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller. Based on the information provided, this probability is 0.15.

Now, let's calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller: P(first witness correct) = 0.8.

Similarly, we can calculate P(first witness incorrect) = 1 - P(first witness correct) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.

However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness incorrect), because we don't know the first witness's error rate when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, we cannot provide an accurate estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. If more information were given about the first witness's error rate when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, we could calculate a more accurate estimate.
