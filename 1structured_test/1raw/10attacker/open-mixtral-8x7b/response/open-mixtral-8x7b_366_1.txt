Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a case of dependent testimonies, so we cannot simply multiply the accuracy rates of the two witnesses.
3. Instead, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this case would look like:
   P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]
   where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

4. From the information given, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), and P(not A) = 0.85.
5. We also know that P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the true height is 185 cm or taller), and P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate when the true height is less than 185 cm).
6. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
   P(A|B) = [(0.8)*(0.15)] / [((0.8)*(0.15)) + ((0.2)*(0.85))]

Calculating the above expression, we get:
{probability: 0.392, rounded to two decimal places}
