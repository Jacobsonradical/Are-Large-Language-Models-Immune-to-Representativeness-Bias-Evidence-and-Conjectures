Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time when identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, there are two possible scenarios:
1. Witness 1 is correct (80% probability)
2. Witness 1 is incorrect (20% probability)

We don't have enough information to determine whether Witness 1 was correct in this specific case, but we can combine the witness's reliability with the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller to estimate an overall probability.

To calculate this, we can use the formula:

P(A | B) = (P(B | A) * P(A)) / (P(B | A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A))

Where:
A represents the event "The attacker is 185 cm or taller"
B represents the event "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller"

Plugging in the values:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B | A) = 0.8 (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone 185 cm or taller)
P(B | not A) = 0.2 (Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when identifying someone shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A | B):

P(A | B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A | B) â‰ˆ 0.36

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.36}
