Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller AND attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller)

From the problem statement, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, we get:
