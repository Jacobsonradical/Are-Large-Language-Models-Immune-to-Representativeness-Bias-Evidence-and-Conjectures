Let's break down the problem and calculate the probabilities:

1. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens with 15% probability according to statement (a).
2. However, we also have testimony from two witnesses. According to statement (b), the first witness is correct 80% of the time. So, we need to adjust our initial probability based on this information.
3. The likelihood that both witnesses are correct is 0.15 (initial probability) * 0.8 (first witness accuracy) = 0.12 or 12%.
4. Now, let's consider the possibility that the first witness is incorrect (20% chance) and the second witness is correct (70% chance). In this case, the attacker would be shorter than 185 cm, but both witnesses claim he is taller. The probability for this scenario is 0.85 (100% - 15% from statement a) * 0.2 (first witness error) * 0.7 (second witness accuracy) = 0.119 or 11.9%.
5. To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, we add both probabilities: 12% + 11.9% = 23.9%.

So, our estimate is: {probability: 0.239}
