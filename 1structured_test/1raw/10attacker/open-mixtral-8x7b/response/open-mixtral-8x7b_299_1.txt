Let's first calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to each witness's testimony, assuming they are fully accurate.

For the first witness, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability is 0.15 if they are accurate. However, we know that the first witness is only correct 80% of the time, so we need to account for their error rate. This means that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to the first witness, is 0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.8) * 0 = 0.12 (or 12%) because when the witness is wrong, we assume the attacker's height follows the population distribution.

For the second witness, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability is 0.85 if they are accurate. But the second witness is correct only 70% of the time. So, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, according to the second witness, is 0.15 * 0.3 + (1 - 0.3) * 0 = 0.09 (or 9%) because when the witness is wrong, we assume the attacker's height follows the population distribution.

Since both witnesses' testimonies cannot be true at the same time, we need to choose one of their statements. Given their error rates, the first witness's claim of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is more likely than the second witness's claim.
