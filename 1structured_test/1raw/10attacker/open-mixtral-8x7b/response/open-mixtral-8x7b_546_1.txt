Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that there are two witnesses with different estimates of the attacker's height.
2. The first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time.
3. The second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time.
4. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, it might seem like the first witness is more likely to be correct. However, we need to consider both witnesses' accounts together.

Let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect, as both statements cannot be true at the same time:

P(185 cm) = P(185 cm | Witness1) * P(Witness1) * P(not Witness2 | 185 cm)

We're interested in the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. To calculate this, we need to determine the probability that the first witness is correct and that the second witness is incorrect, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness1) = 0.5 (as there's a 50% chance the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(not Witness2 | 185 cm) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Now, we need to calculate P(185 cm | Witness1):

There are two possible scenarios for the first witness: being correct or incorrect. The probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8, and the total probability for the first witness is 1.

P(185 cm | Witness1) = P(Witness1 | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) / P(Witness1)

Since the total probability of the first witness being correct or incorrect is 1, we can say:

P(Witness1 | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) + P(not Witness1 | 185 cm) * P(185 cm) = 1

We know that:
P(Witness1 | 185 cm) = 0.8
P(not Witness1 | 185 cm) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

So,
0.8 * P(185 cm) + 0.2 * P(185 cm) = 1
1 * P(185 cm) = 1
P(185 cm) = 1

Now we can calculate the final probability:

P(185 cm) = P(185 cm | Witness1) * P(Witness1) * P(not Witness2 | 185 cm)
P(185 cm) = 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.3
P(185 cm) = 0.12

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
