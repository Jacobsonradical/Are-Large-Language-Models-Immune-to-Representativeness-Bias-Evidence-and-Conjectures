Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Let's denote this probability as P(A|B), where A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B is the available information.
3. From witness 1, we have that P(B1|A) = 0.8, which means the probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
4. Similarly, from witness 1, we have that P(B1|not A) = 0.2, which means the probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
5. From witness 2, we have that P(B2|A) = 0.7, which means the probability of witness 2 saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.3.
6. From witness 2, we have that P(B2|not A) = 0.7, which means the probability of witness 2 saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller is 0.7.
7. We can now calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
   P(A|B) = P(B1 and B2|A) * P(A) / P(B1 and B2)
   We know that P(B1 and B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56 (both witnesses say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
   We also know that P(B1 and B2|not A) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (both witnesses say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller)
   We can assume that P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the city's population)
   We can calculate P(B1 and B2) = P(B1 and B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1 and B2|not A) * (1-P(A)) = 0.56*0.15 + 0.06*0.85 = 0.108
   Therefore, P(A|B) = 0.56 * 0.15 / 0.108 â‰ˆ 0.7963
