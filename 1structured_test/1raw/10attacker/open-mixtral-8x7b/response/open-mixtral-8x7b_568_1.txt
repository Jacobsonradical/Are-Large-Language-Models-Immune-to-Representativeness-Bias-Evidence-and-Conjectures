To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from both witnesses and the population statistics.

First, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80%).

Next, let's calculate the probability that the second witness is correct when saying that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as 0.7 (70%).

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the first witness is incorrect when saying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%).

We can now calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct, which means the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given by the product of the two probabilities: 0.8 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.68 or 68%.

However, this is not the final answer. We also need to consider the probability that the second witness is incorrect (i.e., the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the first witness is correct (i.e., the first witness's error rate when saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller). This probability is given by: 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.03 or 3%.

The final estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is the sum of these two probabilities: 68% + 3% = 71%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.71, or 71%}.
