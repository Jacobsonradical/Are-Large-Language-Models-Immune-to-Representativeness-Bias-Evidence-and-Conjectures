Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
3. The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which means their statement contradicts the first witness.
4. So, there are two possibilities: either the first witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or the second witness is correct and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
5. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%.
6. To calculate the posterior probability, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
7. In our case, A is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) is the accuracy of the first witness (0.8), and P(A) is the prior probability (0.15).
8. However, we don't have enough information to calculate P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height.
9. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without more information.

I'd be happy to revise my answer if you can provide the necessary probability P(B).

In the meantime, I will provide an answer assuming that P(B) is the same for both heights, so that the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller is simply the product of the accuracy of the first witness and the prior probability:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.15, or 0.12}
