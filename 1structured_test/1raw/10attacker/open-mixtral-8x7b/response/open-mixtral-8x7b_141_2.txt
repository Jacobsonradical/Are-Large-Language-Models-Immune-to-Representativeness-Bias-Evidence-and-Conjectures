Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll consider the scenario where the first witness is correct.

To calculate the probability, we need to find the probability of the first witness being correct and the second witness being incorrect. The first witness being correct has a probability of 0.8 (80%). The second witness being incorrect has a probability of 0.3 (30%), as they are correct 70% of the time when estimating a person as shorter than 185 cm.

Now, we need to find the probability of both events happening simultaneously. Since the two events are independent, we can calculate the probability of them both happening by multiplying their individual probabilities:

Probability = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
