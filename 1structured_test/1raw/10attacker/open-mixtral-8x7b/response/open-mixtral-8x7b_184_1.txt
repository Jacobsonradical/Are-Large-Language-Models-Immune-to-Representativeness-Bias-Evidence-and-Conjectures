Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm. We will then multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability that both witnesses' claims are correct.

P(1st witness correct) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(2nd witness correct) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

However, we also need to consider the base rates of people's heights in the city, as mentioned in part b:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm (P(short)) = 0.85
- 15% of the population is 185cm or taller (P(tall)) = 0.15

To calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate:
P(1st witness correct | attacker is tall) = P(1st witness correct) * P(tall) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12

Now, to calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm, we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the base rate:
P(2nd witness correct | attacker is short) = P(2nd witness correct) * P(short) = 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595

Finally, we want to know the probability that the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(attacker is tall | 1st witness claims tall) = P(1st witness correct | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(1st witness correct)
= 0.12 * 0.15 / (0.12 * 0.15 + 0.595 * 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.0325

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.0325}
