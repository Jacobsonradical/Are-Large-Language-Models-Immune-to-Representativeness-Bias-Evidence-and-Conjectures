Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1, who thinks the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
3. Witness 2, who thinks the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed so. To do this, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

In our case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We have P(A) = 0.15 (15% chance that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find P(B|A), the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Now we need to find P(B), which is the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15. We need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as the false positive rate: 1 - 0.7 (witness 2's accuracy) = 0.3. Finally, P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

So P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 â‰ˆ 0.32

So our estimate is:

{probability: 0.32}
