Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed. To do this, we'll calculate the probability of this scenario based on the information provided about the witnesses' reliability.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as Witness 1 claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
