Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses with different claims about the attacker's height. To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can consider the reliability of each witness and the population statistics.

1. Witness 1: The first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This witness is correct 80% of the time when making such a claim.
2. Witness 2: The second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. This witness is correct 70% of the time when making that claim.
3. Population: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct in their claims, given their individual reliabilities and the population statistics. The probability that Witness 1 is correct is 0.8, and the probability that Witness 2 is correct is 0.7. Since they made opposite claims, we need to consider the case when Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is not. In other words, the probability that Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.24}
