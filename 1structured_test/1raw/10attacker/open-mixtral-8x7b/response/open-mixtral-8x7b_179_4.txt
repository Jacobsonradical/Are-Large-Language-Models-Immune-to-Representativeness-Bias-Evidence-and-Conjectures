Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker being in the taller group (15% of the population).
3. However, the first witness is only correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
4. So, even though the attacker is part of the taller group, we need to account for the possibility that the first witness could be incorrect.

Given these factors, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) = P(Witness claims correctly) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)
+ P(Witness claims incorrectly) * P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)
= (0.8)*(0.15) + (1-0.8)*(1-0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.24
= 0.36

Formatted answer: {probability: 0.36}
