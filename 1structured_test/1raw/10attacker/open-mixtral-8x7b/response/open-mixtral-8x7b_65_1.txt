Let's analyze the information given and reason through it to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in determining the correct height.
3. Witness 2 claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate in determining the correct height.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15

To calculate P(witness 1 is correct), we need to consider both witnesses' claims. If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, then witness 1 is correct with an 80% success rate. However, if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, then witness 1 is incorrect with a 20% error rate. We don't know yet whether the attacker is taller or shorter, so we'll have to account for both possibilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then,

P(witness 1 is correct) = P(witness 1 is correct | A) * P(A) + P(witness 1 is correct | B) * P(B)

We know the values for P(A) and P(B) (they add up to 1), and we know that P(witness 1 is correct | A) = 0.8 and P(witness 1 is correct | B) = 0.2.

To find P(witness 1 is correct), we can use the first witness's claim as evidence:

P(witness 1 is correct) = P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since witness 1's claim is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can simplify this expression:

P(witness 1 is correct) = 1 * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1's claim) = P(witness 1 is correct) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 * 0.15 = 0.0225

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.0225}
