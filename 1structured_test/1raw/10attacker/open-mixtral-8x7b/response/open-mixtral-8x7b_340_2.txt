Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This also means that they incorrectly identify a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 30% of the time.

Given these conditions, even though the victim couldn't see the attacker's height, we can still estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the testimony of the two witnesses.

The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Given their 80% accuracy rate, this gives us some confidence that the attacker might indeed be this tall. However, we also need to consider the testimony of the second witness who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, albeit with a lower accuracy rate of 70%.

To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, we would ideally want to apply Bayes' theorem. However, without specific numerical values for the joint probabilities, we can't calculate exact probabilities. 

But we can still make an educated estimate: since the first witness is usually correct (80% accuracy rate), and their statement is in line with the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, a reasonable estimate for the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller could be somewhere around 0.8 (or 80%). 

However, please note that this is an estimation and not a precise calculation. The actual probability could be different depending on the specific joint probabilities of the events.

Here's the answer strictly in the required format:
{probability: 0.8}
