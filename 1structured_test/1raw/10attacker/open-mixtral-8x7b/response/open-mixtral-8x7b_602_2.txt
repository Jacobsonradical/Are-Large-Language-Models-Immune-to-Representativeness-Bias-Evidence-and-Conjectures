Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller. We know this happens 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and 85% is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness claims 185 cm or taller) =
P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) +
P(first witness claims 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

= (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29 or 29%

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.29}.
