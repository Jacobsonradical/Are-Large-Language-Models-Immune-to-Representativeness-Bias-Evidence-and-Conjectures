Let's break down the information given:

1. Witness 1: 80% success rate in determining if a person is 185 cm or taller, 20% failure rate.
2. Witness 2: 70% success rate in determining if a person is 185 cm or taller, 30% failure rate.
3. City statistics: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so. To compute this, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let B be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.

First, we need to find P(B|A):
Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time.
P(B|A) = 0.8

Next, we need to find P(A):
The probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller is 15% according to city statistics.
P(A) = 0.15

Now, we need to find P(B):
We can use the law of total probability to find P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

First, let's find P(B|not A):
Given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., shorter than 185 cm), Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time.
P(B|not A) = 0.2

Now, we need to find P(not A):
The probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm is 85% according to city statistics.
P(not A) = 0.85

Now, we can find P(B):
P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.29)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim is approximately 0.345 (34.5%).
