To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height, and they have given conflicting statements.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1 is the event that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height.
W2 is the event that the second witness correctly identified the attacker's height.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identified the correct height about 80% of the time)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identified the correct height about 70% of the time)
P(W2|¬A) = 0.3 (the second witness erred in 30% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we calculate the probability of A given W1 and W2:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(¬A) = 1 - P(A)

Substituting the values:

P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
P(A|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.379310

Similarly, for the second witness:

P(A|W2) = P(W2|A) * P(A) / P(W2)
P(W2) = P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W2|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(W2) = (0.7)(0.15) + (0.3)(0.85) = 0.105 + 0.255 = 0.36
P(A|W2) = (0.7)(0.15) / 0.36 ≈ 0.291667

Since both witnesses have given conflicting statements, we should use the higher estimate, which is the probability based on the first witness's claim:

{probability: 0.379310}
