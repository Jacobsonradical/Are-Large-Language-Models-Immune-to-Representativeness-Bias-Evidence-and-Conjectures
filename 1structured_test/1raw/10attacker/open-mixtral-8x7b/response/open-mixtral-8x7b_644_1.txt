Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, let's consider the cases where this witness is correct and where this witness is not correct.

Case 1: The first witness is correct. The probability of this happening is 0.8 (80%).

Case 2: The first witness is not correct. This can happen in two ways:
  a) The first witness thinks the attacker is taller than 185 cm when the attacker is actually shorter. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (20%) * 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). So, the probability is 0.17 (17%).
  b) The first witness thinks the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is 0.2 (20%) * 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). So, the probability is 0.03 (3%).

Now, we add up the probabilities of these cases to get the total probability:

Probability = 0.8 (Case 1) + 0.17 (Case 2a) + 0.03 (Case 2b)
Probability = 0.8 + 0.17 + 0.03
Probability = 1

However, this result is not meaningful because it's greater than 1. This indicates that there is some error or contradiction in the given information. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a valid probability estimate based on the provided information.
