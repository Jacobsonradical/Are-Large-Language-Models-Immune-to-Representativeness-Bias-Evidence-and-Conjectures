Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. This is a problem of conditional probability, and we can use Bayes' theorem to solve it.
3. Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
4. In our case, event A is "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "one witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other said shorter than 185 cm"
5. We are asked to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B
6. To compute this, we need to find P(B|A), P(A), and P(B)
7. P(B|A) is the probability that both witnesses make contradictory statements, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is the first witness being correct (0.8) times the second witness making an error (0.3), which equals 0.8*0.3=0.24
8. P(A) is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which we are given as 0.15
9. To calculate P(B), we need to consider two possibilities: either the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or they are shorter. In the first case, both witnesses make contradictory statements with a probability of 0.24 (as calculated above). In the second case, where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witnesses making contradictory statements is the second witness being correct (0.7) times the first witness making an error (0.2), which equals 0.7*0.2=0.14
10. Since the attacker is more likely to be shorter than taller, P(B) is dominated by the second case. We can estimate P(B) as the probability of the second case, which is 0.14

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.24 * 0.15 / 0.14 â‰ˆ 0.27

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.27}
