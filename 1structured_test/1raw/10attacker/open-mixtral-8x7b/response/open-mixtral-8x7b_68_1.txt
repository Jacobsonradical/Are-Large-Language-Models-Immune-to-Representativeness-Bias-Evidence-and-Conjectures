Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which aligns with their correct identification in 80% of cases.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which also aligns with their correct identification in 70% of cases.

Given these discrepancies, we cannot definitively estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided. Ideally, we would need more information about how often both witnesses agree on a person's height and whether their combined assessments are more accurate than individual ones.

Therefore, I cannot provide an estimate that meets the strict format you requested. However, I would lean towards considering Witness 1's claim more likely due to their higher accuracy rate in identifying taller individuals.
