Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. There are two witnesses with different opinions about the attacker's height.
3. To estimate the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem, which requires us to find the prior probability, likelihood for each witness, and the total likelihood.
4. The prior probability is the probability that an attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% in the problem statement.
5. The likelihood for the first witness is 80% if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and 15% (100% - 85%) if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
6. The likelihood for the second witness is 30% if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and 70% if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
7. The total likelihood is the product of the two likelihoods, which is the probability that both witnesses agree on the attacker's height.
8. We can now calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the two witnesses' opinions.

The calculation for the posterior probability is as follows:

Posterior probability = (Prior probability * Likelihood for Witness 1 * Likelihood for Witness 2) / Total likelihood

The total likelihood is the sum of the products of the prior probability and the likelihood for each witness, given each height category:

Total likelihood = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3) + (0.85 * 0.15 * 0.7) + (0.15 * 0.2 * 0.7) + (0.85 * 0.8 * 0.3)

Total likelihood = 0.036 + 0.0189 + 0.021 + 0.196

Total likelihood = 0.2719

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

Posterior probability = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.3) / 0.2719

Posterior probability â‰ˆ 0.1069

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.1069}
