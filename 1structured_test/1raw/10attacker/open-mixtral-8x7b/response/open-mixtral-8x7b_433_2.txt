Let's reason through this:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating heights.
3. So, if we consider the witness's statement as evidence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller can be estimated as the likelihood that a randomly chosen person of that height would be identified as such by the witness.
4. Since half the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm and half is taller, the probability that a randomly chosen person who is 185 cm or taller would be identified as such by the first witness is 0.5 (the base rate) * 0.8 (the witness's accuracy), which equals 0.4.

However, we also need to consider the second witness's statement, who estimates shorter heights. 
5. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating heights.
6. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen person who is shorter than 185 cm would be identified as such by the second witness is 0.5 (the base rate) * 0.7 (the witness's accuracy), which equals 0.35.
7. Since these are the only two possibilities, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller by dividing the likelihood of the first scenario by the sum of the likelihoods of both scenarios.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4 / (0.4 + 0.35) = 0.53125}
