Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement.
2. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of the population in the city meets this criterion.
4. Therefore, we need to find the probability that the first witness would say "185 cm or taller" (with an 80% success rate) when the actual height is 185 cm or taller (15% of the population).
5. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
7. P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80%).
8. P(A) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
9. P(B) is the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" regardless of the attacker's actual height.
10. P(B) can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: P(B and A) and P(B and not A).
11. P(B and A) is the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" and the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (80% success rate * 15% of the population).
12. P(B and not A) is the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" when the attacker is not actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the probability that the first witness errs (20% chance) when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (85% of the population), which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
13. So, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345.
