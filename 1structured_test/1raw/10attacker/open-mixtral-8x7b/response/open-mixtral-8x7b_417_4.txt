Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller:

P(A185) = 0.8 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller)

Next, let's calculate the probability of the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm:

P(A<185) = 0.7 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm)

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, we can calculate the probability of the first witness's claim if the population height distribution is applied to the witnesses' observations:

P(O185) = P(A185) * 0.15 + P(A<185) * 0.85
       = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.7 * 0.85)
       = 0.34 + 0.595
       = 0.935

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.8 * 0.935, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
{probability: 0.748, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
