To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We are given the following probabilities:

P(E) = probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (80% accuracy)
P(~E) = probability that the first witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (20% inaccuracy)

P(A) = probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15
P(~A) = probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the city = 0.85

We want to find P(A|E), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E)

We have P(E|A) = 1 (first witness is correct when a tall person is actually tall), P(A) = 0.15, and P(E) = 0.8. Now we need to find P(E), which can be computed as:

P(E) = P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|~A) * P(~A)

P(E|~A) is the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This can be calculated as the false positive rate, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (30% inaccuracy).

Now we can find P(E):
P(E) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.255 = 0.405

Finally, we can find P(A|E):
P(A|E) = P(E|A) * P(A) / P(E) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.405 â‰ˆ 0.3698

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3698.
