Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with a probability of 0.15 (15%) and incorrect with a probability of 0.85 (85%).
3. When witness 1 is wrong, they think someone is 185 cm or taller when they are not. This means that, when witness 1 is wrong, they must be misclassifying someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm.
4. We also know that witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when they say someone is 185 cm or taller.

Given these pieces of information, we want to estimate the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed they were. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this probability as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness 1 claims so)

1. P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 1 (witness 1 is always correct when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
2. P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (15% of the population)
3. P(witness 1 claims so) = P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller)
   a. P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.2 (witness 1 errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)
   b. P(attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller) = 0.85 (85% of the population)
   c. P(witness 1 claims so) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.32

Now we can calculate the probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = (1 * 0.15) / 0.32 â‰ˆ 0.46875

{probability: 0.46875}
