Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies the correct height (either below or at least 185 cm) 80% of the time, and is wrong 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time, and is wrong 30% of the time.

b) 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we should consider two scenarios:
1) The first witness is correct, and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
2) The first witness is incorrect, and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of each scenario and then compare them.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to calculate P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is equal to the first witness's accuracy, which is 0.8 (80%).

P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population data.

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both scenarios (first witness correct and first witness incorrect):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is equal to the first witness's error rate, which is 0.2 (20%).
P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%) based on the population data.

So, P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) + (0.2)*(0.85) = 0.18 (18%)

Now we can compute P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)*(0.15) / (0.18) = 0.6667 â‰ƒ 0.67 (67%)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 67%.
