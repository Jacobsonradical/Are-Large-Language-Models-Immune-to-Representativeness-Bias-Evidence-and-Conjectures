Let's reason through this problem:

1. We want to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided.
2. Since the two witnesses have different levels of accuracy, we will calculate the probability using both their testimonies.
3. The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is correct with 80% probability.
4. The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct with 70% probability.
5. To calculate the probability that both witnesses are correct, we multiply their individual probabilities: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
6. However, we are interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
7. To find this, we need to consider the possibility that the first witness is correct (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and the second witness is incorrect (attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, but the second witness thinks they are shorter than 185 cm).
8. The probability that the second witness is incorrect when the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 20%.
9. Therefore, the probability that the first witness is correct AND the second witness is incorrect is 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16.
10. Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as the sum of the probability that both witnesses are correct and the probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect: 0.56 + 0.16 = 0.72.

{probability: 0.72}
