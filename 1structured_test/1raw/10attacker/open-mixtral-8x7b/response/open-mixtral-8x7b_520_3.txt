Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that the city's population has 85% of people shorter than 185 cm and 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is correct 80% of the time when the actual height is 185 cm or taller.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 70% of the time when the actual height is shorter than 185 cm.
4. Since we want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the two witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are interested in P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the two witnesses' testimonies.

We know P(B|A), which is the probability of the first witness being correct when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

We also know P(A), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).

To calculate P(B), we need to consider both cases for the attacker's height (shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller) and the accuracy of both witnesses in each case. However, this requires more information than what is provided in the question.

Without knowing P(B), we cannot calculate the exact probability P(A|B). But we can determine the upper bound for P(A|B) by assuming the minimum possible value for P(B), which is when both witnesses are most likely to be incorrect:

Minimum P(B) = P(B and not A) = P(first witness incorrect) * P(second witness incorrect) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 (when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the upper bound for P(A|B) using the minimum possible value for P(B):

P(A|B) ≤ P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.06 ≈ 1.67

Since P(A|B) must be between 0 and 1, the maximum value of P(A|B) under these conditions would be 1.

Therefore, our estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 1}
