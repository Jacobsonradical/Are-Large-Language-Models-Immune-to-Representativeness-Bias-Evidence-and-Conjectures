Let's break down the information given:

a) The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and errs 20% of the time. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, and errs 30% of the time.

b) In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed. Since both witnesses cannot be right at the same time, we should consider the reliability of their statements.

Let's use the law of total probability and calculate the probability based on both witnesses' statements:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1, W2) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 is correct) * P(W1 is correct) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 is incorrect) * P(W1 is incorrect)

We know that P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% from information b).

From information a), we know that P(W1 is correct) = 0.8 (when the person is 185 cm or taller) and P(W1 is incorrect) = 0.2 (when the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Similarly, we can calculate P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 is correct) = 1 and P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1 is incorrect) = 0.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | W1, W2) = (1 * 0.8) + (0 * 0.2) = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.8}.
