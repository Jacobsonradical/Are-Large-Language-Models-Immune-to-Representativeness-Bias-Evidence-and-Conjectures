To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information from the two witnesses and the population statistics.

Let's denote:

* A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W1 as the event that the first witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W2 as the event that the second witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* S as the event that the suspect is 185 cm or taller
* E as the event that the evidence is true (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)

We are interested in finding P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find that P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1), where:

* P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the first witness's accuracy, which is 80%.
* P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the population statistics: 15% (0.15).
* P(W1) is the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities: the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller AND the first witness is correct, and the probability that the attacker is NOT 185 cm or taller AND the first witness is incorrect.

Using the given probabilities, we can calculate P(W1) as follows:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + (1-0.2) \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.68
= 0.8

So now we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.15

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.15}
