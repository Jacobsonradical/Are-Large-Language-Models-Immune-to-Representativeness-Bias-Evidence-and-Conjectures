Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means that 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy for this claim is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy for this claim is 70%.

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(B) and P(C) be the probabilities corresponding to each witness's testimony.

P(B) = 0.8 (witness 1 correct)
P(C) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (witness 2 incorrect)

We want to find P(A|B ∧ C), the probability of A given both B and C. Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B ∧ C) = [P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(C|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(C|¬A) * P(¬A)]

We already know P(A) = 0.15 (15%) and P(¬A) = 0.85 (85%). We can also calculate:

P(B|A) = 1 (witness 1 always says true if the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(C|¬A) = 0.5 (witness 2 has a 50% chance of being correct if the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B ∧ C) = [(1 * 0.5 * 0.15) / ((1 * 0.5 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.5 * 0.85))]

Calculating this probability, we get:

{probability: 0.318, "This is a probability of approximately 31.8% that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed."}
