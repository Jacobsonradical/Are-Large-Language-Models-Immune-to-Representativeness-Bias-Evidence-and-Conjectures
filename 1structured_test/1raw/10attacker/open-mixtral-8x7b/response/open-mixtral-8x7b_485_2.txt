Let's break down the information given and reason through it:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% or 0.15 of the population is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (0.8) and errs in 20% of the cases (0.2).
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (0.7) and errs in 30% of the cases (0.3).

Now let's calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller according to the first witness's statement:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness's claim) = P(First Witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (from the information given)

To calculate P(First Witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller), we can use the first witness's accuracy:
P(First Witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (first witness's correct identification rate)

Now we can calculate the probability:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First Witness's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
