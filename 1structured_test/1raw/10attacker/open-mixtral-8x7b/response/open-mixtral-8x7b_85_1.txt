Let's first calculate the independent probabilities of the two witnesses being correct:

P(1st witness correct) = 80% = 0.8
P(2nd witness correct) = 70% = 0.7

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct, given that one said the attacker was taller or equal to 185 cm and the other said the attacker was shorter:

P(both correct) = P(1st correct) * P(2nd correct | 1st correct)

To calculate P(2nd correct | 1st correct), we need to consider that the second witness made an error. We know that the second witness will be incorrect 30% of the time, and since the first witness said the attacker was taller or equal to 1
