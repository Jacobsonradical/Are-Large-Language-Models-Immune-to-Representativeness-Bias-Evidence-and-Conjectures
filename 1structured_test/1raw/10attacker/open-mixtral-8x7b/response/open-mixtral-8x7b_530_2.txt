Let's break down the information given:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and their accuracy is 80%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and their accuracy is 70%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses.

We can calculate the probability of Witness 1 being correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
P(Tall | W1) = P(W1 is correct and attacker is tall)
= P(W1 is correct) * P(Attacker is tall)
= 0.8 * 0.15
= 0.12

Next, we need to calculate the probability of Witness 2 being incorrect when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
P(Short | W2 is incorrect) = 1 - P(Short | W2)
= 1 - (P(W2 is correct) * P(Attacker is short))
= 1 - (0.7 * 0.85)
= 1 - 0.595
= 0.405

Now, we need to calculate the probability that both conditions are met (Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 is incorrect):
P(Tall & W2 is incorrect) = P(Tall | W1) * P(W2 is incorrect)
= 0.12 * 0.405
= 0.0486

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.0486 or 4.86%.
