Let's analyze the information given:

a) We have two witnesses with different success rates in estimating a person's height. The first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and the second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time.

b) We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now, let's calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's statement:

1. If the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, there would be a 0.8 chance that the first witness would have identified the attacker correctly as being 185 cm or taller.
2. However, since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, this implies that the first witness must have incorrectly identified the attacker's height as being shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.2.
3. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness is correct in stating that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 + (1 - 0.85) * 0.2 = 0.12 + 0.15 = 0.27 or 27%.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.27}.
