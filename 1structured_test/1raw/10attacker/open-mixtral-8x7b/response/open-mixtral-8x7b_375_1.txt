To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use the information about the first witness's ability to judge a person's height and the base rate of people's heights in the city. We will use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of two events.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We are given:

- P(B|A): The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (80%).
- P(A): The base rate of attackers with a height of 185 cm or taller in the city. This is 0.15 (15%).
- P(B): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of two probabilities:
  (1) The probability of the witness correctly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller multiplied by the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller (0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12)
  (2) The probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller multiplied by the probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm (0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17)

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.345}
