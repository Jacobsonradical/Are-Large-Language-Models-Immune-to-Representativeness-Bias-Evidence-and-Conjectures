Let's break down the information given:

a. The first witness is correct 80% of the time when estimating a person's height as 185 cm or taller.
b. The second witness is correct 70% of the time when estimating a person's height as shorter than 185 cm.
c. In the city's population, 15% of people are 185 cm or taller, and 85% are shorter.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's denote:
- A as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B as the event that the first witness's claim is correct.

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know:
P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the true height is 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (population proportion with height 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider two possibilities:
1. The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (A is true), and the first witness is correct (B is true).
2. The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (A is false), and the first witness mistakenly claims the height is 185 cm or taller (B is true).

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.345

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.345 (or 34.5%).
