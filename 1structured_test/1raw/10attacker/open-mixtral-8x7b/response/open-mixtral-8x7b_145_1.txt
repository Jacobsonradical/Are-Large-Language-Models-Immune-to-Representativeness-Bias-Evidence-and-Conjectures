Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the city's population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

Where A is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B is the event that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want P(A|B), and we have P(B|A) = 0.8 (witness 1's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (population percentage of people 185 cm or taller), and P(B) is the total probability of witness 1 making the claim, which can be calculated as:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)
= P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
= (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
= (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
