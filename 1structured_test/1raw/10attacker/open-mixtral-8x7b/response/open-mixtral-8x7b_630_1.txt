Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the attacker's actual height in 15% of the population. However, this witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's testimony is 15% * 80% = 0.12 or 12%.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts Witness 1. Since Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, this doesn't affect our estimation based on Witness 1's testimony.

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 or 12%.
