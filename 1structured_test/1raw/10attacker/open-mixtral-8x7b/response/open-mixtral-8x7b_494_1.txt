Let's reason through this:

1. We know that Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller 80% of the time, and incorrectly identifies them as such 20% of the time.
2. The total population is split 85/15 between under/at or above 185cm.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given Witness 1's statement, we need to calculate the false positive rate (when the attacker is not 185cm or taller but is identified as such) and the true positive rate (when the attacker is 185cm or taller and is identified as such).
4. False positive rate = 20% * 85% = 17%
5. True positive rate = 80% * 15% = 12%
6. Since we don't have any other information, we assume that these errors are equally likely, making the estimate of the attacker being 185cm or taller equal to the true positive rate divided by the sum of the true positive rate and the false discovery rate (1 - (1-false positive rate) * (1-true positive rate)).
7. So, the probability is 12% / (12% + (1 - (1 - 0.17)) * (1 - 0.12)) = 0.30 or 30%.

{probability: 0.30}
