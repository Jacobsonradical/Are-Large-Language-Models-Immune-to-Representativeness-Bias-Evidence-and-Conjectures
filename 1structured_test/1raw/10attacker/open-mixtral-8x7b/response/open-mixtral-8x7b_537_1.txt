Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses who have a certain accuracy in estimating a person's height. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. The second witness is correct 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

b. We also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Our goal is to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's statement. To make an accurate estimate, we'll need to consider both witnesses' statements and the population statistics.

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Using the first witness's statement, we can calculate the probability that both witnesses would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height).

P(W1_tall & W2_tall) = P(W1_tall) * P(W2_tall | W1_tall)

Here, P(W1_tall) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 1 (since the first witness made this claim), and P(W2_tall | W1_tall) is the probability that the second witness also claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness has made this claim.

Using our knowledge of the witnesses' accuracy, we can estimate P(W2_tall | W1_tall) as follows:

P(W2_tall | W1_tall) = P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall) / P(W1_tall)

We know that P(W1_tall) is 1, so we need to find P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall). To do this, let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall) = P(W2_tall | A) * P(A) + P(W2_tall | A') * P(A')

Since the second witness is correct 70% of the time, P(W2_tall | A) = 1 (the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker actually is 185 cm or taller) and P(W2_tall | A') = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is not).

We also know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15 and P(A') = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we can calculate P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall):

P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall) = (1 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.15 + 0.255 = 0.405

Now, we can calculate P(W2_tall | W1_tall):

P(W2_tall | W1_tall) = P(W2_tall ∩ W1_tall) / P(W1_tall) = 0.405 / 1 = 0.405

Finally, we can calculate P(A | W1_tall & W2_tall):

P(A | W1_tall & W2_tall) = P(W1_tall & W2_tall) / P(W1_tall) = P(W1_tall) * P(W2_tall | W1_tall) * P(A) / P(W1_tall)

We know that P(W1_tall) = 1 and P(A) = 0.15, so:

P(A | W1_tall & W2_tall) = (1 * 0.405 * 0.15) / 1 = 0.06075

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.06075 or 6.075%.
