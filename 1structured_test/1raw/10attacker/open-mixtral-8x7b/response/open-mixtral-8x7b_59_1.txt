Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which aligns with the true height 15% of the time. However, due to their error rate, they might also claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter, which happens 20% of the time.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which aligns with the true height 85% of the time. However, they might also claim the attacker is shorter when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which happens 30% of the time.

Given that both witnesses' claims cannot both be correct, we need to consider the more likely scenario. Since Witness 2 has a higher correct identification rate (70% vs 80% for Witness 1), it's more likely that the attacker was indeed shorter than 185 cm if we consider their testimonies individually.

However, since the question asks for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on Witness 1's claim alone, we cannot factor in Witness 2's testimony. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 15% (the base rate from the city's population data).

Answer: {probability: 0.15}
