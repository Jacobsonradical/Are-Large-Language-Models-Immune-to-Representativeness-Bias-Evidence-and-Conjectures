Let's break down the information given and reason through it:

1. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time.
2. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time.
3. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Now let's calculate the probability that both witnesses would be correct if the attacker's height were 185 cm or taller:
- The probability that Witness 1 is correct is 0.8 (80%).
- The probability that Witness 2 is incorrect is 0.15 (15%), since they claim the attacker is taller than 185 cm when they should claim the attacker is shorter.

We want to find the probability of both events happening, so we multiply the probabilities: 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12 (or 12%).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.12}
