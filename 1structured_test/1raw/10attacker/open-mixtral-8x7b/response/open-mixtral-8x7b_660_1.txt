Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know happens only 15% of the time naturally.
3. However, the first witness is correct 80% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 20% of the time.
4. The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is correct 85% of the time naturally.
5. But the second witness is only correct 70% of the time when making this claim, and incorrect 30% of the time.

Given these percentages, it seems more likely that the first witness is incorrect, since the attacker being 185 cm or taller is a rarer occurrence and the second witness has a higher error rate when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now let's calculate:

Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
We want to find P(A | W1, W2), the probability of A given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:
P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) / P(W1, W2)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(W1, W2 | A), we need to consider the case where A and both witness testimonies are true, and the case where A and only the first witness' testimony is true.

P(W1, W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A) = (0.8) * (0.3) = 0.24

However, there is also a possibility that the second witness is correct and the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, in which case both witnesses' testimonies would be incorrect. We need to account for this possibility in our calculation.

Let's denote P(A') as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
We want to find P(A' | W1', W2'), the probability of A' given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we can write:
P(A' | W1', W2') = P(W1', W2' | A') * P(A') / P(W1', W2')

We are given:
P(A') = 0.85
P(W1'|A') = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2'|A') = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Calculating P(W1', W2' | A'):
P(W1', W2' | A') = P(W1' | A') * P(W2' | A') = (0.2) * (0.7) = 0.14

Now we can find P(W1, W2) using the law of total probability:
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2 | A') * P(A')

Plugging in our values:
P(W1, W2) = (0.24) * (0.15) + (0.14) * (0.85) ≈ 0.102 + 0.119 ≈ 0.221

Now we can calculate P(A | W1, W2):
P(A | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | A) * P(A) / P(W1, W2) ≈ (0.24) * (0.15) / (0.221) ≈ 0.0675 / 0.221 ≈ 0.305

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.305.
