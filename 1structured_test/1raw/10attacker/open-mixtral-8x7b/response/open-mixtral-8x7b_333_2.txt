Let's first calculate the likelihood of the first witness being correct when they claim a person is 185 cm or taller, which we'll denote as P(T|W1). We know that they are correct 80% of the time, so:

P(T|W1) = 0.8

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the first witness claiming a person is 185 cm or taller when they are actually that tall, which we'll denote as P(W1|T). According to the information provided, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so:

P(W1|T) = 0.15

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) / P(W1)

We don't know the prior probability P(T), so we'll have to make an assumption about it. Given that the two pieces of information we have seem to be independent, a reasonable assumption might be that the proportion of attackers who are 185 cm or taller is the same as the proportion in the general population, i.e., P(T) = 0.15.

We also need to calculate P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming a person is 185 cm or taller. This is equal to the probability of the witness being correct when they make this claim, which we've already calculated as P(T|W1) = 0.8.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) / P(W1)
= 0.15 * 0.15 / 0.8
= 0.028125

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.028125}
