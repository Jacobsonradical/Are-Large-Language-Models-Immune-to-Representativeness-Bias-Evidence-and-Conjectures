Let's reason through this problem:

We know that there are two witnesses with different claims about the attacker's height. To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use the law of total probability. This means we will calculate the probability for each witness's claim and then combine them using their respective weights (their ability to correctly estimate a person's height).

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time. So, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) = 0.8

Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time. So, P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2) = 0.7

Now, let's consider the population distribution: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness 1) = 0.5 (since there is a 50% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and a 50% chance they are not)
P(Witness 2) = 0.5

Now, we apply the law of total probability:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1) * P(Witness 1) + P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2) * P(Witness 2)
= 0.8 * 0.5 + 0.15 * 0.5
= 0.4 + 0.075
= 0.475

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.475}
