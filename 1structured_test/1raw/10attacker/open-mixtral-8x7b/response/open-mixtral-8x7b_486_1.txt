Let's analyze the information given and calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% success rate in determining the correct height. This means that when the true height is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance they will be correct.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% success rate in determining the correct height. This means that when the true height is 185 cm or taller, there's a 30% chance they will incorrectly think the person is shorter than 185 cm (due to their 70% success rate when the true height is shorter than 185 cm).
4. Since both witnesses' claims can't be true at the same time, we need to find the probability that Witness 1 is correct when the true height is 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 is incorrect when the true height is 185 cm or taller.
5. Using the success rates of both witnesses, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = P(Witness 1 correct) * P(Witness 2 incorrect)

P(Witness 1 correct) = 0.8 (80% success rate)
P(Witness 2 incorrect) = 0.3 (30% failure rate)

P(Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.24}
