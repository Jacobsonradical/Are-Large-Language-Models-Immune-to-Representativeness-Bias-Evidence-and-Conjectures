Let's reason through this:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter.
3. The second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. This also means they incorrectly identify someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.

Given that one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the other claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we need to calculate the probability that both witnesses would make this mistake if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm.

The probability that the first witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 20%, and the probability that the second witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 30%. Since these are independent events, we can multiply these probabilities together to get the overall probability of both mistakes happening:

0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06 or 6%

This means there's a 6% chance that both witnesses would mistakenly identify a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

1 - 0.06 = 0.94 or 94%

{probability: 0.94}
