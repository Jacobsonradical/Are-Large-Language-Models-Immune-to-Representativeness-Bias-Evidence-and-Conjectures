Let's reason through this:

We know that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can set up a probability tree. The probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of them mistakenly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not is 0.2 (20%).

So, the total probability is 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.14 = 0.26, or 26%.

Answer: {probability: 0.26}
