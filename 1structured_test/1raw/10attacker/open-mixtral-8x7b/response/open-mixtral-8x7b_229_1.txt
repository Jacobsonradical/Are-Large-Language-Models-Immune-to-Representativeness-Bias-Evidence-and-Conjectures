Let's first calculate the probability of the first witness being correct when they claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, and the second witness being correct when they claim the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

P(1st correct) = 0.80
P(2nd correct) = 0.70

Since we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm, the probability of a randomly chosen person being 185cm or taller is 15%. However, since the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller, we should only consider people in this height range.

Given that the first witness has identified someone as 185cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185cm or taller is:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claim) = P(1st correct) * P(attacker is 185cm or taller) / P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller)

We need to calculate P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller):

P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller) = P(1st correct) * P(attacker is 185cm or taller) + P(1st incorrect) * P(attacker is shorter)

Now, the probability that the attacker is in the shorter group is:

P(attacker is shorter) = 1 - P(attacker is 185cm or taller) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

And the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185cm or taller is:

P(1st incorrect) = 1 - P(1st correct) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20

We can now calculate P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller):

P(witness identifies attacker as 185cm or taller) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185cm or taller | 1st witness claim) = 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.345 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 1.19

Since this probability is greater than 1, it suggests that the information given is insufficient or inconsistent. It is not possible to have a probability greater than 1, and this highlights an inconsistency in the provided data.
