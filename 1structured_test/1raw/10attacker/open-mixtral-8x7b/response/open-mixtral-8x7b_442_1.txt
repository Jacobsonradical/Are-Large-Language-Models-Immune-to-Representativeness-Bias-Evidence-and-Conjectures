Let's first calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This happens when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and the first witness correctly identifies this. This probability is therefore 0.15 (the proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller) times 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy), which is 0.12.

Next, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct when she claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This happens when the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm, and the first witness correctly identifies this. This probability is therefore 0.85 (the proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm) times 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when identifying people shorter than 185 cm), which is 0.68.

However, this second probability is not relevant to our question, as the first witness did not claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we only need to consider the first probability, which is 0.12.

So, {probability: 0.12}
