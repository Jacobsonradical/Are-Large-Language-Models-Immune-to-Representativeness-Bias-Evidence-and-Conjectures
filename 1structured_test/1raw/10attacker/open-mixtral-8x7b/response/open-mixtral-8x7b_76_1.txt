Let's break down the information given:

a. We have two witnesses with different abilities to judge a person's height. Witness 1 correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time and is incorrect 20% of the time. Witness 2 correctly identifies the correct height 70% of the time and is incorrect 30% of the time.

b. In the city's population, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Given that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's accuracy.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = P(Witness 1 is correct) * P(Population is 185 cm or taller)

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1's claim) = 0.8 * 0.15 â‰ˆ 0.12

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.

{probability: 0.12}
