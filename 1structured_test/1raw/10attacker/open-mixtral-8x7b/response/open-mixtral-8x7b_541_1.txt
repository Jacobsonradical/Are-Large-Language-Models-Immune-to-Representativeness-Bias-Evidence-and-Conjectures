Let's break down the problem and calculate the probabilities:

1. The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens with 15% probability according to statement "a".
2. However, the first witness makes mistakes. When the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the first witness correctly identifies this as true 80% of the time (statement "b"). So, there's an 80% chance that the witness is correct when they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. When the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, the first witness incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (statement "b"). Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 0.2 * 0.85 = 17% chance that the witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. We can now calculate the overall probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the witness's claim, by combining the two probabilities from steps 2 and 3: 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 â‰ˆ 0.255 or 25.5%.

{probability: 0.255}
