To solve this problem, we can use conditional probability and the law of total probability. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of the two witnesses. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B be the first witness saying A is true, and C be the second witness saying A is false.

From the problem, we know P(A) = 0.15, P(B|A) = 0.8, P(B|A') = 0.2 (where A' is the complementary event of A), P(C|A) = 0.3, and P(C|A') = 0.7.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B. Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), and we need to find P(B). We can find P(B) by using the law of total probability, P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and A'), which is P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'). So, P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.20 + 0.17 = 0.37.

Now, we can find P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8)(0.15) / (0.37) = 0.12 or 12%.
