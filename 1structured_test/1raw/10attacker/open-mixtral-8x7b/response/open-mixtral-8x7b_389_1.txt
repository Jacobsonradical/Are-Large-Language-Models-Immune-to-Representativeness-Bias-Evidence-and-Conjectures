Let's reason through this problem:

1. We know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, which means 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they have an 80% accuracy rate.
3. Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they have a 70% accuracy rate.

We want to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by Witness 1. To do this, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses being correct and multiply these probabilities together.

Probability of Witness 1 being correct = 0.15 (attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) * 0.8 (witness accuracy) = 0.12

Probability of Witness 2 being correct = 0.85 (attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) * 0.7 (witness accuracy) = 0.595

Now, we multiply these probabilities together:

Probability of both witnesses being correct = 0.12 * 0.595 â‰ˆ 0.0714

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by Witness 1, is approximately 0.0714 or 7.14%.

{probability: 0.0714}
