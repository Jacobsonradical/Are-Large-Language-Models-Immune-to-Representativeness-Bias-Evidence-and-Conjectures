{probability: 0.48, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed that tall, is 0.8 (80% accurate). The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not that tall, is 0.2 (20% error rate). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.48.}
