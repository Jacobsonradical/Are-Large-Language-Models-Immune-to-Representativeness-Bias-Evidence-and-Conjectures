{probability: 0.62,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.

2. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and makes an error 20% of the time.

3. Given that the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the probability that the witness was correct, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. This is called the positive predictive value (PPV).

4. The formula for PPV is: PPV = (true positive rate) / [(true positive rate) + (false positive rate)]

5. In this case, the true positive rate is 80% (probability of the witness correctly identifying a person who is 185 cm or taller), and the false positive rate is 20% (probability of the witness incorrectly claiming a person is 185 cm or taller when they are not).

6. Plugging in the numbers, we get: PPV = 0.8 / (0.8 + 0.2*0.85) = 0.62

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.62.
