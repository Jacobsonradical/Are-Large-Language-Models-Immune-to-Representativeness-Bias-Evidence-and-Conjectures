{probability: 0.57,

Explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the base rate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Considering the first witness's accuracy, they correctly identify the correct height 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness is correct is 0.8.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = [P(witness claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness claims so)

P(witness claims so) = P(witness claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness claims so | attacker is shorter) * P(attacker is shorter)

Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller, P(witness claims so | attacker is shorter) is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.57 }
