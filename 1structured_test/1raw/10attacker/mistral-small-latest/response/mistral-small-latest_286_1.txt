{probability: 0.61, This is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time and the attacker has a 15% chance of being 185 cm or taller according to the city's population distribution, the estimated probability is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.61.}
