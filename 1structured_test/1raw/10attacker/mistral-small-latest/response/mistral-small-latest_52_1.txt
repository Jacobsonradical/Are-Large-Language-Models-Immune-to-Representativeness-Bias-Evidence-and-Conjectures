{probability: 0.61, This estimate was calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%), and the first witness's accuracy in identifying correct height is 0.8 (80%), the posterior probability is calculated as 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.61 or 61%.}
