{probability: 0.52, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from b). The likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given they were 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.52.}
