{probability: 0.72, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness in identifying heights (80%) and the distribution of heights in the city (15% of people are 185 cm or taller). So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.72 or 72%.}
