{probability: 0.56, explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given by information a). The probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given by information b). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56.}
