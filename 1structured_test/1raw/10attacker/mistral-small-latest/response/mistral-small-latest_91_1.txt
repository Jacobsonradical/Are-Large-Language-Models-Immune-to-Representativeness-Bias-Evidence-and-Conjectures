{probability: 0.54, This estimate is based on the reliability of the first witness and the distribution of heights in the city. The witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together yields an estimate of 0.29, or approximately 54% when rounded to one decimal place.}
