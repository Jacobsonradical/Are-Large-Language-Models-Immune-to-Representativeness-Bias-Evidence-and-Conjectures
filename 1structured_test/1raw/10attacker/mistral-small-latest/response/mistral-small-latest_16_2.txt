{probability: 0.38,

Explanation:

Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
3. To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities. Let's assume the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The first witness would incorrectly claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2 (20% error rate). So, P(B|not A) = 0.2. Now, we can use the law of total probability to find P(B):
   P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.205

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.205 â‰ˆ 0.38

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.38.}
