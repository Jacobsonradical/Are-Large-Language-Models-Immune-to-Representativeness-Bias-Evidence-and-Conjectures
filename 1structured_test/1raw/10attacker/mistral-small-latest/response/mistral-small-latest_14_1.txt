{probability: 0.65, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time, and the probability of a randomly selected person being 185 cm or taller is 15%, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness claimed the attacker was taller, so we should consider the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is taller. Using Bayes' theorem, this is calculated as (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = approximately 0.65.}
