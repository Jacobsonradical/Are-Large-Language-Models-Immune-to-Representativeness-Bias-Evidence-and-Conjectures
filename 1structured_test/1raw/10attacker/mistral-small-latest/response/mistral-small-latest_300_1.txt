{probability: 0.62, explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability (P(A)) that the attacker is taller than 185 cm is 0.15. The first witness's probability of being correct given that the attacker is taller than 185 cm (P(W1|A)) is 0.8, and the probability of being incorrect (P(~W1|A)) is 0.2. So, the posterior probability (P(A|W1)) is (P(W1|A)*P(A)) / (P(W1|A)*P(A) + P(~W1|A)*P(~A)) = (0.8*0.15) / ((0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)) = 0.62.}
