{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (given by b). The likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given by a). The likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (also given by a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.54.}
