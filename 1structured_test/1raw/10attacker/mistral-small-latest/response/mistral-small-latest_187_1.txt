{probability: 0.603, based on the provided information and assuming the witnesses are independent and unbiased}

Here's the reasoning:
1. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, according to the population statistics.
2. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker's height.
3. Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies this is 0.80.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, is calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness claims so) = [P(First witness claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(First witness claims so)
5. P(First witness claims so) can be calculated as follows: P(First witness claims so) = [P(First witness claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(First witness claims so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]
6. P(First witness claims so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is the probability that the first witness makes an error, which is 0.20.
7. P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.
8. Plugging in the values, we get P(First witness claims so) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
9. Finally, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness claims so) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.603

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.603.
