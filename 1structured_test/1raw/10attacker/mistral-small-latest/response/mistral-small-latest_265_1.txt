{probability: 0.66, Your estimate is 0.66. This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of 15% for people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, and the first witness's accuracy of 80%, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed so, is approximately 0.66.}
