{probability: 0.67, which is estimated by calculating the product of the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm (0.15) and the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that he is taller than 185 cm (0.8), resulting in 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Then, we divide this value by the sum of the probabilities that the first witness is correct for both possibilities of the attacker's height (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.18), resulting in 0.12 / 0.18 â‰ˆ 0.67.}
