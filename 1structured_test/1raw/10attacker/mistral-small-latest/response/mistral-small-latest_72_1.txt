Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. We are given that the first witness is correct in identifying the height 80% of the time. However, we need to consider the overall distribution of heights in the population (given in "a").

Let's assume that the attacker's height is a random variable from the population. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given in "a").

If the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies this is 0.8 (given in "b"). Therefore, the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed this tall, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, the witness could also claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller even if the attacker is not (a false positive). The probability of this happening is 0.2 (the witness's error rate) times the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85. So, 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Therefore, the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probabilities of this happening when the attacker is actually this tall (0.12) and when the attacker is not (0.17), which is 0.29.

However, we are asked for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed this. This is a reversal of the probabilities and can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed this, is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.56 (rounded to two decimal places).}
