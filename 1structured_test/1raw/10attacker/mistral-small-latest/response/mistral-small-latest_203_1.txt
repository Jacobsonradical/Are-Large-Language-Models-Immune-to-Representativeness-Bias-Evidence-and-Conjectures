{probability: 0.56, given the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the witness's accuracy in identifying such a height is 0.8, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the witness's error in identifying shorter individuals as taller, which is 0.2. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, this error contributes an additional 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 to the estimated probability. So, the total estimated probability is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.56}
