Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's denote:

- E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(E): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information "a".
- P(W1|E): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.80 according to the witness's ability.
- P(W1|¬E): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate of the first witness when the attacker is shorter, which is 0.20.

Bayes' theorem states that P(E|W1) = P(W1|E) * P(E) / P(W1). We can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability: P(W1) = P(W1|E) * P(E) + P(W1|¬E) * P(¬E), where P(¬E) = 1 - P(E) = 0.85.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(E|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) ≈ 0.4286

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.43.

Final answer: {probability: 0.43}
