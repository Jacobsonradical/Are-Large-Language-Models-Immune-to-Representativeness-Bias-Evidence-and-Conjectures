{probability: 0.57, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller. Given that the witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker was indeed shorter than 185 cm according to the witness is 0.85*0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 1 - 0.17 = 0.57}
