The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given the initial probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city (0.15) and the witness's accuracy (0.8), we can calculate the posterior probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

P(B|A) = the witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(A) = the initial probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15

To find P(B), we need to consider both the witness's accuracy and the initial probabilities. So, P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.24

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.24 â‰ˆ 0.5

So, {probability: 0.5} is the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.
