{probability: 0.53, The estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of 15% for the attacker being 185 cm or taller, the likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height is 0.8, and the likelihood of the first witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller), the posterior probability is approximately 0.53.}
