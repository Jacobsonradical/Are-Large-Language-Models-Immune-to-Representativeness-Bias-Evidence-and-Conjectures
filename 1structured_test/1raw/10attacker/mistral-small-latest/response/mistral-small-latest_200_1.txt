Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows:

1. The base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.
2. The first witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time and makes errors 20% of the time.
3. If the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness would correctly identify the height is 0.8.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identified the height is the product of the base rate and the witness's accuracy: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: {probability: 0.12}
