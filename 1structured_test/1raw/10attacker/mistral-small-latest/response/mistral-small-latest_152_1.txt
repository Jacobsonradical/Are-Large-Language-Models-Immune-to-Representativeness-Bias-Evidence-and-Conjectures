{probability: 0.67}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume the attacker's height is a random variable following the population distribution in the city. Then, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (given information "a").

2. Now, we consider the witness's report. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with a probability of 80% when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (true positive rate). The witness also incorrectly claims a shorter person is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 20% (false positive rate).

3. Let's denote P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(F) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We know P(T) = 0.15 and P(F) = 0.85.

4. The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the true positive probability and the false positive probability, weighted by the probabilities of the attacker's height: P(claiming T) = P(T) * true positive rate + P(F) * false positive rate.

5. Plugging in the values, we get P(claiming T) = 0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.67.

6. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.67.
