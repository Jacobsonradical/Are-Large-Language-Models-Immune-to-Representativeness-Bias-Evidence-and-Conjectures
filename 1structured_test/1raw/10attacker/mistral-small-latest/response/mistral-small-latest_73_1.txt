{probability: 0.59, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony, given that the attacker is shorter, is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.59.}
