{probability: 0.58, based on the information provided, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.58 or 58%.}

Here's the reasoning behind this:

1. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the general population is 15%.
2. The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying the correct height.
3. Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies this is 0.8.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identifies this is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%.
5. However, the first witness could also have identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker was actually shorter. The probability that the first witness makes an error when the attacker is shorter is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter) * 0.2 (since the witness has a 20% error rate) = 0.17 or 17%.
6. Therefore, the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct and making an error, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 or 29%.
7. However, we need to adjust this for the fact that only one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, while the other witness claimed the opposite. Since the witnesses are equally reliable, we can assume that each witness's claim is independent of the other. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.71 * 0.3) = approximately 0.58 or 58%.
