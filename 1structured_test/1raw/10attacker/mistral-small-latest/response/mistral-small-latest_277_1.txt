{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: Given the information about the witnesses' accuracy, we can calculate the probability that they are correct given that they claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

For the first witness, the probability of being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 80% (since they have an 80% accuracy rate for this height group). This translates to a probability of 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the base rate of the population, which is that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

So, the final probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = [P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 1 says so)

P(Witness 1 says so) = P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26 + 0.17 = 0.43

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.43 â‰ˆ 0.64 or 64%
