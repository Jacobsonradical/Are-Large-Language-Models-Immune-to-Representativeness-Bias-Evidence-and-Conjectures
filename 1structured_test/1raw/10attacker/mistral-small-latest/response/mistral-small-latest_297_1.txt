  "probability": 0.48,
  "explanation": "This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

  Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

  We know from the problem that P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

  To find P(W1), we need to consider two scenarios: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (A), and the attacker is shorter (not A).

  P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)

  We know P(A) = 0.15, and P(not A) = 0.85 (since the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, as given in the problem).

  P(W1|not A) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter, which is the opposite of the witness's accuracy rate in this case. So, P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness makes an error 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter).

  Substituting these values, we get P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

  Finally, P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.48."
