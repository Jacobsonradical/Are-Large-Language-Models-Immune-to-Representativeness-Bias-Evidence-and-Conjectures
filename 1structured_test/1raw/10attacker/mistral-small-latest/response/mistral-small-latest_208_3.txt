{probability: 0.588, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter is 0.85. The first witness has an 80% chance of being correct when the person is actually taller, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is taller is 0.8. The probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is shorter is 0.2 (since the witness has a 20% chance of error in this case). Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get a posterior probability of 0.588 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.}
