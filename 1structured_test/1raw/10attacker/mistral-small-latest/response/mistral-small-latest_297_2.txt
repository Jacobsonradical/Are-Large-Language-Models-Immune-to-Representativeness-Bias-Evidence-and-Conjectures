{probability: 0.63, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of the population (85% shorter than 185 cm), the reliability of the first witness (80% accuracy), and the conflicting testimony of the second witness (30% error rate when claiming the person is shorter than 185 cm), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.63.}
