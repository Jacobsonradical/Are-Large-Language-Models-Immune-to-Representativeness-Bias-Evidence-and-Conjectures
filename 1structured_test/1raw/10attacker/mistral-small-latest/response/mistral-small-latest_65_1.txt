{probability: 0.62,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. This is the prior probability.
2. The first witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases under similar conditions. So, the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
3. The probability that the witness is incorrect given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so: P(A|W) = P(W|A) * P(A) / P(W).
5. P(W), the probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: P(W) = P(W|A) * P(A) + P(W|~A) * P(~A), where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
6. P(W|~A), the probability that the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter, is 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness).
7. Substituting the given probabilities into the equation, we get P(A|W) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) ≈ 0.62.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.62.}
