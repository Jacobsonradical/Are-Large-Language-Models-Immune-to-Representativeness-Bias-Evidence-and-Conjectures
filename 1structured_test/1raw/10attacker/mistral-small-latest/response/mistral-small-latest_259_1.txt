{probability: 0.62, The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy in judging height, identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and considering the witness's accuracy, the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.62 (calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)).}
