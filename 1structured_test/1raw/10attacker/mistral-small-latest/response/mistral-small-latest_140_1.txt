{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume there are 100 people in the sample (this is just for easier calculation and doesn't affect the final probability).
2. According to the population distribution provided, 85 of them are shorter than 185 cm, and 15 are 185 cm or taller.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of cases, so they will identify the correct height for 12 out of the 15 taller people (0.8 * 15 = 12).
4. They will also incorrectly identify 3 of the shorter people as taller (20% of 15, the number of people they should have identified as shorter).
5. So, the first witness claims that 15 people (12 + 3) are 185 cm or taller.
6. Given that 15 people actually are 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 12/15 = 0.64 or 64%.
