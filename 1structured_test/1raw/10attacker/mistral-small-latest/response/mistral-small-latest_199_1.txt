{probability: 0.52, explanation: Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses correctly identified the height. We want to find P(A|B1), the probability of A given B1. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / P(B1). We are given that P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller), and P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). We need to find P(B1), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct given the attacker is tall (P(B1|A)*P(A)) and the attacker is short (P(B1|not A)*P(not A)). We are given P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm) and P(not A) = 0.85. Calculating P(B1) gives approximately 0.237. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.52.}
