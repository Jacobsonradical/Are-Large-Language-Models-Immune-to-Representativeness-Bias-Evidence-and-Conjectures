{probability: 0.49, Given the information provided, the first witness is correct in 80% of cases when the person is 185 cm or taller. However, considering that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to factor in this population distribution. So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness is correct is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness is incorrect, but the second witness is correct, is 0.15 * 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.021. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.49 or 49%.}
