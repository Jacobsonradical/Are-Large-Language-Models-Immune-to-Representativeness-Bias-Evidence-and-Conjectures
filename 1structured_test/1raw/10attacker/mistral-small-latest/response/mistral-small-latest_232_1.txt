{probability: 0.67, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of 15% for people 185 cm or taller in the city (b), the first witness's accuracy of 80% when the person is 185 cm or taller, and the witness's overall accuracy of 85% (the average of their accuracy for both tall and short people), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim is approximately 0.67.}
