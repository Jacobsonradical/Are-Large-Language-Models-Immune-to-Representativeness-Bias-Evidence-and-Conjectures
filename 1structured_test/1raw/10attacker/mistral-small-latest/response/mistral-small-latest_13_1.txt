{probability: 0.56, Given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from b). The likelihood of the first witness's observation given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.56.}
