{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying heights, correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(taller|witness) = [P(witness|taller)*P(taller)] / P(witness). Here, P(witness|taller) is the witness's accuracy rate of 0.8, P(taller) is the base probability of 0.15, and P(witness) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct for both tall and short individuals. This can be calculated as 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.25. Therefore, P(taller|witness) = (0.8*0.15) / 0.25 â‰ˆ 0.62.}
