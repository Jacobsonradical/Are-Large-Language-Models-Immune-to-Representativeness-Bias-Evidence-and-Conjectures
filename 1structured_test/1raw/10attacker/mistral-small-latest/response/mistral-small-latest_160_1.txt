{probability: 0.571, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%). The likelihood of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (20%). The posterior probability, which is the probability that we're interested in, is calculated as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.571.}
