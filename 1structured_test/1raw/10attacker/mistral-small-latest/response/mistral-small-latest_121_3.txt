{probability: 0.56, based on the given information and assuming the witnesses are independent, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem and the accuracy rates of the witnesses. The calculation is (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.56}
