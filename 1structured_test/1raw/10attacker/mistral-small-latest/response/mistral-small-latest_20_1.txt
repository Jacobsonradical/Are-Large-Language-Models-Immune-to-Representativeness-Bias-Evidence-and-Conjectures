{probability: 0.54, calculation: Given the information about the city's population distribution, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can update our probability using Bayes' theorem. The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is (0.15*0.8)/((0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2)) = 0.54.}
