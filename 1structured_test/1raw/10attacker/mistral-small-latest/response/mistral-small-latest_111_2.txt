{probability: 0.52, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the prevalence of people 185 cm or taller in the population. Given that the witness is 80% accurate and half of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52.}
