{probability: 0.55, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that he is indeed that tall is 0.8 (a). The likelihood that the first witness would incorrectly identify a shorter person as 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (a). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.55.}
