{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from information "a") that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80 (from information "b"). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.80) / [(0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20)] = 0.56.}
