Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Let's denote:
E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
T1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(E): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.
P(T1|E): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information a.
P(T1|~E): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information a.

We want to find P(E|T1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(E|T1) = [P(T1|E) * P(E)] / [P(T1|E) * P(E) + P(T1|~E) * P(~E)]

Plugging in the values:
P(E|T1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.46 or 46%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.46}
