{probability: 0.47,

Explanation:
We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let E1 and E2 be the events that the first and second witness, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|E1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

From the information given, we have:
P(E1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(E1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|E1) = [P(E1|A) * P(A)] / [P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values: P(A|E1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.47
