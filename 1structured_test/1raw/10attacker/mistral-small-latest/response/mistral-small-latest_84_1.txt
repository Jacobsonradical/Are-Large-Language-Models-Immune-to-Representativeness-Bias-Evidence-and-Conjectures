{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.54.}
