{probability: 0.61, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate (0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the population distribution) and the witness's reliability (0.8 probability of the witness being correct when the person is 185 cm or taller). The final probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.61}
