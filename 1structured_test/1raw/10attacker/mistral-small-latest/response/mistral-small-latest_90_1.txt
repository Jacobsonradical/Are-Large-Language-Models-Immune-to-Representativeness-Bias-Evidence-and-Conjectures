{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness (80%) and the prevalence of people 185 cm or taller in the population (15%). The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness was incorrect. The probability of the second witness being incorrect about a person who is 185 cm or taller is 0.30. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness was incorrect is 0.15 * 0.30 = 0.045. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.64.}
