{probability: 0.64, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from the population statistics). The likelihood of the first witness's statement given the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from the witness's accuracy). The likelihood of the first witness's statement given the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the error rate). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.64.}
