{probability: 0.57, This is based on the Bayes' theorem and the given information. The prior probability (given in b) is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (given in a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.57}
