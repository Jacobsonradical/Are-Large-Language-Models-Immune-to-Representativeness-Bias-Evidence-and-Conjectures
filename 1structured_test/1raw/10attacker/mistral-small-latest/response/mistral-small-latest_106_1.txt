{probability: 0.58, given the information provided, the first witness has a higher accuracy rate (80% vs 70%) and the population distribution leans towards shorter individuals (85% vs 15%), but the witness's claim goes against the population majority. Therefore, considering both the witness's accuracy and the population distribution, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.58.}
