{probability: 0.56, The first witness is more reliable than the second one in estimating height. Given that the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is done by using Bayes' theorem. The calculation is as follows: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims so) = [P(Witness 1 claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 1 claims so). This results in a probability of approximately 0.56.}
