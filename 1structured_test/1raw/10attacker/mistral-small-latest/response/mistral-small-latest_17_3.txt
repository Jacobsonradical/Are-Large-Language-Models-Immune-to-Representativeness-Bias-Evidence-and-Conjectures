Based on the information provided, we can calculate the estimate using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.
- P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information a.
- P(W1|~A) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information a.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(~A)]

Since P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and using the given probabilities, we can calculate P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.43.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.43}
