{probability: 0.68, based on the given information and assuming the witnesses are independent and unbiased, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given the population distribution and the witnesses' accuracy rates, the estimated probability is approximately 0.68.}
