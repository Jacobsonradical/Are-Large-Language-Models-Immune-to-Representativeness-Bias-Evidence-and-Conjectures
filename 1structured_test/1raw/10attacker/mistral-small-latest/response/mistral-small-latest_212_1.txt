{probability: 0.48, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy rates of the witnesses and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider that the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, disagreed with the first witness. So, the probability that the second witness was wrong when he said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.48.}
