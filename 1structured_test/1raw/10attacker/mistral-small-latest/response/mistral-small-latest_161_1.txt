{probability: 0.51, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate of the population (0.15 for 185 cm or taller) and the reliability of the first witness (0.80 for correctly identifying the height). The product of these two probabilities gives the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.}
