The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- E: the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|E), the probability of H given E.

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)

From the information given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(E|H) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(E), we need to consider both the cases where the attacker is 185 cm or taller and where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
- P(E|H) * P(H) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12
- P(E|not H) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when he is actually shorter. This is an error, so P(E|not H) = 0.2 (20% of the time the first witness makes an error when the person is shorter than 185 cm). P(not H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). So, P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17

Therefore, P(E) = P(E|H) * P(H) + P(E|not H) * P(not H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.41

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.41}.
