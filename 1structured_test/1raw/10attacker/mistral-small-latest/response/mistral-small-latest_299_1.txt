{probability: 0.625,

Here's the reasoning:

Given information a, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Given information b, the first witness is correct in 80% of the cases, so the probability they are correct in this case is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, the first witness could also be correct even if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of the attacker being shorter and the first witness making an error (claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.

So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (either the attacker really is that tall or the first witness made an error) is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, we also need to consider the second witness's testimony. The probability that the second witness is correct (meaning the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.595.

Since these are conflicting testimonies, we can assume they are independent events. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.595) = approximately 0.625.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.625.
