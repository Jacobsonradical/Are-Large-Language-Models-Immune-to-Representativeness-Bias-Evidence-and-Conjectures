{probability: 0.52, This is a Bayesian probability problem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller if they were, is 0.8. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller if they were not, is 0.2. Applying Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.52.}
