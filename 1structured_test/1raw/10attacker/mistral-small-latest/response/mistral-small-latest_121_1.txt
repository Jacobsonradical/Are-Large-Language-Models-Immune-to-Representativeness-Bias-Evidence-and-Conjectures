{probability: 0.656, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is correct in 80% of similar cases. So, the probability that the witness is correct in this case is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also be incorrect in estimating the height of a person who is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this happening is 0.85 (probability that the attacker is shorter) * 0.2 (probability that the witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.17. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.656.}
