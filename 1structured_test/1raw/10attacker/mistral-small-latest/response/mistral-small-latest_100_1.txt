{probability: 0.55, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness (80%) and the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller (15%). To account for the witness's potential error, we subtract the error rate (20%) from their accuracy (80%), giving us 60% as the adjusted accuracy. Then, we multiply this adjusted accuracy by the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller, resulting in an estimated probability of 0.55.}
