{probability: 0.56,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the attacker's height could be either shorter than 185 cm or 185 cm or taller.
2. The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15 (from information "a").
3. The first witness is correct about the height in 80% of the cases and incorrect in 20% of the cases.
4. So, if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness would correctly identify this is 0.8.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identified this is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
6. However, the witness could also have correctly identified the attacker's height if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm but the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
7. Given the witness's error rate, the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as taller is 0.2 (the error rate) * 0.5 (the probability that the person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.1.
8. Adding these two probabilities gives the total probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.56.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.56.
