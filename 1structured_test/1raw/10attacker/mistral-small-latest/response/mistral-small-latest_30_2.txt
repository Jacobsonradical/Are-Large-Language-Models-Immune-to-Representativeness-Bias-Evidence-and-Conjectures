{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, claimed that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W1|~A) as the probability that the first witness is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(~A) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Then, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|~A) \* P(~A)]. Plugging in the values, we get P(A|W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85] = 0.64.}
