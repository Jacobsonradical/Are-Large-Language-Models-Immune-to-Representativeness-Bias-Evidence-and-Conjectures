{probability: 0.62, explanation: The first witness is more reliable, with an 80% accuracy rate. Given the general population distribution in the city, 85% of people are shorter than 185 cm. However, since the witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to account for the witness's error rate. So, out of the 15% of people who are 185 cm or taller, the witness correctly identifies about 80% of them (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12). The witness also misidentifies 20% of the people who are actually shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17). Adding these two probabilities gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, this is the probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, not the actual probability of the attacker being that tall. To find the actual probability, we need to account for the witness's accuracy. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.29 / 0.8 = 0.62.}
