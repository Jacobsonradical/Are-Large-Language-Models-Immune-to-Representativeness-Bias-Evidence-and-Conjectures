Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses respectively claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time), P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm), and P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the given probabilities, we get P(A|B1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.36}.
