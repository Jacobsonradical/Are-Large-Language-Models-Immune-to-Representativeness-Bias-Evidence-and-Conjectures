{probability: 0.58, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. Given that the first witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying heights, and the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, the posterior probability (or the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller) can be calculated as follows: (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.58}
