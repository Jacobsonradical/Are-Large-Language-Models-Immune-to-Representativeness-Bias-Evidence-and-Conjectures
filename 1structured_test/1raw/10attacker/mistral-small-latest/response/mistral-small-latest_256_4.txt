{probability: 0.55, Given the conflicting testimonies and the witness's error rates, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The base rate of people taller than 185 cm in the city is 0.15. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate, correctly identified the attacker as taller. This means the probability of the attacker actually being taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.55.}
