Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- P(A) as the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 (80%).
- P(W1|not A) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 (20%).

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

P(not A) is the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85%).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|W1) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.36

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36.

Answer: {probability: 0.36}
