{probability: 0.53, explanation: Given the Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that he actually was, is 0.8 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability can be calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.53.}
