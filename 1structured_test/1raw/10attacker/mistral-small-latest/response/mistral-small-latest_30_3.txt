{probability: 0.625}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying a person's height, and a 20% chance of making an error.
2. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the first witness correctly identifies this.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness is correct is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
5. However, the first witness could also identify a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes an error 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
6. The total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
7. However, we need to account for the fact that the second witness also saw the attacker. Since the second witness has a 30% error rate, there's a 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045 probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter.
8. Therefore, the probability that both witnesses agree that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker actually is that tall, is 0.12 * (1 - 0.045) = 0.1155.
9. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses agree, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. The probability that both witnesses agree, given any height, is 0.7 * 0.8 + 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.58. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that both witnesses agree, is 0.1155 / 0.58 = approximately 0.625.
