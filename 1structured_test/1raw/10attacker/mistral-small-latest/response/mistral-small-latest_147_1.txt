{probability: 0.58, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:
1. Let's assume that P(T) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(S) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
2. Given the information provided in (b), P(T) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85.
3. The first witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying people taller than 185 cm and a 20% error rate. So, the probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is taller is 0.8, and the probability of being wrong is 0.2.
4. Similarly, the second witness has a 30% error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. So, the probability that the witness is correct when the attacker is shorter is 0.7.
5. We can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is taller given that the first witness claimed so: P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) / P(W1)
6. P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|S) * P(S)
7. P(W1|S) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is taller when he is actually shorter. This can be calculated as the error rate of the first witness when the attacker is shorter: 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17
8. Now we can calculate P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.2025
9. Finally, we can calculate P(T|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.2025 ≈ 0.58

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.58.
