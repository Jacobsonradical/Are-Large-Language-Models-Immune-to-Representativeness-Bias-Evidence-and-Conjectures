{probability: 0.67,

Explanation: This is a conditional probability problem. We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so.

Let's denote:
H = the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1 = the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(H|W1), which can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / P(W1)

From the problem, we know that P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller), and P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller).

To find P(W1), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height:
P(W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|not H) * P(not H)

P(not H) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm).
P(W1|not H) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Substituting these values, we get:
P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Finally, P(H|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.375 = 0.67 (rounded to two decimal places).

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.67.}
