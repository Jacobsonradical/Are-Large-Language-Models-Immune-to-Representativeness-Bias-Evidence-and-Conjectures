{probability: 0.45, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The probability that the first witness would identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller if that was the case is 0.8 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.45.}
