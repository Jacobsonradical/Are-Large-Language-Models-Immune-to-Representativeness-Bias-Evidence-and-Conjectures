{probability: 0.54, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of 15% for people 185 cm or taller in the city and the first witness's accuracy of 80% when identifying such individuals, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is approximately 0.54.}
