{probability: 0.615,

Here's the reasoning:

Let's assume that the attacker's height is a random variable and that the distribution of heights in the city is representative of the attacker's height.

Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85, and the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

The first witness has an 80% chance of being correct when the person is 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance of being incorrect. The second witness has a 30% chance of being correct when the person is shorter than 185 cm and a 70% chance of being incorrect.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = [P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80 (the first witness's accuracy)
P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20 (the first witness's error rate when the person is shorter)

Substituting, we get:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85] â‰ˆ 0.615

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.615.
