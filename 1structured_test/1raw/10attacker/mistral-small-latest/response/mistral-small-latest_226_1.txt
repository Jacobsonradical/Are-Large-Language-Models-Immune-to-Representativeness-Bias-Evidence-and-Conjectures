{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the population distribution is 85% shorter and 15% taller than 185 cm, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56. This is calculated by multiplying the witness's accuracy rate (0.8) by the actual probability of an attacker being taller than 185 cm (0.15), which equals 0.12. However, since there are two contradicting testimonies, we also need to consider the second witness's error rate (0.3). Given that the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time and the actual probability of an attacker being shorter is 0.85, the probability of the second witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is taller is 0.255. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker is taller is the sum of the first witness's correct estimate and the second witness's incorrect estimate, which is approximately 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.56.}
