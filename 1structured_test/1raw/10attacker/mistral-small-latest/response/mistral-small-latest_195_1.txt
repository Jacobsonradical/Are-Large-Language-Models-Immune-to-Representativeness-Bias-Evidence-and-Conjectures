{probability: 0.558, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from b). The likelihood of the first witness's claim given the attacker's height is 0.8 (from a). So, the probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (from b), and the likelihood of the first witness's claim given this is the error rate of the first witness, which is 0.2 (from a). So, this probability is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. The total probability of the first witness's claim is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is the first probability divided by the total probability, which is 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.558.}
