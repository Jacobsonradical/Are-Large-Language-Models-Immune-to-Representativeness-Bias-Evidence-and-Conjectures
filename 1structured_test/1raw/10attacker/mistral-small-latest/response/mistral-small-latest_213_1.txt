{probability: 0.55, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate of the population (0.15 for people 185 cm or taller) and adjusting it based on the witness's reliability. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so we multiply the base rate by 0.8 to get 0.12. However, the witness also makes mistakes when people are shorter, so we need to account for that. The probability of the witness incorrectly saying the person is taller when they are actually shorter is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.1 = 0.55 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
