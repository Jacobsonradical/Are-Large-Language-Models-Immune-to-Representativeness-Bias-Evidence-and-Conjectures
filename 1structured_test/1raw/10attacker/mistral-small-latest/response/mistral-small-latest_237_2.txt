{probability: 0.54, explanation: This is a probability problem that involves Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, so the likelihood of the witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim is 0.15*0.8 / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.54.}
