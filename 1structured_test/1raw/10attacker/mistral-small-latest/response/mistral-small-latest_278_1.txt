{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by considering the two witnesses' reliability and the city's general height distribution. The first witness's 80% accuracy in identifying heights suggests that, out of 100 people in the city of whom 85 are shorter than 185 cm, the witness would correctly identify 85*0.8 = 68 short people and incorrectly identify 15 tall people as short (15*0.2 = 3). Therefore, the witness would identify 68 short + 15 correct = 83 people as short. However, the witness claimed the attacker was tall. This means the witness's "tall" identification was likely one of the 15 tall people in the city, and not one of the short people misidentified as tall (since the witness made no such claim). Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 15 out of the total 100 people, which equals 0.68.}
