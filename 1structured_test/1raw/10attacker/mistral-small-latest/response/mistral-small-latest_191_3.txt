{probability: 0.768,

Explanation:
Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The first witness correctly identified the height in 80% of the cases, so we multiply the base probability by this accuracy to get an estimated probability of 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, since the second witness also gave a contradictory account, we need to consider their testimony as well. They were correct 70% of the time, so they would have incorrectly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.3.

Given that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller with a base probability of 0.15, the probability that the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height is 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045.

So the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, despite the second witness's claim, is the sum of the probabilities of both witnesses being correct, or 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.165.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that both witnesses made mistakes. The probability of both witnesses making a mistake is 0.15 * 0.2 (first witness's error rate) * 0.7 (second witness's correct rate) + 0.85 * 0.3 (second witness's error rate) * 0.2 (first witness's error rate) = 0.042 + 0.051 = 0.093.

Subtracting this double mistake probability from the sum of the individual correct probabilities gives the final estimate: 0.165 - 0.093 = 0.768.}
