Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height: P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  - P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not. This is the false positive rate, which is 1 - P(correct when not A) = 1 - 0.7 (since the witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.3
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
  - So, P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 ≈ 0.355

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.355 ≈ 0.338

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.338.

Answer: {probability: 0.338}
