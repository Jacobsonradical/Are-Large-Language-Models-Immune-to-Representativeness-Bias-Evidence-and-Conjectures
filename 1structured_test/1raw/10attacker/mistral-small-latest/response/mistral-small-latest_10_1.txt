{probability: 0.481, given the information provided, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 48.1%}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the attacker's height is a random variable.
2. According to the data, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population is 0.15 (15%).
3. Now let's consider the witnesses' statements. The first witness correctly identifies people's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
4. Similarly, the probability that the first witness is incorrect given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.2 (20%).
5. We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so: P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) = [P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall)] / P(Witness 1 says tall)
6. To calculate P(Witness 1 says tall), we need to consider both scenarios where the attacker is tall and where the attacker is short. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, the probability that the first witness says tall given that the attacker is short is 0.17 (0.85 * 0.2).
7. Therefore, P(Witness 1 says tall) = P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is tall) * P(Attacker is tall) + P(Witness 1 says tall | Attacker is short) * P(Attacker is short) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 ≈ 0.3025
8. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says tall) ≈ 0.481.
