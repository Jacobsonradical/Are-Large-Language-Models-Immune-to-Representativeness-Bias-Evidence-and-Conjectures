{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is calculated as follows. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is correct in 80% of cases under similar conditions. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, but the second witness incorrectly claims otherwise. The second witness is wrong in 30% of cases when the person is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability of this happening is 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045. Adding these two probabilities together, we get 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.64 as our estimate.
