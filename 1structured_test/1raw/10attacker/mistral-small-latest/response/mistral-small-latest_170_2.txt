{probability: 0.68, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are actually that height is 0.8 (their accuracy rate). So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.68.}
