{probability: 0.588, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter is 0.85. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability that they correctly identified a taller attacker is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The second witness is wrong 30% of the time, so the probability that they misidentified a shorter attacker as taller is 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.255. Adding these probabilities together gives us the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is approximately 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.588.}
