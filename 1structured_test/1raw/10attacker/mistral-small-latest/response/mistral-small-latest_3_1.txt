{probability: 0.51, This estimate is calculated based on the Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that he is indeed that tall, is 0.8. The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that he is shorter, is 0.2 (this is the error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is (0.8*0.15) / ((0.8*0.15) + (0.2*0.85)) = approximately 0.51.}
