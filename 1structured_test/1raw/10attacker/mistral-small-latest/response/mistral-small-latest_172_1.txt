{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The base rate of people 185 cm or taller in the city is 0.15. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.56}
