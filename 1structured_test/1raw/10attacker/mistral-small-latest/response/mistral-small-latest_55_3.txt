{probability: 0.65,

Explanation: This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(A).

Given the information, we know that the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the general population is 0.15 (from information b). This is our prior probability, P(A) = 0.15.

The first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed that tall is P(W1|A) = 0.8.

The probability of the witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter is P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (this is the error rate).

We can now calculate the posterior probability, P(A|W1), using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] ≈ 0.65}
