Based on the information provided, we can calculate an estimate using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information "a"
- P(W1|A): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information "b"
- P(W1|not A): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 according to information "b" (chance of misclassifying a shorter person as taller)

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, we can plug in the values:
P(A|W1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get approximately 0.36.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: {probability: 0.36}
