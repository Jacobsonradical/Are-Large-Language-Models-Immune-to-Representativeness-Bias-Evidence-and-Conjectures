{probability: 0.62, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.62. This is calculated using Bayes' theorem, considering the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), the accuracy of the first witness (0.8), and the accuracy of the second witness (0.7).}
