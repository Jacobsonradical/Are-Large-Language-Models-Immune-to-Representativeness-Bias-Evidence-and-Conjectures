{probability: 0.55, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate of the population (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller) and the reliability of the first witness (80% accurate, 20% error). Assuming the witness's errors are random, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller despite the witness's errors is (15% * 0.8) + (85% * 0.2) = 0.55 or 55%.}
