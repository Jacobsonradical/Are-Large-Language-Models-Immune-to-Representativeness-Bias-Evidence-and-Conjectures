{probability: 0.58, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)), which is approximately 0.58.}
