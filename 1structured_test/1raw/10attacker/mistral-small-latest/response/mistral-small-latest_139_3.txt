{probability: 0.55, given the conflicting testimonies and the witnesses' accuracy rates, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.55}

This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability, based on information b, is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony given the attacker is taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). The likelihood of the second witness's testimony given the attacker is taller is 0.3 (the error rate of the second witness). Multiplying these together and normalizing gives an estimated probability of 0.55.
