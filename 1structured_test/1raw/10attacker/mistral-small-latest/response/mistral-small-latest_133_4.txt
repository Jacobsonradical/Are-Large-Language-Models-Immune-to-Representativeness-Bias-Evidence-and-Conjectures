{probability: 0.752, given the information provided and assuming the witnesses are independent, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). The likelihood of the first witness's statement given the attacker's height is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate). So, the probability can be calculated as 0.15 * 0.8 â‰ˆ 0.752}
