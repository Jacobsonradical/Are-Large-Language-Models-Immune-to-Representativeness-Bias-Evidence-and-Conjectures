{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: We can use Bayes' theorem to solve this problem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E1, E2 as the events that the first and second witness respectively claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know from (a) that the prior probability P(A) = 0.15.

From (b), we know that the probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person's height when they are 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%), so P(E1|A) = 0.8. Similarly, the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a person's height when they are shorter is 0.2 (20%), so P(E1|not A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(A|E1) = [P(E1|A) * P(A)] / [P(E1|A) * P(A) + P(E1|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get P(A|E1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.64.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.64.}
