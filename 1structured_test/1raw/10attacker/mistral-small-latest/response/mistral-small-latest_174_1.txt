{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of 0.15 that a person is 185 cm or taller in the city, the likelihood of the first witness's correct identification (0.8) and incorrect identification (0.2), and the likelihood of the second witness's correct identification (0.7) and incorrect identification (0.3), the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.}
