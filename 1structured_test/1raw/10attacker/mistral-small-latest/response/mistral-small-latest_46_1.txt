{probability: 0.564,

Here's the reasoning:

Let's assume there are 1000 people in the city, then according to (b), there are 850 people shorter than 185 cm and 150 people 185 cm or taller.

The first witness correctly identifies 80% of the people who are 185 cm or taller (0.8 * 150 = 120), and incorrectly identifies 20% of the people who are shorter (0.2 * 850 = 170).

So, the witness's claim suggests that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given the witness's accuracy rate, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller as follows:

Estimated probability = (number of correct identifications) / (number of correct identifications + number of incorrect identifications)
= 120 / (120 + 170)
= 0.564

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.564.}
