{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate, identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, is approximately 0.56.}
