Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's assume the event A is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the event W1 is that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know from the information that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, so P(W1|~A) = 0.2 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|~A) * P(~A)].

Substituting the values, we get P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.46.

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.46}.
