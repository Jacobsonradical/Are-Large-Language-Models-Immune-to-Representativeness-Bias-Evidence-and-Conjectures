{probability: 0.512,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the population distribution in the city is representative of the attacker's height.
2. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.
3. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is therefore 0.15.
4. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
5. The witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is shorter is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.17) = 0.512.
