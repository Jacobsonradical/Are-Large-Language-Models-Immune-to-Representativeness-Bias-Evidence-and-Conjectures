{probability: 0.61, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem, which takes into account the base rate of the population (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), the reliability of the first witness (80% correct, 20% error), and the contradictory evidence of the second witness (70% correct, 30% error).}
