{probability: 0.63, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (based on b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are, is 0.8 (from a). The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, is 0.2 (also from a). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.63.}
