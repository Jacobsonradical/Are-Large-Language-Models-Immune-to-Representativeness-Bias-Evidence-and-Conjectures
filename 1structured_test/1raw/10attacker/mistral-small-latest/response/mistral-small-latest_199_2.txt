{probability: 0.55, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (from information a). Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives an estimated probability of 0.55 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.}
