{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the conditions are similar, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (given the witness's claim) can be calculated as follows: 15% (the proportion of the population 185 cm or taller) * (80% / 80% + 20% * 15% / 85%) = 0.56 or 56%.}
