{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% (0.15), according to the demographic information. The likelihood of the first witness's observation given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 80% (0.8). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56.}
