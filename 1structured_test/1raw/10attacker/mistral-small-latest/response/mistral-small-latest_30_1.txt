{probability: 0.48, explanation: The base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller is 15%. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, the witness also has a 20% chance of being incorrect when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which happens with a probability of 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm). So the probability of the witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, when they're not, is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.48.}
