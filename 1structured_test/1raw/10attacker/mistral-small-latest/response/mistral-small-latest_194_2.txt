{probability: 0.60, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of the population (0.15 for being 185 cm or taller), the first witness's accuracy (0.80), and error rate (0.20), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.60.}
