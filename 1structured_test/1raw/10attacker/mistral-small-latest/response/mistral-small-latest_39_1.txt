{probability: 0.56, The first witness had an 80% accuracy rate in identifying the correct height of people in similar conditions. Given that the population distribution is 85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. Let's denote P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) as P(A|W1). Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1). Here, P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of population 185 cm or taller), and P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41. Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 â‰ˆ 0.56.}
