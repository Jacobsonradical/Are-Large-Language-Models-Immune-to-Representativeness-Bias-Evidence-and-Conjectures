{probability: 0.48, Note: This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The base rate of the population being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would correctly identify a person of this height is 0.8. So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.48.}
