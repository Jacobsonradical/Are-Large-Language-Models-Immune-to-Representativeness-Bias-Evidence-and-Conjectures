{probability: 0.47, explanation: Given the information, we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W1) as the probability that the first witness is correct, P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(A|W1) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness is correct. According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1). We know that P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy), P(A) = 0.15 (the population distribution), and P(W1) can be calculated as P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.29. Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.47.}
