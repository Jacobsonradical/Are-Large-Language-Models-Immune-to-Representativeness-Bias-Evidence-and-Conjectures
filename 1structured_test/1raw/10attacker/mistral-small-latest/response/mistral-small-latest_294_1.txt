{probability: 0.58, This estimate is calculated by applying Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.85 and the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate, correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness said so is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.58.}
