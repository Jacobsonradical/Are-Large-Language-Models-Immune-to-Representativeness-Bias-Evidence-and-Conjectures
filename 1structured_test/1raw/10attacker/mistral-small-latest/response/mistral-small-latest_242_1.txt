{probability: 0.67, explanation: Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, and half of the population is 185 cm or taller, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) times 0.5 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller) = 0.67 or 67%.}
