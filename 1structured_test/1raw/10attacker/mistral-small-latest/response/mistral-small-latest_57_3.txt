{probability: 0.62, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is right 80% of the time, reported the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.62.}
