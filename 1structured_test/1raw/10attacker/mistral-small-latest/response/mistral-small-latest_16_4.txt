{probability: 0.49, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are that height, is 0.8. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not that height, is 0.2 (their error rate). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.49.}
