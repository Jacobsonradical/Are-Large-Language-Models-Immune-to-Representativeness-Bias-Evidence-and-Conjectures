Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. We know that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when assessing whether someone is 185 cm or taller.
2. However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm. This means that if the witness were to randomly guess, they would be correct (saying the person is shorter than 185 cm) 85% of the time due to the population distribution.
3. Given that the witness said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider how likely this statement is given the witness's accuracy and the population distribution.
4. If the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, then the witness's 80% accuracy means they would correctly identify this 80% of the time. Given that the attacker is in the 15% taller population, the probability of the witness's statement being correct is therefore 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12, or 12%.

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.12.

Therefore, {probability: 0.12}
