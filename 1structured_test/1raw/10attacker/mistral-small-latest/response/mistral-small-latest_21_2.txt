{probability: 0.58, Given the information, let's apply Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability. Let's denote H as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E1 and E2 as the events that the first and second witnesses correctly identified the height, respectively.

P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(E1|H) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(E1|not H) = 0.2 (since the witness erred in 20% of cases where the person was shorter than 185 cm)
P(E2|H) = 0.3 (from information a)
P(E2|not H) = 0.7 (since the witness correctly identified the height in 70% of cases where the person was shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H|E1).

P(H|E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) / P(E1)

P(E1) = P(E1|H) * P(H) + P(E1|not H) * P(not H)
P(E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22

So, P(H|E1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.58}
