{probability: 0.58,

Explanation:

Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We know from the information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W1), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)

We know P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
And P(W1|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter. This is 1 - P(W1'|not A) = 0.2

So, P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 ≈ 0.24 + 0.17 = 0.41

Finally, P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.41 ≈ 0.58

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.58.}
