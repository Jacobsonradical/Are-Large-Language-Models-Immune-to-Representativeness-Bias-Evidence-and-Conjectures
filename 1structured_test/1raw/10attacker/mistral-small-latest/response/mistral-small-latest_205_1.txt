{probability: 0.52, This is based on the Bayes' theorem, considering the base rate of the population (0.15 for 185 cm or taller), the accuracy of the first witness (0.8 for correctly identifying the height), and the error rate of the second witness (0.3 for incorrectly claiming the height is shorter than 185 cm).}
