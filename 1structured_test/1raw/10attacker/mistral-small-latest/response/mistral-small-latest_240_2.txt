The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15 (probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller). The first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. The witness also makes errors 20% of the time, so if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (event not-A), the witness would still claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2. Therefore, P(B|not-A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not-A) * P(not-A)]

Since P(not-A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85,

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.428571...

So, the estimate is: {probability: 0.429, rounding to three decimal places}
