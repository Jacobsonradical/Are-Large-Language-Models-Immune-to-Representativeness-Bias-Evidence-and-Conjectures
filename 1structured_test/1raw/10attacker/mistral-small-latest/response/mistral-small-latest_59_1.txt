{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the population distribution in the city applies to the attacker as well. So, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of cases and makes a mistake in 20% of cases.
3. So, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance that the witness will correctly claim so.
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
5. However, the witness could also have correctly identified the attacker's height even if he was shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter, and the witness correctly identifies this height in 20% of cases, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17.
6. But this is not the scenario we're interested in, so we subtract this from our total probability.
7. Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 - 0.17 = -0.05.
8. Since probability cannot be negative, we correct this by considering that the total probability shouldn't exceed 1. So, the actual probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.64.
