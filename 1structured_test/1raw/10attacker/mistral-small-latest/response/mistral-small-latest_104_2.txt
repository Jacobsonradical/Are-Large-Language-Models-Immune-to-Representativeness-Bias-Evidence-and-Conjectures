{probability: 0.53, explanation: Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. The prior probability (from information "a") that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that he actually is, is 0.8 (from information "b"). The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that he actually isn't, is 0.2 (the error rate from information "b"). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.53.}
