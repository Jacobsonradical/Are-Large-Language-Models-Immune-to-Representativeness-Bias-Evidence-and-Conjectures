{probability: 0.56, The first witness is more reliable with an 80% accuracy rate. Given that the attacker's height is evenly distributed in the population, there's a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Multiplying this with the first witness's accuracy (0.8) gives us approximately 0.56 or 56% probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.}
