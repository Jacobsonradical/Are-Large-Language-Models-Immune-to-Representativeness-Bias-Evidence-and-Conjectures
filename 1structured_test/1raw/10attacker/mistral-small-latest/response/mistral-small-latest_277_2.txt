{probability: 0.62, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%), and the likelihood that the first witness would correctly identify the attacker's height given that he is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). Therefore, the posterior probability is approximately 0.62.}
