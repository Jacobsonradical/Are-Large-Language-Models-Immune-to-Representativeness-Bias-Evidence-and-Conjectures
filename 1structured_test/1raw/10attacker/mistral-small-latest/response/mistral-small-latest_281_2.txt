{probability: 0.44, Based on the given information, we first need to calculate the probability that each witness is correct given that they made a claim. For the first witness, the probability of being correct given the claim is 0.8 (since they are correct 80% of the time). The probability of them being incorrect given the claim is 0.2. Similarly, for the second witness, the probability of being correct given the claim is 0.7, and the probability of being incorrect given the claim is 0.3.

Given that the witnesses made contradictory claims, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our probability estimate based on the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (as given in the second piece of information).

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 be the events that the first and second witnesses are correct, respectively. We want to find P(A|W1, W2').

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1, W2') = P(W1|A, W2') * P(A|W2') / P(W1|W2').

We can calculate P(W1|A, W2') as 0.8 (the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness is incorrect), P(A|W2') as 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045 (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the second witness is incorrect), and P(W1|W2') as 0.8 * 0.85 + 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.71 (the probability that the first witness is correct given that the second witness is incorrect).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W1, W2') â‰ˆ 0.44.}
