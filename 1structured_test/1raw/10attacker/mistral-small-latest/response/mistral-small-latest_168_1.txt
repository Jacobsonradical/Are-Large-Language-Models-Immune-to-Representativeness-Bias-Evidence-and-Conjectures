{probability: 0.68, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be estimated by considering the base rate of the population and the witness's accuracy. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the first witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying heights, the estimated probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the first witness correctly identified a tall attacker when the second witness made an error. Given that 50% of the population is 185 cm or taller according to the sample the witnesses were tested on, and the second witness makes errors 30% of the time, the probability of the second witness making an error about a tall person is 0.5 * 0.3 = 0.15. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.15 = 0.68.}
