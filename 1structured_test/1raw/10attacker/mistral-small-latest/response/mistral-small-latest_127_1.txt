{probability: 0.62, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of the population (85% shorter than 185 cm), the accuracy of the witnesses, and the conflicting testimonies, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.62.}
