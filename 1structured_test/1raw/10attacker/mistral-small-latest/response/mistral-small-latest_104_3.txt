{probability: 0.5667, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we initially have a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct about 80% of the time under similar conditions, said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement is calculated as follows: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12 or 12%. However, the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, contradicted the first witness, saying the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this witness being correct about a taller person is 0.3 (their error rate), so the probability that the attacker is actually shorter given the second witness's statement is 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255 or 25.5%. Since these are the only two possibilities and they are mutually exclusive, we add these probabilities together and then divide by the sum to get our final estimate: (0.12 + 0.255) / (0.12 + 0.255 + 0.025) â‰ˆ 0.5667.}
