{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the first witness has an 80% accuracy in identifying heights, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12 probability that the witness correctly identified a taller person. However, there's also a 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17 probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as being taller. Therefore, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.64.}
