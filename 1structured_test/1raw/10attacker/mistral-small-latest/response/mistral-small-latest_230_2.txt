{probability: 0.55, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability of 15% for a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, and the first witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying heights, the posterior probability (estimate) that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.55.}
