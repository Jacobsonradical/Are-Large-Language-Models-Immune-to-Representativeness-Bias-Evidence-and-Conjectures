{probability: 0.592, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%). The probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.592. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.592.}
