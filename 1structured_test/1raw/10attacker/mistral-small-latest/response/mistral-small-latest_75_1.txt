{probability: 0.55, This estimate is calculated by considering the witness's accuracy and the general population's height distribution. The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people who are 185 cm or taller. However, only 15% of the population is this tall. So, the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. But we also need to consider the probability that the attacker is this tall, which is 0.15 according to the population distribution. Therefore, the overall probability that the witness is correct and the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability that the witness is incorrect but the attacker is still this tall is 0.2 * 0.15 = 0.03. Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimate of 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.55.}
