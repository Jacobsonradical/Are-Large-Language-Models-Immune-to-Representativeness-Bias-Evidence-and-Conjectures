{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the population distribution is 85% shorter and 15% taller, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is taller given that the witness said so. This is a Bayesian inference problem. The witness saying the attacker is taller is a positive test result. Using Bayes' theorem, P(taller|positive) = [P(positive|taller)*P(taller)] / P(positive). We know P(positive|taller) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy when the person is taller), P(taller) = 0.15 (from the population distribution), and P(positive) can be calculated using total probability: P(positive) = P(positive|taller)*P(taller) + P(positive|shorter)*P(shorter) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.28. So, P(taller|positive) = [0.8*0.15] / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.64.}
