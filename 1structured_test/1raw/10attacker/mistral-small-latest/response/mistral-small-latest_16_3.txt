{probability: 0.58, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to account for the accuracy of the witnesses. The first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time.
2. Let's assume that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Then, according to the first witness, there is an 80% chance that they will claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. However, the second witness, who is correct 70% of the time, would claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm in this scenario. So there is a 30% chance that the second witness will contradict the first witness.
4. Given the general population distribution in the city, there is an 85% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. But since both witnesses contradict this, we can disregard this probability for now.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, is the probability that the first witness is correct (0.8) multiplied by the probability that the second witness is incorrect (0.3).
6. So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.58 or 58%.
