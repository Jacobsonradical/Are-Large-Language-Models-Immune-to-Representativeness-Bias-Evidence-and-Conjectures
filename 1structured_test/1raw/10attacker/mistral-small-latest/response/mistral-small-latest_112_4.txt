{probability: 0.64}

This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's break it down:

1. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, given the population statistics in the city.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies it 20% of the time.
3. If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies this is 0.8 (80%).
4. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so is calculated as follows: P(attacker is tall | witness says tall) = P(witness says tall | attacker is tall) * P(attacker is tall) / P(witness says tall).
5. P(witness says tall) is the sum of the probabilities of the witness saying tall given the attacker is tall (0.8 * 0.15) and the witness saying tall given the attacker is short (0.2 * 0.85). Calculating this gives approximately 0.22.
6. Plugging these values into the formula above gives a probability of approximately 0.64.
