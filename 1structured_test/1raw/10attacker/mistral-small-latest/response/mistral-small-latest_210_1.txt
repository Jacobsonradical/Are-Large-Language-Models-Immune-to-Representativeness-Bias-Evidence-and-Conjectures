Explanation:

First, we need to find the probabilities that the witnesses are correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. For the first witness, the probability of being correct is 0.80 (since they are correct 80% of the time).

Next, we need to find the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness is incorrect 20% of the time, the probability of the witness being incorrect (and thus the attacker being shorter) is 0.20.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Let's denote P(A) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(W1) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

We know from the information given that P(A) = 0.15 and P(not A) = 0.85. We also found that P(W1|A) = 0.80 and P(W1|not A) = 0.20.

So,
P(A|W1) = [0.80 * 0.15] / [0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85]
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.57

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.57.
