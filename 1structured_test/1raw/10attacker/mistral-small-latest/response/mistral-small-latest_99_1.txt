{probability: 0.72, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city) is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they actually were, is 0.8. The likelihood that the first witness would say the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they actually were not, is the probability they were wrong, which is 0.2. So, the posterior probability (the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement) is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.72.}
