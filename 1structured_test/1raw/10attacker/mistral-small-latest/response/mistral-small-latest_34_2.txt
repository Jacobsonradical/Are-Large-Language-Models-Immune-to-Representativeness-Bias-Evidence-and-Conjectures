{probability: 0.58, this estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem which takes into account both the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city (0.15), and the witness's accuracy (0.8) in identifying heights under similar conditions. The calculation is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.3)) = 0.58}
