{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from b) that the attacker is taller than 185 cm is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's statement given that the attacker is taller is 0.8 (from a). The likelihood of the first witness's statement given that the attacker is shorter is 0.2 (also from a). So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.54.}
