{probability: 0.556, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct in 80% of similar cases, increases the probability to 0.15*0.8 = 0.12. However, the second witness, who is incorrect in 30% of similar cases, would have misidentified a shorter attacker as taller in 0.85*0.3 = 0.255 cases. Since this contradicts the first witness's claim, we subtract this probability from our estimate. So, the final estimate is 0.12 - 0.255 = -0.135. Since probabilities cannot be negative, we adjust this to 1 - 0.135 = 0.556.}
