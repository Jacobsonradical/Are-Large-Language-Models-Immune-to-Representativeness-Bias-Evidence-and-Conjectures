{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the base rate for the attacker being shorter is 0.85. The first witness is correct in identifying the height 80% of the time, so if the attacker was indeed shorter than 185 cm, there's an 80% chance the witness would say so. That gives us a probability of 0.85 * 0.8 = 0.68 for the witness saying the attacker is shorter. Since the witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability for the attacker actually being that tall is the complement of the probability that the witness would say the attacker is shorter, which is 1 - 0.68 = 0.32. However, the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, so there's a chance the witness said the attacker is taller even though he's not. This happens with a probability of 0.15 (the base rate of tall people) * 0.2 (the error rate of the first witness) = 0.03. Adding this to our previous probability gives us a final estimate of 0.32 + 0.03 = 0.64.}
