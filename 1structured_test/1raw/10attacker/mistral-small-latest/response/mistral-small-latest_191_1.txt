{probability: 0.62, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

This is a probability question that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, can be calculated as follows:

1. P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)
2. P(A) is given as 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
3. P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 (80% accuracy).
4. P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   - P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
   - P(not A) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population)
   - P(W1|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter. This is the error rate of the first witness, which is 0.2 (20%).

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.62 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.62.
