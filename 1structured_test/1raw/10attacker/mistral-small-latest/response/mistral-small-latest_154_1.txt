{probability: 0.54, Based on the given information, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The first witness has an accuracy of 80% when identifying individuals of this height. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.54 or 54%.}
