{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from the population distribution) is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy rate), and the likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (the witness's error rate). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56.}
