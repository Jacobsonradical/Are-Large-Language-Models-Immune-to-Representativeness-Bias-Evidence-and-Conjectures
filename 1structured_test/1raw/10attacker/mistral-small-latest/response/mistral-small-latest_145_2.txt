{probability: 0.64,

Explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, has an 80% accuracy in identifying the correct height. Therefore, the probability that the witness was correct when claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller can be calculated as the product of the base probability and the witness's accuracy: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12.

However, the witness could also have made a correct identification of a taller attacker when the attacker was actually taller. The probability of this happening is the product of the base probability of the attacker being taller (0.15) and the witness's error rate in identifying shorter people as taller (0.20): 0.15 * 0.20 = 0.03.

Adding these two probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.03 = 0.15 that the witness was correct and the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

However, we also need to consider the witness's false positive rate, which is the probability that the witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as taller. This is the product of the base probability of the attacker being shorter (0.85) and the witness's error rate in identifying shorter people as taller (0.20): 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17.

To get the final estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the witness claimed so is the probability of the witness being correct (0.15) divided by the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct (0.15) and making a false positive identification (0.17): 0.15 / (0.15 + 0.17) = 0.64.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.64.}
