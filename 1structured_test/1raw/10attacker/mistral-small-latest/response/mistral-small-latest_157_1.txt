{probability: 0.64}

Here's the reasoning:

1. The base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%.
2. The first witness is correct in identifying the correct height about 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
3. If the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the witness correctly identifies him as such is 0.8.
4. However, if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, there's still a chance that the witness could incorrectly identify him as being 185 cm or taller. Since the witness makes a mistake 20% of the time, the probability of him incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller is 0.2.
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed he was: P(tall|witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) / P(witness)
6. P(witness) = P(witness|tall) * P(tall) + P(witness|short) * P(short)
7. P(witness|short) = probability of the witness incorrectly identifying a shorter person as taller, which is 0.2. P(short) is 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
8. So, P(witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
9. Therefore, P(tall|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.64.
