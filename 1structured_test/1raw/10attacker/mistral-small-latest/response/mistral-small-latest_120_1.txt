{probability: 0.58,

Explanation: Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 the event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (from information a, the first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time)
P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (from information a, the first witness erred in 20% of the cases)
P(not A) = 0.85 (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

Plugging in the values: P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] = 0.58}
