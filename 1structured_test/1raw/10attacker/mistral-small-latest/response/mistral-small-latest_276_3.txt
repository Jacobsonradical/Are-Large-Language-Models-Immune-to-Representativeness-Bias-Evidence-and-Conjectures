Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height is 0.8, and the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height is 0.2. So, P(B1|A) = 0.8 and P(B1|not A) = 0.2.

We want to find P(A|B1), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / P(B1)

We can find P(B1) using the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)
       = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
       = 0.21 + 0.17
       = 0.38

So, P(A|B1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.38 â‰ˆ 0.29

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.29.

Final answer: {probability: 0.29}
