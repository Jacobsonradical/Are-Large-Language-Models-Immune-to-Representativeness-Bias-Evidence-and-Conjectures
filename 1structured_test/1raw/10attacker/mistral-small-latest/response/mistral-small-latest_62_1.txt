{probability: 0.62, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (the error rate). So, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.62.}
