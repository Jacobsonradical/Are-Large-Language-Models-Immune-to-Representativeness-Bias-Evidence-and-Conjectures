{probability: 0.52, This calculation is based on the combined accuracy of the witnesses and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, increases this to 0.8*0.15 = 0.12. The second witness, who is wrong 30% of the time, was wrong in this case, so the probability doesn't decrease. Therefore, the revised probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.38) = 0.52}
