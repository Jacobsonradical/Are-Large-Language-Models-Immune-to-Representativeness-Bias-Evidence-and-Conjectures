Based on the information provided and using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, can be estimated as follows:

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

From the information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Applying Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]
        ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
        ≈ 0.36

So, the estimate is {probability: 0.36}.
