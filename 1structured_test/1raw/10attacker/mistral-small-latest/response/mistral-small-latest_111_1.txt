{probability: 0.65,
Here's the reasoning:

Given the first witness's accuracy rate of 80% and the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, if the witness was right, the probability would be 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.

However, the witness could have also incorrectly identified a shorter person as being 185 cm or taller. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time, the probability of this happening would be 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.

Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.

However, we also need to consider the second witness's testimony. The second witness was correct 70% of the time, so there's a possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the second witness was correct and the attacker was shorter would be 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.6.

Since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive (the attacker cannot be both taller and shorter than 185 cm), we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies by dividing the probability that the first witness was correct by the sum of the probabilities that either witness was correct.

So, the estimate is 0.29 / (0.29 + 0.6) = 0.65. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.65.}
