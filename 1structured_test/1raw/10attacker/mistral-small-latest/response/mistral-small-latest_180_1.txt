{probability: 0.63, The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.63. This is calculated by first considering the base rate of the population (0.15), then applying Bayes' theorem with the reliability of the first witness (0.8) and the reliability of the opposite event (0.2 for the second witness, which is 1 - 0.7).}
