Based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- H: the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(H): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (prior probability, based on information b) = 0.15
- P(W1 | H): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (likelihood) = 0.80
- P(W1 | ¬H): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (likelihood) = 0.20 (since the witness makes errors in 20% of cases)

We want to find P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) * P(H) / [P(W1 | H) * P(H) + P(W1 | ¬H) * P(¬H)]

Since P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we can plug in the values:

P(H | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.385

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.385.

Final answer: {probability: 0.385}
