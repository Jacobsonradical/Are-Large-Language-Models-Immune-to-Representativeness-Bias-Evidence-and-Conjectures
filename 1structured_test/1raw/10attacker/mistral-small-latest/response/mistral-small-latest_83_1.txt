{probability: 0.66, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of the population (0.15 for people 185 cm or taller), the first witness's accuracy (0.8 for correctly identifying taller people), and the second witness's error rate for shorter people (0.3), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.66.}
