{probability: 0.68, Considering the information provided, the base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%. Given the witnesses' abilities to judge height, the first witness is more reliable, with an 80% success rate. Therefore, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.15 (base rate) * 0.8 (first witness's reliability) = 0.68 or 68%.}
