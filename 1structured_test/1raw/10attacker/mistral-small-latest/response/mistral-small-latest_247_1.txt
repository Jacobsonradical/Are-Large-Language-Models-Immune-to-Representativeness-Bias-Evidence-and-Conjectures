{probability: 0.56, Based on the information provided, the first witness is more reliable than the second, with an 80% accuracy rate. However, we also know that the majority of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm. Taking both pieces of information into account, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. The calculation results in a probability of approximately 0.56 or 56%.}
