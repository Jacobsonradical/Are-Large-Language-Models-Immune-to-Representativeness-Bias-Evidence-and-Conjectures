Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:
- E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- T as the testimony of the first witness
- P(E) as the prior probability of E, which is 0.15 (from information b)
- P(T|E) as the probability of the witness being correct given E, which is 0.8 (from information a)
- P(T|not E) as the probability of the witness making a mistake given not E, which is 0.2 (from information a)
- P(not E) as the prior probability of not E, which is 0.85 (from information b)

According to Bayes' theorem, P(E|T) = P(T|E) * P(E) / [P(T|E) * P(E) + P(T|not E) * P(not E)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(E|T) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

Calculating this, we get a probability of approximately 0.30.

So, the answer is {probability: 0.30}
