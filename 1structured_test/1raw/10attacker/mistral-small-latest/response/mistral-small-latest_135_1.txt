Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). We also know that the first witness has an 80% accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We need to find P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

We can calculate P(B) by considering both the possibility that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness is correct, and the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm but the first witness makes a mistake.

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Given that P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm), and the first witness has a 20% error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(B|not A) = 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.565

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.565.

Answer: {probability: 0.565}
