{probability: 0.68, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem and the given probabilities. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness accurately identifying the attacker's height given that he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.68.}
