{probability: 0.66, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, P(W1) be the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(W1|A) be the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. From the given information, P(A) = 0.15, P(W1|A) = 0.8, and P(W1|not A) = 0.2. We can calculate P(W1) using the total probability law: P(W1) = P(W1|A)P(A) + P(W1|not A)P(not A) = 0.8*0.15 + 0.2*0.85 = 0.22. Finally, we can calculate P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem: P(A|W1) = P(W1|A)P(A) / P(W1) = 0.8*0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.66.}
