{probability: 0.53, This estimate is derived by applying Bayes' theorem to the given information. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time and 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is approximately 0.53.}
