{probability: 0.588, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness has an 80% accuracy in estimating height, so the probability that the witness is correct when they say the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness could also have made a mistake when estimating a shorter attacker as being 185 cm or taller. This would be the probability of a shorter attacker (0.85) multiplied by the witness's error rate in estimating tall (0.2). So, the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is 0.12 + (0.85 * 0.2) = 0.588 or 58.8%.}
