Explanation: Given the demographics of the city, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate for correctly identifying a person's height. However, since the witness could be equally likely to observe a shorter or taller person (as per the conditions of the test), we need to account for the base rate of taller people in the population. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is taller, given that the first witness said so, is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the first witness was wrong, and the second witness was correct. The second witness has a 30% error rate for identifying taller people as shorter. So, the probability that the attacker is taller, but the first witness made a mistake, is 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255.

Adding these probabilities together gives us an estimate of 0.12 + 0.255 â‰ˆ 0.58 for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
