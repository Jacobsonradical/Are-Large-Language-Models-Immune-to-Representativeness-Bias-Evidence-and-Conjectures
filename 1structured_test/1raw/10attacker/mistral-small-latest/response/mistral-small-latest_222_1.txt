{probability: 0.537, explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The first witness correctly identified the height in 80% of cases (let's call this P(correct|taller)). The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller given that he is taller is therefore 0.8. The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is taller given that he is actually shorter is the probability of the witness making an error, which is 0.2 (let's call this P(claim_taller|shorter)).

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is taller given that the witness claimed he is taller is P(taller|claim_taller) = P(claim_taller|taller) * P(taller) / P(claim_taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.537.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.537.}
