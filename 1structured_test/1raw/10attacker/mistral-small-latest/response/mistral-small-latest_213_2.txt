{probability: 0.64,

Explanation:

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given the first witness's claim.

Let T be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and F be the event that the attacker is shorter. Let W1 be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker is taller, and W2 be the event that the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter.

P(T) = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
P(F) = 0.85

The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when it is actually taller is P(W1|T) = 0.8
The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height when it is actually shorter is P(W1|F) = 0.2

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is taller given the witness's claim:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) * P(T) / (P(W1|T) * P(T) + P(W1|F) * P(F))
= 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
â‰ˆ 0.64

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.64.
