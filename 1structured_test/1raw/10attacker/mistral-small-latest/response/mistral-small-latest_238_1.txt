{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that he is 185 cm or taller is 0.8. So, the probability is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. The likelihood of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given that he is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. So, the probability of the first witness identifying the attacker as taller when he is actually shorter is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.56.}
