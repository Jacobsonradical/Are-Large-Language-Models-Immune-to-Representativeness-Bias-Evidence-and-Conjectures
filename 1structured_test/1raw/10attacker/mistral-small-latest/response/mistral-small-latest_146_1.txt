{probability: 0.52}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the attacker's height could be either shorter than 185 cm (with a probability of 0.85, given the city's population distribution) or 185 cm or taller (with a probability of 0.15).
2. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the attacker's height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, so the probability of the witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed that height is 0.80.
3. If the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, there's a 20% chance that the first witness will incorrectly claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17.
4. Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed so: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claimed so) = P(witness claimed so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness claimed so)
5. P(witness claimed so) = P(witness claimed so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness claimed so | attacker is shorter) * P(attacker is shorter) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85 = 0.203
6. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.80 * 0.15 / 0.203 = 0.52.
