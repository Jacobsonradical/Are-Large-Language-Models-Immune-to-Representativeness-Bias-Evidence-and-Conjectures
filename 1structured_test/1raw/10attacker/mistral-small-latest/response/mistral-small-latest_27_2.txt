{probability: 0.538, explanation: Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the witness is correct is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Given that the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, and that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the second witness is incorrect is 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255. Adding these two probabilities gives the total probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.538.}
