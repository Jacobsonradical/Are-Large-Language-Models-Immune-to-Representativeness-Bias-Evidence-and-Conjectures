{probability: 0.56, explanation: Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. First, we calculate the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the population statistics: P(A) = 0.15. Then we calculate the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given the height of the attacker: P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the witness's accuracy) and P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the witness's error rate for shorter people). Then we can calculate the posterior probability: P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]. Plugging in the values, we get approximately 0.56.}
