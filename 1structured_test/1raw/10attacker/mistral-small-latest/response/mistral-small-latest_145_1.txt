{probability: 0.67, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Assuming the witnesses' abilities to judge height are independent and the population statistics given in the problem are accurate, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim can be calculated as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.3)) = 0.67}
