{probability: 0.59, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the distribution of heights in the city. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. Given that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we might initially expect a lower probability. However, the witness's accuracy increases this estimate. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.59.}
