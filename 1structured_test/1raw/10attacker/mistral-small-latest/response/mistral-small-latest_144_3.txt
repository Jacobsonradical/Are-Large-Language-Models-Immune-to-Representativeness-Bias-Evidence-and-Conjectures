{probability: 0.52, based on the information provided and assuming the witnesses are independent, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is taller (0.15) by the probability that the first witness was correct (0.8), and adding this to the probability that the attacker is shorter but the first witness was incorrect (0.85 * 0.2).}
