{probability: 0.52, Given the information provided, the first witness is more reliable than the second. However, considering the distribution of heights in the city, we should also take into account the base rate. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony. The result is approximately 0.52 or 52%.}
