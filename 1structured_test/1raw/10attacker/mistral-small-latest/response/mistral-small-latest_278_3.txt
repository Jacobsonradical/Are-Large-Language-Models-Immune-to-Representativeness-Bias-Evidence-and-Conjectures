{probability: 0.67, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be estimated using Bayes' theorem. Given the population distribution (85% shorter than 185 cm, 15% 185 cm or taller), and the witness's accuracy (80% correct for taller claims), the estimated probability is approximately 0.67 or 67%.}
