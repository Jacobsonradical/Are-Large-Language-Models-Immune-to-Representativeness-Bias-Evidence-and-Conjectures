{probability: 0.528,

To calculate this, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

E: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(E): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the given information.
P(W1|E): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to the given information.
P(W1|~E): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (since the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time).
P(~E): The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 according to the given information.

We want to find P(E|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. By Bayes' theorem:

P(E|W1) = [P(W1|E) * P(E)] / [P(W1|E) * P(E) + P(W1|~E) * P(~E)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(E|W1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.528

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.528.
