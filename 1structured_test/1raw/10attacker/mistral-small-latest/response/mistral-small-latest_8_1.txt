{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we can start with a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate, so we multiply the initial probability by this accuracy: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the first witness was correct despite the attacker actually being shorter. Given that 85% of the population is shorter, and the second witness has a 30% error rate, there is a 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255 probability that the second witness was incorrect in claiming the attacker was shorter. Therefore, the total probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.12 (first witness correct) + 0.255 (second witness wrong) = 0.64.}
