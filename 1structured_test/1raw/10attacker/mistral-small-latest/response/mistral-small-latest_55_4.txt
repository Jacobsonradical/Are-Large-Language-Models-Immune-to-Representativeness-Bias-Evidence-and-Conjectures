{probability: 0.56, This estimate is based on a Bayesian probability calculation. We consider the base rate of 15% of the population being 185 cm or taller, the first witness's accuracy of 80% when the person is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness's error rate of 30% when the person is shorter than 185 cm. The calculation is as follows: (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.3)) = 0.56.}
