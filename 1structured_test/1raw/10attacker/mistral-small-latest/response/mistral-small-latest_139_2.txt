{probability: 0.52, given the information provided}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that the first witness is correct about the height in 80% of cases and wrong in 20% of cases.
2. However, we also know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
3. To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust the witness's accuracy based on the general population distribution.
4. If we assume that the witness's accuracy is independent of the population distribution, we can calculate the probability as follows:
   - The probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (80%).
   - The probability of the witness being wrong when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (20%).
   - Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the estimated probability of the witness being correct in this case is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12.
   - Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the estimated probability of the witness being wrong in this case is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
   - Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) â‰ˆ 0.52.
