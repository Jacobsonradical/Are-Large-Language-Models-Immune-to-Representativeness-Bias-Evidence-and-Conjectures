Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(A): The prior probability of A, which is 0.15 (from b)
P(B|A): The probability of B given A, which is 0.8 (from a)
P(B|not A): The probability of B given not A, which is the error rate of the first witness for those shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17 (from a and b)

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85] = 0.44

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.44.

Final answer: {probability: 0.44}
