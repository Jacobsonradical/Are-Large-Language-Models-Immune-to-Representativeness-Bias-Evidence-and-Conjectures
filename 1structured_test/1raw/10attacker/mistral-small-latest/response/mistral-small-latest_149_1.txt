{probability: 0.64, The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.64. This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is tall (0.15, given by information a) by the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as tall (0.80, given by information b). So, 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.64 or 64%.}
