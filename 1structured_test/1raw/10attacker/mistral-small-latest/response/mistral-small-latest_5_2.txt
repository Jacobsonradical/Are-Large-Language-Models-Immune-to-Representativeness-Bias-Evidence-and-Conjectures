{probability: 0.62, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The probability that the first witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (their accuracy rate). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.62.}
