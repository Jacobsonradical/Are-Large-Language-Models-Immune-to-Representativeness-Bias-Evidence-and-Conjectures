{probability: 0.55, This is calculated by taking into account the accuracy of the witnesses and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the first witness is 80% accurate and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 0.8 * 0.85 = 0.7 probability that the first witness would be correct if the attacker was shorter. This means there is a 0.3 probability that the first witness would incorrectly claim the attacker is taller. However, the second witness, who is 70% accurate, would only make this mistake 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 of the time. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually taller is (1 - 0.7) / (1 - 0.7 - 0.09) = 0.55.}
