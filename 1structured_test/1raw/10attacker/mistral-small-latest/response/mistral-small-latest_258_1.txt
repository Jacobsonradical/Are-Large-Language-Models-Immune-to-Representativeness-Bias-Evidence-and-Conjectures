Explanation:
The first witness is correct in identifying the height 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time. Given that the attacker's height could be either shorter or taller than 185 cm with equal probability (0.5 each), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim can be calculated as follows:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = P(witness is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller)

P(witness is correct | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 (given information)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (given information)

To find P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller), we consider both possibilities:
1) P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
2) P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (since the witness makes an error 20% of the time)

Using total probability law:
P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) = P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

P(witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22 + 0.17 = 0.39

Now, we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.39 â‰ˆ 0.58
