{probability: 0.56, This is calculated by multiplying the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height (0.8). So, 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. Then we add this to the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85) multiplied by the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified the attacker's height as taller than 185 cm (0.2). So, 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.56.}
