{probability: 0.528, The estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem, considering the witnesses' accuracy rates and the general population's height distribution. Given the witnesses' accuracy rates and the population distribution, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.528.}
