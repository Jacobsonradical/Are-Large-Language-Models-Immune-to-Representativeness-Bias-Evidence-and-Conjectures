{probability: 0.58, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%). The likelihood of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 (20%). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.58.}
