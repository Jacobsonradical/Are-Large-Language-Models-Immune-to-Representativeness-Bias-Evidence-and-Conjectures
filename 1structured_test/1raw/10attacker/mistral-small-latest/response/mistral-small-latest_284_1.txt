{probability: 0.55,

Explanation:

Let's break down the information and calculate the probabilities:

1. According to the city's population statistics, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

2. The first witness correctly identified the height in 80% of cases under similar conditions. So, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, there is an 80% chance that the witness will correctly claim this.

3. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller AND the first witness correctly claimed this is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.

4. However, the second witness could also have correctly identified the height if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm. Given that the attacker has a 0.85 probability of being shorter, and the second witness has a 0.7 probability of correctly identifying this, the probability of both events happening is 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.595.

5. Since these are the only two possibilities (either the first witness was correct, or the second witness was correct), we can add these probabilities to get the total probability that the first witness was correct: 0.12 + 0.595 = 0.715.

6. However, we need to account for the fact that the second witness could have incorrectly claimed that the attacker was shorter, even if he was 185 cm or taller. Given a 30% error rate for the second witness, the probability that he incorrectly claimed the attacker was shorter is 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045.

7. Subtracting this from our total probability gives us the final estimate: 0.715 - 0.045 = 0.55.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.55.
