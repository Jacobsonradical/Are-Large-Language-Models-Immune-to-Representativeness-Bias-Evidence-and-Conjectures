{probability: 0.55, The estimate is derived by considering the base rate of the population and the accuracy of the witness. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who is correct 80% of the time, increases this probability to 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm but the first witness was wrong. This happens 20% of the time, so the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified a shorter person as taller is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. However, since the second witness contradicts the first witness, we need to adjust for this. The second witness, who is wrong 30% of the time, would have incorrectly identified a tall person as short with a probability of 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045. Subtracting this from our previous estimate gives us a final estimate of 0.29 - 0.045 = 0.55.}
