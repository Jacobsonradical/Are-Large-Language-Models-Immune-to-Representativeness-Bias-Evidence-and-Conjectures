{probability: 0.625}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, and incorrect 20% of the time, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the witness said so, is 0.8.
2. However, we also know that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability: P(taller|witness) = P(witness|taller) * P(taller) / P(witness)
4. P(witness) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness being correct given that the attacker is taller, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being taller, and the probability of the witness being incorrect given that the attacker is shorter, multiplied by the probability of the attacker being shorter.
5. So, P(witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.26
6. Therefore, P(taller|witness) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.26 â‰ˆ 0.625

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.625.
