{probability: 0.54, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The base rate of people being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The first witness has a true positive rate of 0.8, and a false positive rate of 0.2. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is calculated as (0.15*0.8) / (0.15*0.8 + 0.85*0.2) = 0.54}
