{probability: 0.55, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (from information b). The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from information a). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.55}
