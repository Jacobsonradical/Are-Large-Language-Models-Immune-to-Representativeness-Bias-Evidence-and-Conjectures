{probability: 0.54, Given the information provided, the first witness is more reliable than the second witness, with an accuracy of 80%. However, considering that the majority of the population (85%) is shorter than 185 cm, it's still more likely that the attacker was shorter. To calculate a probability, we can use Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.54.}
