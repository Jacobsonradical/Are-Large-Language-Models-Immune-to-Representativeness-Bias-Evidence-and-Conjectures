{probability: 0.648, explanation: The attacker's height is more likely to be 185 cm or taller if the first witness, who has a higher accuracy, claims so. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 0.15 probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, the first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying someone of this height. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.648.}
