{probability: 0.56, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the information, the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80% accurate). So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.56 or 56%.}
