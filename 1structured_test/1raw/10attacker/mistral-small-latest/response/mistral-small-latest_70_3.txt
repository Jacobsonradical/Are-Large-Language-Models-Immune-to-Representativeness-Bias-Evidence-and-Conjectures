{probability: 0.571, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height, correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. To estimate the posterior probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(Attacker is 185+|Witness1 says 185+) = [P(Witness1 says 185+|Attacker is 185+) * P(Attacker is 185+)] / P(Witness1 says 185+). P(Witness1 says 185+) = P(Witness1 says 185+|Attacker is 185+) * P(Attacker is 185+) + P(Witness1 says 185+|Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter). Plugging in the given probabilities, we get P(Attacker is 185+|Witness1 says 185+) â‰ˆ 0.571.}
