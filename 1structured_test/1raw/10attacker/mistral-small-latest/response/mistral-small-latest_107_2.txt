{probability: 0.56, based on the available information and assuming the witnesses are independent}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that each witness is correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. For the first witness, the probability of correctly identifying the attacker's height is 0.8 (80%), and the probability of making an error is 0.2 (20%). Since the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, the probability of the first witness being correct is 0.8.
3. For the second witness, the probability of making an error when the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.3 (30%), so the probability of the second witness being correct is 0.7 (70%).
4. Assuming the witnesses are independent, we can find the probability that both are correct by multiplying their individual probabilities: 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56.
5. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.56.
