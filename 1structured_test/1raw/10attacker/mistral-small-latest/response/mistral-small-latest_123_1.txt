{probability: 0.652, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of 15% for people 185 cm or taller in the city, and the first witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying heights under similar conditions, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.652.}
