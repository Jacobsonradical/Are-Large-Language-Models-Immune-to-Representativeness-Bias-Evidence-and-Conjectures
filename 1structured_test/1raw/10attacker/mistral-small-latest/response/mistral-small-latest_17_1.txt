{probability: 0.57,

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the attacker's height is a random variable from the population distribution in the city (85% shorter than 185 cm and 15% 185 cm or taller).
2. The first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height with a probability of 80% if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and 20% if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. Given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
4. Let P(A) be the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15), and P(E) be the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
5. P(E|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.8).
6. P(E|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.2).
7. Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]
8. Plugging in the values: P(A|E) ≈ (0.8 * 0.15) / [(0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)] ≈ 0.57

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.57.
