{probability: 0.58, This estimation is based on the Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter is 0.85 and the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate, identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.58.}
