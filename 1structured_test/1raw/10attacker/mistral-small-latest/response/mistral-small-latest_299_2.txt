{probability: 0.64, This estimate is based on the Bayes' theorem, taking into account the prior probability of the attacker's height (0.15), and the reliability of the first witness (0.8). The calculation is as follows: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 claims so) = [P(witness 1 claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness 1 claims so) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.64}
