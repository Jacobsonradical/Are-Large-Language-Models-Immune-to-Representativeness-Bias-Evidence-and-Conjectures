{probability: 0.64, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of 15% of the population being 185 cm or taller, the first witness's 80% accuracy in identifying taller individuals, and the second witness's 30% error rate in identifying shorter individuals, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.64.}
