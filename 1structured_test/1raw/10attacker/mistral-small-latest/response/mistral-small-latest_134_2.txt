{probability: 0.576, This estimate is based on Bayes' theorem and the given probabilities. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15% of the population). The likelihood that the first witness would correctly identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that he is indeed that tall is 0.8 (80% accuracy). Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is approximately 0.576 (0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2)).}
