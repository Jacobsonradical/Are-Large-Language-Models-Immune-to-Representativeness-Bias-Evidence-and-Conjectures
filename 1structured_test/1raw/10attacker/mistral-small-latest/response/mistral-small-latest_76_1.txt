{probability: 0.568,

Explanation: This is a Bayes' theorem problem. Let's denote A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 as the events that the first and second witnesses respectively claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / P(B1).

From the given information, P(A) = 0.15.

P(B1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (since the first witness is correct 80% of the time).

P(B1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A). P(not A) = 0.85, and P(B1|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter, which is 0.2 (since the first witness makes an error in 20% of the cases).

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem gives P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.568.}
