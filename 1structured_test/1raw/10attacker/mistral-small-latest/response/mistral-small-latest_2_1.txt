{probability: 0.62, The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller can be calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that the first witness is correct in 80% of cases, and the base rate of people taller than 185 cm is 15%, the probability that the attacker was taller than 185 cm, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.62.}
