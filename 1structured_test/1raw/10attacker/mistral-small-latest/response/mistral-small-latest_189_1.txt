{probability: 0.54, This estimate is calculated by considering the accuracy of the first witness and the distribution of heights in the city's population. The witness, who is 80% accurate, correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. However, given that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, we need to adjust for the base rate. The final probability is calculated as (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.54}
