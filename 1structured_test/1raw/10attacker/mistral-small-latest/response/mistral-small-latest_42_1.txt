{probability: 0.556, based on the information given, the first witness is more reliable with an 80% accuracy rate. If we assume that the population distribution of heights is the same as in the sample the witnesses were tested on (50% shorter than 185 cm and 50% 185 cm or taller), then the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so is 0.8 * 0.5 / (0.8 * 0.5 + 0.2 * 0.5) = 0.556}
