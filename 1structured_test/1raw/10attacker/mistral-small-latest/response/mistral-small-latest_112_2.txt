{probability: 0.55,

Explanation:

Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

Let's denote:
A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(A): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Given the information, P(A) = 0.15.
P(B|A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually that tall. This is given as 0.8.
P(B|not A): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is not that tall. This can be calculated as the product of the probability that the attacker is shorter (0.85) and the probability that the witness makes an error (0.2), which equals 0.17.

Using Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A))

Plugging in the values: P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.17 * 0.85) = 0.55

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.55.
