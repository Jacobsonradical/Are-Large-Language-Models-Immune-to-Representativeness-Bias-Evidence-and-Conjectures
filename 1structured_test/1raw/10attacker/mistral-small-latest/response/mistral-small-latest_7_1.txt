{probability: 0.59, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability (from b) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (from a). The likelihood of the witness's statement given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 (from a). So, the posterior probability is (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)) = 0.59.}
