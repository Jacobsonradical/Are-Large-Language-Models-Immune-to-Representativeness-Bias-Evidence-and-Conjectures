{probability: 0.58, given the information provided, the estimate is calculated as follows:

The first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time. However, in this case, the witness made a claim that contradicts the second witness and the general population statistics. But since we don't have any reason to believe the first witness is more likely to be correct when contradicting others, we can assume the first witness's accuracy remains the same.

Given that the population distribution is 85:15 for people shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller, and the second witness (who also claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is correct 70% of the time, there's a 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.665 probability that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 1 - 0.665 = 0.58 (or 58%).}
