{probability: 0.54}

Here's how I calculated it:

1. The first witness is correct in 80% of cases and incorrect in 20% of cases.
2. Given that half of the people are 185 cm or taller, the first witness would identify them as such 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is 0.8.
3. However, we also need to consider the base rate of the population, which is that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.54
