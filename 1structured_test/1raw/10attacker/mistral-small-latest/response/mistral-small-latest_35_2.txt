{probability: 0.64,

Here's the reasoning:

1. We know that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, so the probability that the attacker is shorter is 0.85.
2. Conversely, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
3. The first witness has an accuracy of 80% in identifying the correct height.
4. So, if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness will correctly claim this is 0.8.
5. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness correctly identified this is 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12.
6. However, the witness could also have claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller even if they were not. The probability of this happening is the error rate (20%) times the probability that the attacker is shorter (0.85). So, 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17.
7. Therefore, the total probability that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of whether they were or not, is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29.
8. But we want the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this. This is a conditional probability and can be calculated as follows: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claimed so) = P(witness claimed so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(witness claimed so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.64.
