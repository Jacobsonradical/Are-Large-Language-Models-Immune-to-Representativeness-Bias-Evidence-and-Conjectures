{probability: 0.58, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the information that the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller, and the prevalence of people 185 cm or taller in the population is 15%, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim is approximately 0.58.}
