{probability: 0.56, explanation: Given the information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know P(A) = 0.15 from the population statistics. The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, so P(B|A) = 0.8. The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2, so P(B|not A) = 0.2. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A) * P(B|A) / [P(A) * P(B|A) + P(not A) * P(B|not A)] = 0.15 * 0.8 / [0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2] = 0.56.}
