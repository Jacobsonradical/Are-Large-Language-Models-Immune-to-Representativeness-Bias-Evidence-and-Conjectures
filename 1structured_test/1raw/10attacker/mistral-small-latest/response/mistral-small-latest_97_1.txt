{probability: 0.54, This estimation is based on the Bayes' theorem, considering the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), and the likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height given that he is indeed 185 cm or taller (0.8), and the likelihood of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height given that he is actually shorter than 185 cm (0.2).}
