{probability: 0.62, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate in judging height, identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We can calculate the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller: 0.8 (accuracy) * 0.15 (base probability) = 0.12. Now, we need to account for the possibility that the second witness, who has a 70% accuracy rate, incorrectly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this happening given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller is: 0.3 (error rate) * 0.15 (base probability) = 0.045. To find the overall probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we add these probabilities: 0.12 (first witness correct) + 0.045 (second witness incorrect) = 0.62.}
