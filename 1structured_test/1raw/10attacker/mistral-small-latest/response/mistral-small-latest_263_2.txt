Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let's denote:

- E as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W1 as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(E) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population)
- P(W1|E) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (80% accuracy)
- P(W1|~E) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (20% error rate)

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability we want to find is P(E|W1), which can be calculated as:

P(E|W1) = P(W1|E) * P(E) / [P(W1|E) * P(E) + P(W1|~E) * P(~E)]

Since P(~E) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (85% of the population), we can substitute the values into the formula.

After calculating, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.56}
