Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B), where:
- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (since the first witness is correct about the height 80% of the time)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (since the first witness makes an error 20% of the time)

We need to find P(not A), which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Given that P(A) = 0.15, then P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

Now we can find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.49 or 49%.

Answer: {probability: 0.49}
