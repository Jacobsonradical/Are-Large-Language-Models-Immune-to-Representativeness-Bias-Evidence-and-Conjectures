{probability: 0.58, given the first witness's accuracy and the population distribution}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's assume that the first witness's accuracy is independent of the actual height distribution in the population.
2. Since the first witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of cases, there's an 80% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the witness said so.
3. However, we also know that only 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness's observation is independent of the population distribution, we can adjust our estimate using Bayes' theorem: P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) = [P(witness claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness claims so)
4. P(witness claims so) = P(witness claims so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(witness claims so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
5. P(witness claims so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is the error rate of the first witness, which is 20%. So, P(witness claims so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20 * 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
6. Substituting the values, we get P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness claims so) ≈ 0.80 * 0.15 / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85) ≈ 0.58

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.58.
