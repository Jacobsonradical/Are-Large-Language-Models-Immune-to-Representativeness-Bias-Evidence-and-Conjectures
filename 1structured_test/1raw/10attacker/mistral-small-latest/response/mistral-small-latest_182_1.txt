{probability: 0.68, This estimate is calculated by considering the base rate of the population (0.15 for people 185 cm or taller), and the reliability of the first witness (0.80). Multiplying these two values together gives us the estimated probability of 0.15*0.80 = 0.12, or 12%. However, we also need to take into account the possibility that the first witness was correct even though the attacker was actually shorter. This can happen when the second witness, who has a 30% error rate, misidentified the attacker's height. Therefore, we need to add the probability of the first witness being correct while the attacker is shorter. This is calculated as the base rate of shorter people (0.85) times the second witness's error rate (0.30), which equals 0.255 or 25.5%. So, the total estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 12% + 25.5% = 0.68 or 68%.}
