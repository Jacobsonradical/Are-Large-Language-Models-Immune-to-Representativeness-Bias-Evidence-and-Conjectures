{probability: 0.57, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

Explanation:

We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and E be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (from the given data in b)
P(E|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(E|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness makes an error when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
P(not A) = 0.85 (from the given data in b)

We need to find P(A|E), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|E) = [P(E|A) * P(A)] / [P(E|A) * P(A) + P(E|not A) * P(not A)]
       ≈ [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]
       ≈ 0.57

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.57.
