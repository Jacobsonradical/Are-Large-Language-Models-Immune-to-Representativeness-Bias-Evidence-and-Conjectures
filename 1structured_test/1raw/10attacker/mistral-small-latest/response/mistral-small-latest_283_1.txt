{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that the first witness has an accuracy of 80%, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim. If we assume that the attacker's height follows the city's population distribution, there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, since the witness correctly identifies this height 80% of the time, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given the witness's claim is 0.15 / (1 - 0.20) = 0.58 or 58%.}
