{probability: 0.52, The estimate is made by considering the accuracy of the witnesses and the distribution of heights in the city. Given that the first witness is more accurate (80% vs 70%), their testimony carries more weight. However, the majority of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm (85%), which also influences the estimate. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.52.}
