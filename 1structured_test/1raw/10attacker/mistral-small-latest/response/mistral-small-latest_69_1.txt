{probability: 0.49, given the information, the first witness has an 80% accuracy rate when identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, but 85% of the population is actually shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, although the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, it's still more likely than not that the attacker was shorter. The exact probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem, which gives a probability of approximately 0.49.}
