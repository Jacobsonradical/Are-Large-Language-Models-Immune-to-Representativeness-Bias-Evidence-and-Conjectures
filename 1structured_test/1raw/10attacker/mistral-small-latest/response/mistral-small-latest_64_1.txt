{probability: 0.56,

Explanation: This is a probability question that requires the use of Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 be the events that the first and second witness, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) / P(B1)

From the information, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

P(B1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8.

P(B1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A).

P(B1|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is given as the error rate of the first witness, which is 0.2. So, P(B1|not A) = 0.2. P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values into the equation, we get: P(A|B1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) â‰ˆ 0.56}
