{probability: 0.62, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would correctly identify a person of that height is 0.8, and the likelihood that they would incorrectly identify a person of shorter height is 0.2 (since they make mistakes 20% of the time). Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.62.}
