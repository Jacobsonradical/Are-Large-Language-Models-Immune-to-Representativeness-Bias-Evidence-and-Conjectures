{probability: 0.54,

Here's the reasoning:
The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, given the demographics of the city.

The first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so the likelihood that they are correct given the attacker's height is 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 says so) = [P(witness 1 says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(witness 1 says so)

P(witness 1 says so) = [P(witness 1 says so | attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(attacker is 185 cm or taller)] + [P(witness 1 says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

P(witness 1 says so | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate)
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (given)

So, P(witness 1 says so) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Therefore, P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | witness 1 says so) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.54

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.54.}
