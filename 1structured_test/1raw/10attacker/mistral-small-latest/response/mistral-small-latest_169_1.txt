Based on the given information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller using Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- E: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- T1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- P(E): the prior probability of E, which is 0.15 (as per information b)
- P(T1|E): the probability that the first witness claims E given that E is true, which is 0.8 (as per information a)
- P(T1|~E): the probability that the first witness claims E given that E is not true, which is 0.2 (as per information a)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(E|T1) = [P(T1|E) * P(E)] / [P(T1|E) * P(E) + P(T1|~E) * P(~E)]

Plugging in the values:
P(E|T1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85] = 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.36.
