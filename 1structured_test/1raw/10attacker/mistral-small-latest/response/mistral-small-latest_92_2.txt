{probability: 0.545, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the base rate of the population (0.15 for people 185 cm or taller), and the reliability of the first witness (0.80 for correctly identifying tall people), the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's claim, is approximately 0.545.}
