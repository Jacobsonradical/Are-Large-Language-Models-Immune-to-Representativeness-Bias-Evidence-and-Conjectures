Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 and W2 be the events that the first and second witness, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem, we know:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)]

Since P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85, and P(W1|not A) = 0.2, we can substitute these values into the equation:

P(A|W1) = [0.8 * 0.15] / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85]

After calculating, we get:

probability: 0.3684

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3684 or 36.84%.
