{probability: 0.64, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we start with a base probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate, correctly identified the attacker's height. So, we multiply the base probability by the witness's accuracy: 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm but the witness made an error. This would be the probability of the attacker being shorter (0.85) times the witness's error rate (0.2): 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we have a second witness who claimed the opposite. This witness has a 30% error rate. So, the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller but the second witness made an error is 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045. Adding this to our previous estimate gives us a final probability of 0.29 + 0.045 = 0.64.}
