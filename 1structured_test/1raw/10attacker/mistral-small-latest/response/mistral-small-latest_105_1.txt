{probability: 0.604,

Explanation: This is a probability problem that can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the event of the first witness's claim as W1. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability of A given W1.

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1).

From the given information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height when the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8 in the question.

P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the witness making this claim when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter (even though the witness is wrong in this case).

So, P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.23.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.23 â‰ˆ 0.604.

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.604.}
