{probability: 0.61, explanation: The base rate of people being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%. Given the first witness's accuracy of 80% in identifying the correct height, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the attacker was shorter but the witness made an error. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and the witness has a 20% error rate, the probability of this happening is: 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us a final estimate of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.61, or 61%.}
