{probability: 0.63, This estimate is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability, given the city's population, is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8. The likelihood of the first witness's claim given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. Therefore, the posterior probability is (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.63.}
