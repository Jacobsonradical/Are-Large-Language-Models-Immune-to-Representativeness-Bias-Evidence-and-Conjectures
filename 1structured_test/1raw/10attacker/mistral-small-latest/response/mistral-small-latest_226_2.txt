{probability: 0.54, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness correctly identified the height 80% of the time, so we multiply 0.15 by 0.8 to get 0.12. However, the first witness could also have correctly identified the height of a taller attacker even if the attacker was actually in the shorter group (a false positive). Since the first witness makes errors 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter, and 45% of the population is in this group, the probability of a false positive is 0.45 * 0.2 = 0.09. Adding the probabilities of the attacker being taller and a false positive, we get 0.12 + 0.09 = 0.54. Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.54.}
