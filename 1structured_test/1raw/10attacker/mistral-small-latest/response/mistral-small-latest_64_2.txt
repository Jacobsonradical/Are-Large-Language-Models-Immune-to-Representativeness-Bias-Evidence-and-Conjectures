{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (15%). The likelihood of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%). Therefore, the posterior probability is calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.56}
