Based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

From the information, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller). The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8. The witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller 20% of the time, so P(B|not A) = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 (since half the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

So, P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.1 * 0.85] = 0.56

Therefore, the estimate is {probability: 0.56}
