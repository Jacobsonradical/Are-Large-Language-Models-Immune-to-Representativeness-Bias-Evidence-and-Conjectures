{probability: 0.72, based on the information provided, the first witness is more reliable with an 80% accuracy rate. Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies this height 80% of the time, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.72 (0.15 * 0.80)}
