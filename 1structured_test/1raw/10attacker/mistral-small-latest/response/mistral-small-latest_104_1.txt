{probability: 0.86, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, we have a prior probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The first witness is correct in identifying the height about 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed so, is calculated as follows: P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 claims so) = P(Witness 1 is correct | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. However, we also need to account for the probability that the witness is incorrect when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is calculated as P(Witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter) * P(Attacker is shorter) = 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.17. The total probability of the witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is the sum of these two probabilities, which is 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is 0.12 / 0.29, which is approximately 0.86.}
