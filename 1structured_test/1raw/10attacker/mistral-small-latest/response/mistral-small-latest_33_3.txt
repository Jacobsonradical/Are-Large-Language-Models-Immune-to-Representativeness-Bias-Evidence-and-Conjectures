{probability: 0.54,

Explanation: This is a problem of conditional probability. Given that the first witness is correct about the attacker's height, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- A: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are looking for P(A|B), the probability of A given B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

From the information given:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(B), we need to consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

So, P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.28

Finally, P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.28 â‰ˆ 0.54}
