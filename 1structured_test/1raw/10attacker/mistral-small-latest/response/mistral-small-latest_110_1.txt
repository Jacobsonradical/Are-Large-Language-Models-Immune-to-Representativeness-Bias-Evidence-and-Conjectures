{probability: 0.64,

Here's the reasoning:

1. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15%, given the population distribution in the city (information a).
2. The first witness correctly identifies the height in 80% of cases.
3. So, the probability that the witness is correct, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so:
   Posterior probability = (Likelihood * Prior probability) / (Likelihood * Prior probability + (1 - Likelihood) * (1 - Prior probability))
   = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
   = 0.64

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.64.}
