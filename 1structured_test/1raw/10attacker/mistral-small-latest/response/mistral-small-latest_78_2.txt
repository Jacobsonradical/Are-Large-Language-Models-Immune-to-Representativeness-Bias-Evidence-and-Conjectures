{probability: 0.533, explanation: Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.533. This is calculated by multiplying the probability of the witness being correct (0.80), given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15, according to the population distribution), by the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (0.15), and then dividing by the sum of two products: (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85).}
