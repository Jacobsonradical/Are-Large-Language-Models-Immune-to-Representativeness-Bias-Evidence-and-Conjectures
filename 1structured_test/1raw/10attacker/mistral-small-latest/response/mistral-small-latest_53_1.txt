{probability: 0.51, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15, and the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person's height if they are indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8, the posterior probability can be calculated as (0.15 * 0.8) / ((0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)) = 0.51.}
