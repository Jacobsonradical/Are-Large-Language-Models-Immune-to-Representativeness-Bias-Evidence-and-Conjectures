{probability: 0.59, based on the information provided and assuming the witnesses are independent and have no reason to lie}

Here's the reasoning:

1. Let's first find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the city's population statistics. That probability is 0.15.
2. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time. So, if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, there's an 80% chance the witness will correctly claim so. Therefore, the probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that he is, is 0.80 * 0.15 = 0.12.
3. The second witness, who claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, has a 30% error rate when the person is actually 185 cm or taller. So, the probability of the second witness making an error given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.30 * 0.15 = 0.045.
4. If both witnesses are independent, we can multiply the probabilities of their observations given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: 0.12 * (1 - 0.045) = 0.1134.
5. However, we also need to consider the probability that both witnesses make an error given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. The probability of the first witness making an error is 0.20 * 0.85 = 0.17, and the probability of the second witness being correct is 0.70 * 0.85 = 0.595. The probability of both errors happening is 0.17 * 0.595 = 0.10165.
6. The total probability of both witnesses making the observations they did, given the attacker's height, is the sum of the probabilities for the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the probabilities for the attacker being shorter: 0.1134 + 0.10165 = 0.21505.
7. Finally, to estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we divide the probability of both witnesses' statements given the attacker's height by the total probability of their statements: 0.1134 / 0.21505 â‰ˆ 0.59.
