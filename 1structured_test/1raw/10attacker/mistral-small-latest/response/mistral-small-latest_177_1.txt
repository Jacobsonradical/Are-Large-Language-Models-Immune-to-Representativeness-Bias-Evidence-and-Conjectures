Based on the given information, we can estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as follows:

The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate in identifying people's height, and the attacker's height is claimed to be 185 cm or taller. However, we also know that only 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller (from information b).

Given that the witness is correct, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 100% (since the witness claimed so). However, the witness is only correct 80% of the time. So, we multiply the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15) by the witness's accuracy rate (0.8).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.

So, the answer is: {probability: 0.12}
