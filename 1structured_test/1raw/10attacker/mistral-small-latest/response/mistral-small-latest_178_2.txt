{probability: 0.56, Given the information, the base rate of people taller than 185 cm is 0.15. The first witness has an accuracy of 0.8 in identifying the correct height. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm, given that the first witness said so, is 0.8 * 0.15 / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.56.}
