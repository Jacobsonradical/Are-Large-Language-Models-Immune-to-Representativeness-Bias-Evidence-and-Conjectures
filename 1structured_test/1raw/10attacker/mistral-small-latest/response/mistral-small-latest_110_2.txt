{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by first finding the probability of each witness being correct given their accuracy rates (80% for the first witness and 70% for the second witness). The probability that the first witness is correct and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. The probability that the second witness is incorrect and the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045. Adding these probabilities together gives an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.64 that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.}
