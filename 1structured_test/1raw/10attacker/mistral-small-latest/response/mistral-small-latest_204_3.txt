{probability: 0.58, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability that the attacker is shorter is 0.85. The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the height, so there is an 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 probability that the attacker is actually shorter but the witness incorrectly identified him as taller. The second witness has a 30% chance of making a mistake, so there is a 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045 probability that the attacker is actually taller but the second witness incorrectly identified him as shorter. Since these are the only two possibilities, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 1 - (0.17 + 0.045) = 0.58.}
