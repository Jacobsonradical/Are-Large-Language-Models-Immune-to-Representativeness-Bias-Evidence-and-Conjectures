{probability: 0.59,

Explanation:
Given the general population distribution, the base rate for a person being 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1)

We know P(A) = 0.15.
P(W1|A) is the first witness's accuracy in identifying people who are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8.

P(W1|not A) is the first witness's error rate in identifying people who are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.
P(not A) = 0.85.

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
      = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.17
      = 0.29

So, P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29
            = 0.59 (rounded to two decimal places)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is 0.59.}
