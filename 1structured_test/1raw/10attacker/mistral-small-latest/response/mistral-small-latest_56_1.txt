{probability: 0.64, This is calculated by considering the base rate of 15% for people being 185 cm or taller in the city, and then adjusting it based on the first witness's reliability. The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time, so the probability becomes 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12. However, the witness also incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, so we need to add this error to our estimate: 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. But since the second witness contradicts this, we need to account for that as well. The second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time, so the estimated probability of the attacker being tall, given the second witness's testimony, is 0.15 * 0.7 = 0.105. Adding this to our previous estimate gives us the final probability: 0.29 + 0.105 = 0.64.}
