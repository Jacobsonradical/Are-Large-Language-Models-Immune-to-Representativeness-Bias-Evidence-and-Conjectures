{probability: 0.55, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution, is 0.15. The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually that tall, is 0.80. The likelihood that the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was not that tall, is 0.20 (the error rate). So the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is (0.15 * 0.8) / [(0.15 * 0.8) + (0.85 * 0.2)] = 0.55.}
