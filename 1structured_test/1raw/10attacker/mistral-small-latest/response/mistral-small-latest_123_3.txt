  "probability": 0.72,
  "explanation": "Given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, this is our initial estimate. However, we need to account for the witness's accuracy. The first witness correctly identifies the correct height 80% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, given that the witness claimed so, is 0.8 * 0.15 = 0.12. But since there's a 20% chance that the witness is wrong, and the attacker might actually be shorter than 185 cm, we also need to consider this scenario. The second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time. So, the probability that the attacker was actually shorter, given that the second witness claimed so, is 0.7 * 0.85 = 0.6. However, since the second witness was also wrong 30% of the time, there's a chance that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 0.3 * 0.15 = 0.045. Adding the probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller according to both witnesses, we get 0.12 + 0.045 = 0.72."
