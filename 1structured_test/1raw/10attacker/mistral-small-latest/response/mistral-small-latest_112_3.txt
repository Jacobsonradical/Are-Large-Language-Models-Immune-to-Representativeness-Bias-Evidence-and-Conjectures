{probability: 0.56, This is based on the probability of the first witness being correct, given their track record. Even though the witness's ability to judge height is not perfect, they have a better success rate than the second witness. Therefore, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as follows: 0.80 (the first witness's accuracy) x 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller) = 0.56 or 56%.}
