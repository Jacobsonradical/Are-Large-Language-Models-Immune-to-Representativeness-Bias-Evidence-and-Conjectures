{probability: 0.544, explanation: This is a Bayesian inference problem. We start with the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%) based on the population statistics (information a). Then we consider the evidence from the two witnesses. The probability that the first witness is correct, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (80%). So, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, can be calculated as follows: 0.15 * 0.8 / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.544. This is an estimate, assuming the witnesses' judgments are independent.}
