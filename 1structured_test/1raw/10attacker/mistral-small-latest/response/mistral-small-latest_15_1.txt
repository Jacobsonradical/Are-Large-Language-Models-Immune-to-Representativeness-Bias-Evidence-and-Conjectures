{probability: 0.64}

This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of the attacker being shorter is 0.85. The first witness correctly identified the height in 80% of cases, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is taller is 0.8. Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is 0.8 * (1 - 0.85) / (0.8 * (1 - 0.85) + 0.2 * 0.85) = 0.64.
