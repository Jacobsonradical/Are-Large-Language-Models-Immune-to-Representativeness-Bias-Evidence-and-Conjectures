{probability: 0.53, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given by information b). The probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker's height, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (given by information a). Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is (0.15 * 0.8) / (0.15 * 0.8 + 0.85 * 0.2) = 0.53.}
