{probability: 0.612, explanation: Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, there is a 15% chance that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. However, we have to consider the witnesses' reliability. The first witness was correct 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller. So, the probability that the first witness is correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is 15% (population distribution) * 80% (witness reliability) = 0.612 or 61.2%.}
