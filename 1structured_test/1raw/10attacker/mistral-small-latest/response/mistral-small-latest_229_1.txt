{probability: 0.56, This is calculated using Bayes' theorem. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The first witness has an accuracy of 80%, so the probability of the witness being correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8. Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so is (0.15*0.8) / ((0.15*0.8) + (0.85*0.2)) = 0.56.}
