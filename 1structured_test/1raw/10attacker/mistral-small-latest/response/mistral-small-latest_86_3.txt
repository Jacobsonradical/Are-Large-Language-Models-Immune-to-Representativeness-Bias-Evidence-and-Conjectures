{probability: 0.56,

Explanation: Given that 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, there's an initial probability of 0.15 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so the probability that the witness is correct given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the witness claims so:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) = P(Witness claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness claims so)

P(Witness claims so) = P(Witness claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness claims so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) * P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given that the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(Witness claims so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

P(Witness claims so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = P(Witness makes a mistake) = 0.2 (since the population is evenly split between those shorter than 185 cm and those who are 185 cm or taller, and the witness makes mistakes 20% of the time).

So, P(Witness claims so) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22 + 0.17 = 0.39.

Therefore, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness claims so) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.39 â‰ˆ 0.56.

Hence, your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.56.
