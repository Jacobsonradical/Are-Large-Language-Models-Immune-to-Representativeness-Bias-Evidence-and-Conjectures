{probability: 0.48, This estimate is calculated by first considering the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15. Then, we consider the accuracy of the first witness in identifying people's height, which is 0.8. Multiplying these two values together gives us an estimated probability of 0.12 that the witness correctly identified a tall person. However, we also need to account for the possibility that the witness might have incorrectly identified a short person as tall. Given that there are more short people in the city (0.85), and the witness makes an incorrect judgment 20% of the time, the probability of this happening is 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17. Adding these two probabilities together gives us an estimated probability of 0.29. However, since the second witness contradicts the first witness, we need to consider the second witness's reliability as well. The second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time, so the probability that they correctly identified the attacker as short is 0.85 * 0.7 = 0.595. The probability that they incorrectly identified a tall person as short is 0.15 * 0.3 = 0.045. Subtracting these probabilities from 1 gives us the estimated probability that the attacker was tall, despite the second witness's claim, which is approximately 0.48.}
