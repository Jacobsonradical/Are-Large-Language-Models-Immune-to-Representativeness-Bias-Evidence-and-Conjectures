  "explanation": "This is a Bayesian probability problem. Let's denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as A. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / P(W1).

From the information given, P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller).

P(W1|A) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.8.

P(W1) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A).

P(W1|not A) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate of the first witness, which is 0.2.

P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of people in the city who are shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1), we get P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.22.

Finally, P(A|W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.22 â‰ˆ 0.566."
