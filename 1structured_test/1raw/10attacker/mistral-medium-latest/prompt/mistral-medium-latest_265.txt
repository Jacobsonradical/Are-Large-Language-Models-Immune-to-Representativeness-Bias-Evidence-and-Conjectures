A person was attacked from behind at night and the victim could not see the attacker's height. Despite this, we have the following two available information:

{
  "a": "85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.",
  "b": "There were two witnesses to the accident. One claimed that the attacker had been 185 cm or taller, and the other claimed that the attacker had been shorter than 185 cm. The court assessed the witness's ability to judge a person's height under conditions similar to that night. Given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller, the first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the timeand erred in 20% of the cases. The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases."
}

What is your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed?

Please answer the question in the following format: {probability: your estimate, please provide a number between 0 and 1}
