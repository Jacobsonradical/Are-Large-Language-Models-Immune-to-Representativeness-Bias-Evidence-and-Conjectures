To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness testified that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W2: The event that the second witness testified that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(H^c) = 0.85 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)
P(W1|H^c) = 0.20 (from b)
P(W2|H) = 0.30 (from b)
P(W2|H^c) = 0.70 (from b)

We want to find P(H|W1, W2^c), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified so, and the second witness did not.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1, W2^c) = P(W1, W2^c|H) \* P(H) / P(W1, W2^c)

We can rewrite the joint probability P(W1, W2^c|H) as P(W1|H) \* P(W2^c|H) since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height. Thus:

P(W1, W2^c|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H^c) = 0.80 \* 0.70 = 0.56

Similarly, we can rewrite the joint probability P(W1, W2^c|H^c) as P(W1|H^c) \* P(W2|H^c) since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height. Thus:

P(W1, W2^c|H^c) = P(W1|H^c) \* P(W2|H^c) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we need to find the marginal probability P(W1, W2^c). We can do this using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2^c) = P(W1, W2^c|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2^c|H^c) \* P(H^c)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(W1, W2^c) = 0.56 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.119 = 0.203

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|W1, W2^c):

P(H|W1, W2^c) = 0.56 \* 0.15 / 0.203 â‰ˆ 0.4236

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4236.
