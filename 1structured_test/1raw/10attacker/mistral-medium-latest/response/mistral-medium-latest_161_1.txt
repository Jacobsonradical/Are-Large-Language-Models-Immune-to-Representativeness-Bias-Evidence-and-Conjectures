To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that Witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(H): The prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(W1|H): The likelihood that Witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
P(W1|¬H): The likelihood that Witness 1 says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker's height is not 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (Since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (Since Witness 1 correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (Since Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is not 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(H|W1) ≈ 0.335

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of Witness 1, is approximately 0.335.
