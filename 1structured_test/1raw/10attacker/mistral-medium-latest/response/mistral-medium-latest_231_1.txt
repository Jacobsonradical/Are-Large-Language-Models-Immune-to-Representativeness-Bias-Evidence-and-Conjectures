To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: the event that witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(W1|H) = 0.8 (from information b, first witness's accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.2 (from information b, first witness's error rate)
P(W2|H) = 0.3 (from information b, second witness's error rate)
P(W2|¬H) = 0.7 (from information b, second witness's accuracy rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the two witnesses give conflicting testimonies, we can use the law of total probability to find the probability of H given both witnesses' testimonies. First, let's find P(W1) and P(W2):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.235
P(W2) = P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W2|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.705

Since the witnesses' testimonies are contradictory, we can assume that only one of them is correct. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of H given W1 and ¬W2 as:

P(H|W1,¬W2) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(H|W1,¬W2) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3846

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.3846}
