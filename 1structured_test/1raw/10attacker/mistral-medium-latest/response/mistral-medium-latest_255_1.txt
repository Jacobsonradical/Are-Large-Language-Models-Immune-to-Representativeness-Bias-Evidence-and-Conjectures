{probability: 0.41, please note that this is an estimate and not a certainty}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness.
2. Bayes' theorem states that the probability of an event (A) occurring given that another event (B) has occurred is: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)
3. In this case, event A is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B is the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
4. From the information given, P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying the height, which is 80% or 0.8.
5. We also know from point b that the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population is 15% or 0.15, so P(A) = 0.15.
6. The probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height, is the sum of two probabilities: the probability of the witness being correct when the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
7. The probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 20% or 0.2, since the witness errs in 20% of cases. Given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness being incorrect when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.
8. Therefore, the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is P(B) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 = 0.205.
9. Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness: P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.205 = 0.41.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
