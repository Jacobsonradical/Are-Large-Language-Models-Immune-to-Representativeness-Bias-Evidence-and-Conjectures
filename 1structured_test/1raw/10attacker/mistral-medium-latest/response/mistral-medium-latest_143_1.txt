To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W: the first witness's claim that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

P(H): prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (information a)

P(W|H): likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (information b)

P(not H): prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller = 0.85 (information a)

P(W|not H): likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (information b)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(H|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]

P(H|W) = 0.12 / 0.29

probability: 0.4138 (rounded to four decimal places)
