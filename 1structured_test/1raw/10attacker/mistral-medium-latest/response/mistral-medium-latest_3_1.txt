To answer this question, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the base rate of people's heights in the city.

First, let's calculate the probability that the first witness is correct, given that they have an 80% accuracy rate when identifying someone as 185 cm or taller. This is simply 0.8.

Next, let's consider the second witness's testimony. They have a 70% accuracy rate when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, but this doesn't directly help us determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Instead, we can calculate the probability that they are incorrect when identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

Now, let's consider the base rate of people's heights in the city. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so this is our prior probability.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can update this prior probability based on the witness testimonies. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where H is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, E is the evidence from the witness testimonies, and P(H) and P(not H) are the prior probabilities of the hypothesis and its negation, respectively.

In this case, we have:

P(E|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24 (the probability that both witnesses would give their testimonies if the attacker was 185 cm or taller)
P(E|not H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14 (the probability that both witnesses would give their testimonies if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)
P(H) = 0.15
P(not H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.036 / [0.036 + 0.119]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.226

Therefore, our estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the base rate of people's heights in the city, is approximately 0.226.
