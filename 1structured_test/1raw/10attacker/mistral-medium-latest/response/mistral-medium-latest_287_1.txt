To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The first witness's claim that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / P(W1)

From the information provided:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)

However, we still need P(W1), the probability of the first witness making the claim. We can find this using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H denotes the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬H) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm). We are given that the first witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2, so P(W1|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.24

Now we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 ≈ 0.5

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.5.
