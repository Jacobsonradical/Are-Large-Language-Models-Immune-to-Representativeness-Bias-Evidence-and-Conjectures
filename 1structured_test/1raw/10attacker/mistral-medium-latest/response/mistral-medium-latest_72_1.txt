To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(Tall) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15, according to information "a").
- P(Short) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85).
- P(W1|Tall) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as tall, given that they are tall (which is 0.8, according to information "b").
- P(W1|Short) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as tall, given that they are short (which is 0.2).
- P(W2|Tall) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as tall, given that they are tall (which is 0.7).
- P(W2|Short) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as short, given that they are tall (which is 0.3).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is tall, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(Tall|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(W1, W2)

The denominator P(W1, W2) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1, W2|Short) \* P(Short)

Given that the first witness says the attacker is tall and the second witness says the attacker is short, we have:

P(W1, W2|Tall) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(W2|Tall) = 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56

P(W1, W2|Short) = P(W1|Short) \* P(W2|Short) = 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06

So the denominator is:

P(W1, W2) = 0.56 \* 0.15 + 0.06 \* 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is tall is:

P(Tall|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(W1, W2) = 0.56 \* 0.15 / 0.135 = 0.6667

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6667}
