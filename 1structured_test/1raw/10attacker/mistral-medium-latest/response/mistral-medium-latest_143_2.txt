{probability: 0.59}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15 according to information "a".
2. Next, we need to consider the witness testimonies and their reliability. The first witness is correct 80% of the time, so the probability of them being correct when they say the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8. The second witness is correct 70% of the time, so the probability of them being correct when they say the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.
3. Since the witness testimonies are independent events, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
4. Let P(A) be the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(B) be the probability of the first witness saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and P(C) be the probability of the second witness saying the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
5. We want to find P(A|B,C), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.
6. Using Bayes' theorem, we have: P(A|B,C) = P(B|A,C) \* P(A|C) / P(B|C).
7. Since the witness testimonies are independent, we can simplify this to: P(A|B,C) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B).
8. We know that P(B|A) = 0.8, P(A) = 0.15, and P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24.
9. Therefore, P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.59.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.59.
