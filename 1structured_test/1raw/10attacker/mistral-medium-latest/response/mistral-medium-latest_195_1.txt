To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the base rates of heights in the population. We can use Bayes' theorem for this:

P(H|E1) = P(E1|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Here:
- H represents the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- E1 represents the testimony of the first witness
- P(H) is the prior probability of H, which is the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the population (0.15 or 15%)
- P(~H) is the prior probability of ~H, which is the base rate of people who are shorter than 185 cm (0.85 or 85%)
- P(E1|H) is the likelihood of the first witness' testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is the witness' accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller (0.8 or 80%)
- P(E1|~H) is the likelihood of the first witness' testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is the witness' error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm (0.2 or 20%)

We can now calculate the probability:

P(H|E1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E1) ≈ 0.20 or 20%

However, we also have the testimony of the second witness, which can be incorporated using the law of total probability:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E2|H, E1) \* P(H|E1) / [P(E2|H, E1) \* P(H|E1) + P(E2|~H, E1) \* P(~H|E1)]

Here:
- E2 represents the testimony of the second witness
- P(E2|H, E1) is the likelihood of the second witness' testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the first witness has already testified (this is the witness' accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller, 0.7 or 70%)
- P(E2|~H, E1) is the likelihood of the second witness' testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and the first witness has already testified (this is the witness' error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm, 0.3 or 30%)
- P(H|E1) and P(~H|E1) are as calculated above (0.2 and 0.8, respectively)

We can now calculate the probability:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.7 \* 0.2) / [(0.7 \* 0.2) + (0.3 \* 0.8)]
P(H|E1, E2) ≈ 0.19 or 19%

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.19 or 19%.
