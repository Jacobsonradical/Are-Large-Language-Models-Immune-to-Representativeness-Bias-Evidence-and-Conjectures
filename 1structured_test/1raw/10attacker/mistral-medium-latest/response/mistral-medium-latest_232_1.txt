To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as B. We want to find P(A|B).

Bayes' theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following information:

P(A) = 0.15 (from fact b, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from fact a, the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from fact b, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from fact a, the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

We can find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
