To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Define events: Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Calculate prior probabilities: From information (a), P(H) = 0.15 and P(¬H) = 0.85, where ¬H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
3. Calculate likelihoods: From information (b), the first witness's accuracy is as follows:
   - P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
4. Apply Bayes' theorem: P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Now, calculate the probability:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.281 / (0.281 + 0.17)
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.281 / 0.451
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.623

{probability: 0.623}
