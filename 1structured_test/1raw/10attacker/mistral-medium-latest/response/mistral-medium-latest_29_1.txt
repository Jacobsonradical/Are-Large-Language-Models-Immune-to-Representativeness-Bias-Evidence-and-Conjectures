To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness's testimony
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|H): The likelihood of the first witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W1|¬H): The likelihood of the first witness testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not 185 cm or taller = 0.2 (from information a)
P(¬H): The prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller = 0.85 (from information b)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Substituting the values:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.281 or 28.1%

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.281.
