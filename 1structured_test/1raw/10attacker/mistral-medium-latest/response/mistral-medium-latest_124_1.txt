To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Define the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller. According to information (b), this probability is 15%.
2. Define the likelihood P(E1|H) and P(E2|H), which are the probabilities that the first and second witnesses claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to information (a), these probabilities are 80% and 30%, respectively.
3. Define the likelihood P(E1|~H) and P(E2|~H), which are the probabilities that the first and second witnesses claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to information (a), these probabilities are 20% and 70%, respectively.
4. Calculate the posterior probability P(H|E1) using Bayes' theorem: P(H|E1) = [P(E1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(~H)]
5. Calculate the posterior probability P(H|E2) using Bayes' theorem: P(H|E2) = [P(E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E2|~H) \* P(~H)]
6. Since the two witnesses are independent, we can calculate the joint posterior probability P(H|E1, E2) as follows: P(H|E1, E2) = P(H|E1) \* P(H|E2) / [P(H|E1) \* P(H|E2) + P(~H|E1) \* P(~H|E2)]

Using the given information, we can calculate the probabilities as follows:

1. Prior probability P(H) = 0.15
2. Likelihoods P(E1|H) = 0.8, P(E2|H) = 0.3
3. Likelihoods P(E1|~H) = 0.2, P(E2|~H) = 0.7
4. Posterior probability P(H|E1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.333
5. Posterior probability P(H|E2) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)] = 0.069
6. Joint posterior probability P(H|E1, E2) = (0.333 \* 0.069) / [(0.333 \* 0.069) + (0.667 \* 0.931)] = 0.055

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.055 or 5.5%.
