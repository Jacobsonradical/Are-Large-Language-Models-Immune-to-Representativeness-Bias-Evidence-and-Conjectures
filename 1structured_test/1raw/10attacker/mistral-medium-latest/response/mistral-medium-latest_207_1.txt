To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we want to find)
- P(S) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are
- P(W1|S) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not
- P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are
- P(W2|S) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not

Given the information provided:

- P(T) = 0.15 (from part b)
- P(S) = 0.85 (from part b)
- P(W1|T) = 0.80 (from part a)
- P(W1|S) = 0.20 (from part a)
- P(W2|T) = 0.30 (since Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter, and this is false when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|S) = 0.70 (from part a)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \* P(S)]

Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 provide conflicting testimony, we have:

P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24

P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \* P(W2|S) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can find P(T|W1, W2):

P(T|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.223

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 0.223.
