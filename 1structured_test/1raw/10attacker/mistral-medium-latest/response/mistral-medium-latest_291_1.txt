To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) based on the population data: P(H) = 0.15
2. Calculate the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(E1|H)): P(E1|H) = 0.80
3. Calculate the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (P(E1|~H)): P(E1|~H) = 0.20
4. Calculate the likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(E2|H)): P(E2|H) = 0.30 (since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we use the error rate of 30%)
5. Calculate the likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (P(E2|~H)): P(E2|~H) = 0.70
6. Calculate the joint likelihood of both witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (P(E1, E2|H)): P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
7. Calculate the joint likelihood of both witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (P(E1, E2|~H)): P(E1, E2|~H) = P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14
8. Calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies (P(H|E1, E2)): P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) \* P(~H)] = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] = 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.119) = 0.24 / 0.359 = 0.668 (approximately)
