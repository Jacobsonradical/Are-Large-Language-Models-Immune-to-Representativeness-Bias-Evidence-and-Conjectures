To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(H'): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W1|H): The likelihood of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from information a)
P(W1|H'): The likelihood of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|H') \* P(H')]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we have:

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3571.
