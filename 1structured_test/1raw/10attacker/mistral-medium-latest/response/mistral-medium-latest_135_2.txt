To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witnesses' testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem for this.

First, let's define our events:
A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
C: Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we know that:
P(A) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from statement b)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from statement b, as the error rate for Witness 1 is 20%)

We also need to find P(C|A) and P(C|¬A):

P(C|A) = 0.3 (from statement b, as the second witness correctly identifies a person taller than 185 cm 70% of the time, so they would incorrectly identify the attacker as shorter 30% of the time)
P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (from statement b, as the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, so they would incorrectly identify the attacker as taller 30% of the time)

Now, we need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. Since both witnesses provided contradictory statements, we can treat this as two separate cases and then combine their probabilities.

First, let's find the probability considering Witness 1's testimony:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.357

Next, let's find the probability considering Witness 2's testimony:
P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / [P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|C) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.065

Since both witnesses provided contradictory statements, we can average the probabilities to get our final estimate:
P(A|B,C) ≈ (0.357 + 0.065) / 2 ≈ 0.211

{probability: 0.211}
