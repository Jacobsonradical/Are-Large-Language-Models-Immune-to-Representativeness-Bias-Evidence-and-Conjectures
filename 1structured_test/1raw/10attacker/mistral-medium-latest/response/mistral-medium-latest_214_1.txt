To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of H given W1 is:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

where ~H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know that:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to find P(W1|~H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases where the person's height is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(W1|~H) = 0.2

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3889

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the first witness, is approximately 0.3889, or 38.89%.
