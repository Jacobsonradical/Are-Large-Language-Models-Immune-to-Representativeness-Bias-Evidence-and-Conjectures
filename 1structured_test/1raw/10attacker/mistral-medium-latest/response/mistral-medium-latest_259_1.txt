To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information a.
P(~H) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
P(W1|H) as the probability of witness 1 reporting "185 cm or taller" given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 according to information b.
P(W1|~H) as the probability of witness 1 reporting "185 cm or taller" given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2.
P(W2|H) as the probability of witness 2 reporting "shorter than 185 cm" given that the person is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3.
P(W2|~H) as the probability of witness 2 reporting "shorter than 185 cm" given that the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7.

We are looking for the probability P(H|W1,W2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

First, we need to find P(W1,W2|H) and P(W1,W2|~H). Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the height of the attacker, we have:

P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate P(H|W1,W2):

P(H|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.1887

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1887 or 18.87%.
