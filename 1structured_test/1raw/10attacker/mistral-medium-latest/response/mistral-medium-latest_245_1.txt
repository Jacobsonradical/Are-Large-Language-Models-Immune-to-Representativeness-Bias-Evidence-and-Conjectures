To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information a.

P(~H) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W1|H) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are, which is 0.8 according to information b.

P(W1|~H) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not, which is 0.2.

P(W2|H) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3.

P(W2|~H) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that they are, which is 0.7.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(H|W1,W2) = [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 provide independent testimony, we can write:

P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

P(W1,W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1,W2) = [0.24 \* 0.15] / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.22

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.22.
