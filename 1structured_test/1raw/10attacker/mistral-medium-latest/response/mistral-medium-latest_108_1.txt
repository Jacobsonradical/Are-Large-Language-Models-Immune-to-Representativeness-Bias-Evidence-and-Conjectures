To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the reliability of the witnesses and the prior probability of encountering someone who is 185 cm or taller in the population. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability from information point b)
P(~H) = 0.85 (complementary probability)
P(W1|H) = 0.8 (reliability of the first witness when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (reliability of the first witness when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating this expression, we find:

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.378

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.378.
