To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
A: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem statement, we know the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(A|H) = 0.80 (from information a)
P(A|¬H) = 0.20 (from information a)
P(B|H) = 0.30 (from information a)
P(B|¬H) = 0.70 (from information a)

Since there are two witnesses, we need to consider the joint probability of both witnesses' testimonies. Given that the witnesses are independent, we have:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) \* P(B|A) = P(A|H) \* P(B|H) \* P(H) + P(A|¬H) \* P(B|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We want to find P(H|A ∩ B), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|A ∩ B) = P(A ∩ B|H) \* P(H) / P(A ∩ B)

Since P(A ∩ B|H) = P(B|H) and we've already calculated P(A ∩ B), we can find P(H|A ∩ B):

P(H|A ∩ B) = (P(B|H) \* P(H)) / P(A ∩ B)

Now we can calculate P(H|A ∩ B):

P(H|A ∩ B) = (0.30 \* 0.15) / P(A ∩ B)

We need to find P(A ∩ B) first:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A|H) \* P(B|H) \* P(H) + P(A|¬H) \* P(B|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(A ∩ B) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)
P(A ∩ B) ≈ 0.1395

Now we can find P(H|A ∩ B):

P(H|A ∩ B) = (0.30 \* 0.15) / 0.1395
P(H|A ∩ B) ≈ 0.3079

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.3079.
