To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We are looking for P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims it is. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)

However, we don't know P(W1) directly. We can calculate it using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We need to find P(W1|¬H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the false positive rate, which we know is 0.20 (the first witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now we can calculate P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
P(W1) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.5217

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.5217.
