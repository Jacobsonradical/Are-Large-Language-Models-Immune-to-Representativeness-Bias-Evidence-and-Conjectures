To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is stated mathematically as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:

1. P(A) = probability that a random individual in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
2. P(¬A) = probability that a random individual in the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
3. P(B|A) = probability that the first witness correctly identifies an individual who is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
4. P(B|¬A) = probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an individual who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 0.20

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4138.
