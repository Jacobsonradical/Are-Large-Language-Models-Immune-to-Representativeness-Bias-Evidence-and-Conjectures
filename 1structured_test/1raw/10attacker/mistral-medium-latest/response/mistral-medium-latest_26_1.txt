To find an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A) based on the population data. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(W1|A). Given that the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find the probability of the witness testifying A when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, P(W1|¬A). Since the witness errs 20% of the time, P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(A|W1) ≈ 0.3556

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3556.
