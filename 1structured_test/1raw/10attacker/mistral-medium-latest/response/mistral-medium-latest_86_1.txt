To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
A: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are looking for the probability P(H|A). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) / [P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the given information, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(A|H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A|¬H) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

However, we do not have the probability P(B|H) or P(B|¬H) directly. Since the second witness makes an independent observation, we can calculate the probability of the second witness's claim given the attacker's height using the information provided about their accuracy:

P(¬B|H) = 0.3 (the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, so they incorrectly identify an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
P(¬B|¬H) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability of the first witness's claim given the second witness's claim:

P(A|B) = 0 (since the witnesses' claims contradict each other, it is impossible for both to be true)
P(A|¬B) = [P(A and ¬B|H) \* P(H) + P(A and ¬B|¬H) \* P(¬H)] / P(¬B)

Since the witnesses make independent observations, we have:

P(A and ¬B|H) = P(A|H) \* P(¬B|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(A and ¬B|¬H) = P(A|¬H) \* P(¬B|¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

So,

P(¬B) = P(¬B|H) \* P(H) + P(¬B|¬H) \* P(¬H) = 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.605

And,

P(A|¬B) = (0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85) / 0.605 ≈ 0.248

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(H|A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) / [P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H|A) ≈ (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.411

If the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness contradicts this claim, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.411.
