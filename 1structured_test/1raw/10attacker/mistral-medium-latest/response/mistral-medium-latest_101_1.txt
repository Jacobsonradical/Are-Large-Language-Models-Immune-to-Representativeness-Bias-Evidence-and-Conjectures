To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W1), which is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We are given P(W1|A) and P(A), but we need to find P(W1|¬A) and P(¬A). Since P(A) = 0.15, we have:

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

We are also given that the first witness errs in identifying an attacker's height 20% of the time, so the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller is:

P(W1|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
