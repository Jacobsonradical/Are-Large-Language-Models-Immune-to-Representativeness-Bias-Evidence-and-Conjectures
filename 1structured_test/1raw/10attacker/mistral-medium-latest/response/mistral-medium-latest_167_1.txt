To find the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:
- H is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- ~H is the complementary event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- ~W is the complementary event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W|H) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- P(W|~H) = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3556 or 35.56%

However, this is only the probability based on the first witness's testimony. To incorporate the second witness's testimony, we need to consider their statement as additional evidence. Since the second witness provides conflicting information, we should treat it as a separate piece of evidence and update our probability using another application of Bayes' theorem or other methods such as likelihood ratios.

Without making any further assumptions, I cannot provide an updated probability that includes the second witness's testimony. However, based solely on the first witness's testimony and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3556.
