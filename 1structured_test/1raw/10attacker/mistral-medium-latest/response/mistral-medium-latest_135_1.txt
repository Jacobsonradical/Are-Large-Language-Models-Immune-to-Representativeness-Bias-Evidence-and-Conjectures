{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. We have two pieces of information: the general population distribution and the testimonies of the two witnesses.
2. The base rate probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15% (from information a).
3. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so the probability of them being correct when they say someone is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
4. The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time, so the probability of them being incorrect when they say someone is shorter than 185 cm is 0.3 (since they make mistakes 30% of the time).
5. To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem:

   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = [P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)]

6. We know that P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8, P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15, and P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.
7. We also need to find P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm). Since Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time, and 85% of the people are shorter than 185 cm, the probability of them saying someone is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.
8. Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.56.
