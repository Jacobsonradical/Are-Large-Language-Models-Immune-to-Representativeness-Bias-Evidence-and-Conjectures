To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:
P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from information a)

We also need to find P(W1|not H) and P(not H). From information a, we know that the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the first witness claiming a person is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is 0.20 \* (0.85) = 0.17.

Therefore, P(W1|not H) = 0.17 and P(not H) = 0.85.

Now we can find P(W1):
P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)
P(W1) ≈ 0.2025

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):
P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.2025
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.5926

{probability: 0.5926}
