To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, the new evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses.

First, we need to calculate the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. From information point b, we know that 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability is 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihood of the witness testimony given the attacker's height. From information point a, we know that the first witness can identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness can identify the correct height about 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8, and the likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.

However, we also need to take into account the fact that the witnesses may have made errors in their testimony. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2, and the likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.3.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where H is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, E is the evidence of the witness testimony, P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(E|H) is the likelihood of E given H, P(not H) is the probability of not H, and P(E|not H) is the likelihood of E given not H.

Using the information we have, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) \* (0.3 \* 0.15) / (0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85)]

= 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.104 \* (0.045 / 0.79)]

= 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.057]

= 0.12 / 0.177

= 0.678

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.678.
