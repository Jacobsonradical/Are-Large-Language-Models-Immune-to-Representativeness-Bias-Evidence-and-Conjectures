To calculate the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will consider two events: A represents the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and W1 represents the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability of event A (P(A)). According to the information provided, P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we'll find the probability of observing the witness's claim given the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (P(W1|A)). Since the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8.

Now, we need to find the probability of observing the witness's claim given the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (P(W1|¬A)). This can be calculated as follows: P(W1|¬A) = probability of error by the first witness = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can now calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the value of P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) ≈ 0.333

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.333.
