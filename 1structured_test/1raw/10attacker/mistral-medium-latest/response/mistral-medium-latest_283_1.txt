To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W. We want to find P(H|W).

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H). From information b, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the witness's claim given the attacker's height. From information a, we know that the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.8 when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, and incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller with probability 0.2 when they are shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the likelihood of the witness's claim given the attacker's height is:

* P(W|H) = 0.8 (when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
* P(W|not H) = 0.2 (when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)]

Substituting the values we found, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the value, we get:

P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.308

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.308.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.308}
