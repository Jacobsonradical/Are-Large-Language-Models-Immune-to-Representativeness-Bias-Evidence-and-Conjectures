To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the two witnesses and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses respectively testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W1|H) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller.
P(H) = 0.15, the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
P(W2|H') = 0.7, the probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm.
P(H') = 0.85, the probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

We can find P(W1) as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|H') \* P(H')

Since we don't know P(W1|H'), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller, we can use the complementary probability:

P(W1|H') = 1 - P(W1|H'')

where P(W1|H'') is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when identifying the heights of people shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(W1|H'') = 0.8, and therefore P(W1|H') = 0.2.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the first witness, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%. Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{probability: 0.414}
