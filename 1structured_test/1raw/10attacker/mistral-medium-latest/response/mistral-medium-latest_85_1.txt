To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's first define some variables:

H: The attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: The first witness's testimony
W2: The second witness's testimony
P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller
P(W1|H): Likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W2|¬H): Likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller

From the information provided, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (from b)
P(W2|H) = 0.30 (from b)
P(W2|¬H) = 0.70 (from b)

Since the witnesses provide conflicting testimonies, we can combine their likelihoods by taking the product of the probabilities of their testimonies given the hypothesis H.

P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24

However, this is not the correct likelihood to use in Bayes' theorem, as we need to consider the joint likelihood of both witnesses' testimonies given the hypothesis H, and normalize it by the sum of the joint likelihoods for both hypotheses H and ¬H.

P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = 0.24
P(W1 ∩ W2|¬H) = P(W1|¬H) \* P(W2|¬H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1 ∩ W2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.258 / (0.258 + 0.119) ≈ 0.681

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.681.
