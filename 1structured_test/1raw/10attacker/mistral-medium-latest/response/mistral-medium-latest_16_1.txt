To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account both the witness testimony and the prior probability of a person's height in the city.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness testifies to this as W1. Similarly, let's denote the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm as ~H, and the event that the second witness testifies to this as W2. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided, we know that:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.281 or 28.1%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.281.
