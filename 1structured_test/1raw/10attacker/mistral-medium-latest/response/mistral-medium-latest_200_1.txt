To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (from statement a).
P(W1|H) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (from statement b).
P(W1|~H) as the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

We are given the following values:

P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(W1|H) = 0.8 (from statement b)
P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases)
P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.2927

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2927.
