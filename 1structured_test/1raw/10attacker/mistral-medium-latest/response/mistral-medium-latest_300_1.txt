To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15 according to information a)
P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85 according to information a)
P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 according to information b)
P(W1|B) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.2 according to information b)
P(W2|A) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller (which is 0.3 according to information b)
P(W2|B) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.7 according to information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1,W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1,W2|B) \* P(B)]

The probability that both witnesses testify as they did, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is:

P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) = (0.8) \* (0.3) = 0.24

The probability that both witnesses testify as they did, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is:

P(W1,W2|B) = P(W1|B) \* P(W2|B) = (0.2) \* (0.7) = 0.14

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is:

P(A|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] = 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.12) = 0.597

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.597.
