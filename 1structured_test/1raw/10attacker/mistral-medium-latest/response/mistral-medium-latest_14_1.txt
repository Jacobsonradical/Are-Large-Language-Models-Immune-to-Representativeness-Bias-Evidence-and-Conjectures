To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem for this.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively. We want to find P(A|B1).

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1)

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

Since the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are indeed 185 cm or taller, P(B1|A) = 0.8.

To find P(B1), we need to consider both possibilities for the attacker's height (A and not A) and the corresponding witness testimonies:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|not A) \* P(not A)

The first witness incorrectly testifies that someone is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter, so P(B1|not A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(B1):

P(B1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.214

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1):

P(A|B1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.214 ≈ 0.561

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.561.
