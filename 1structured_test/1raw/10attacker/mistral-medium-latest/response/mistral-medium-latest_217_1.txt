To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H) given the testimony of the first witness (W1). We can write this as P(H|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express this probability as follows:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

where P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on the population statistics), P(W1|H) is the likelihood that the first witness would testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually is, P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(W1|~H) is the likelihood that the first witness would testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker actually isn't.

From the information provided, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(W1|H) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (since the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
