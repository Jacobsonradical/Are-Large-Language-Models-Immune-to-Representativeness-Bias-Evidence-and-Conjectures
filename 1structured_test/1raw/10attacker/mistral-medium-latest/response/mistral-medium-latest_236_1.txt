To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1).

From the information given, we know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 0.85.

We also know that the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time. Therefore, P(W1|H) = 0.80.

To find P(W1|~H), we can use the fact that the witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time. Since the witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, they must have erred in their judgment. Therefore, P(W1|~H) = 0.30.

Finally, we can find P(W1) by using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85)
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.255
P(W1) = 0.375

Now we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.375
P(H|W1) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.32.
