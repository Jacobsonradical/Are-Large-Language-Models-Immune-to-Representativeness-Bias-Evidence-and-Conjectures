To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 represent the event that the first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then, we want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given that P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. We are also given that P(W1|A) = 0.8, since the first witness is able to identify the correct height with 80% accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(W1), we need to consider the probability that the witness makes the claim regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated as:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|~A) \* P(~A)

where ~A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that P(W1|~A) = 0.2, since the first witness errs with 20% accuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm. We can also find P(~A) = 0.85, since 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W1) as:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
