To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H1, and the event that the attacker is shorter as H2. We want to find P(H1|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) / [P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) + P(W1|H2) \* P(H2)]

From the information provided, we know that:

P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(H2) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|H1) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|H2) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H1|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.357.
