To find an estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)

We need to calculate P(W1), which is the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height. Since there are two possible height categories (shorter than 185 cm and 185 cm or taller), and two witnesses with different error rates, we need to consider the possibility that Witness 1 could have made an error when observing an attacker shorter than 185 cm.

Let W2 represent the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witnesses gave opposite testimonies, we know that W1 and W2 are complementary events (i.e., P(W1) + P(W2) = 1). We want to find P(W1) in terms of probabilities involving Witness 1 only.

We know that Witness 2 has an accuracy of 0.7 and errors 30% of the time, so:

P(W2|not H) = 0.7
P(W2|H) = 0.3

Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 gave opposite testimonies, we can express P(W1) in terms of P(W2) as follows:

P(W1) = 1 - P(W2)

Now we can find P(W1) in terms of probabilities involving Witness 1:

P(W1) = 1 - [P(W2|not H) \* P(not H) + P(W2|H) \* P(H)]

We know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. Substituting the known values:

P(W1) = 1 - [0.7 \* 0.85 + 0.3 \* 0.15]

Now that we have P(W1) and P(W1|H), we can calculate P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / P(W1)

Substitute P(W1) from the previous calculation:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / (1 - [0.7 \* 0.85 + 0.3 \* 0.15])

Calculate the final probability:
