To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability we want to find is P(H|W1), which can be calculated as:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W1|H) = The probability that the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is equal to the witness's accuracy rate in identifying tall people, which is 80%.

P(H) = The probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This probability is equal to the proportion of people in the population who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15%.

P(~H) = The probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This probability is equal to the proportion of people in the population who are shorter than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Since we want to find P(H|W1), we also need to calculate P(W1|~H), which is the probability that the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is equal to the witness's error rate in identifying short people, which is 20%.

Now we can calculate P(H|W1) as follows:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
= 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
