To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the given information, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)

P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b, since the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)

Now we need to find P(W1), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can happen in two ways: either the attacker is tall, and the witness correctly identifies them as tall, or the attacker is short, and the witness incorrectly identifies them as tall. So we have:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We already know P(W1|H) and P(H). We need to find P(W1|not H) and P(not H). Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm:

P(not H) = 0.85

And from the information about the second witness, we can infer that:

P(not W1|H) = 0.20 (the second witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)
P(W1|not H) = 1 - P(not W1|H) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time, so the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 30% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.30 \* 0.85
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.255
P(W1) = 0.375

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.375
P(H|W1) = 0.12 / 0.375
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.32

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.32.
