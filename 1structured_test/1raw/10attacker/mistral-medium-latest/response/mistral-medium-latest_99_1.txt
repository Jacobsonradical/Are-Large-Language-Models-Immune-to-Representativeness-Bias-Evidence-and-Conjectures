To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account both the prior probability of the attacker's height and the witnesses' testimonies.

First, let's calculate the prior probability based on the population distribution:
P(H≥185) = 0.15
P(H<185) = 0.85

Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height.

For Witness 1:
L(W1|H≥185) = 0.8 (80% chance of correctly identifying a tall person)
L(W1|H<185) = 0.2 (20% chance of incorrectly identifying a short person as tall)

For Witness 2:
L(W2|H≥185) = 0.3 (30% chance of incorrectly identifying a tall person as short)
L(W2|H<185) = 0.7 (70% chance of correctly identifying a short person)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H≥185|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|H≥185) \* P(H≥185)] / [P(W1, W2|H≥185) \* P(H≥185) + P(W1, W2|H<185) \* P(H<185)]

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we have:

P(W1, W2|H≥185) = L(W1|H≥185) \* L(W2|H≥185) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|H<185) = L(W1|H<185) \* L(W2|H<185) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H≥185|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.2097

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2097.
