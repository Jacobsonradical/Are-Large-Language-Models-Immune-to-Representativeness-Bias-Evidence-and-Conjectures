To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H1 represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H1|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H1|W1) = P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we have:

P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W1|H1) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) + P(W1|H0) \* P(H0)

Where H0 represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and P(H0) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, P(W1|H0) = 0.20.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H1|W1):

P(H1|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.38

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed they were 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.38.
