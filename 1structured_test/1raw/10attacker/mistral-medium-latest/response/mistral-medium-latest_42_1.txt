To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 80% accuracy when they are indeed 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we do not have the probability P(W1|~H), which represents the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, this probability is:

P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller with 20% error rate when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can plug these probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.36

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36.
