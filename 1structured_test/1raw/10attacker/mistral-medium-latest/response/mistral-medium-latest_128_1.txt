To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information b.
P(F) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 based on information b.
P(A|T) as the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they are, which is 0.8 based on information a.
P(A|F) as the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, which is 0.2 based on information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness' testimony:

P(T|A) = [P(A|T) \* P(T)] / [P(A|T) \* P(T) + P(A|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|A) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / ([0.8 \* 0.15] + [0.2 \* 0.85])

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(T|A) ≈ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, we also have the testimony of the second witness, who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the second witness' testimony:

P(F|A') = [P(A'|F) \* P(F)] / [P(A'|F) \* P(F) + P(A'|T) \* P(T)]

where P(A'|F) is the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that they are, which is 0.7 based on information a.
P(A'|T) is the probability of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not, which is 0.3 based on information a.

Plugging in the values:

P(F|A') = [0.7 \* 0.85] / ([0.7 \* 0.85] + [0.3 \* 0.15])

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(F|A') ≈ 0.966 or 96.6%

Since the second witness' testimony is more reliable than the first witness' testimony (based on their accuracy rates), we can use this to revise our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Therefore, our final estimate is:

{probability: 1 - 0.966, which is approximately 0.034 or 3.4%}
