To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account both prior probabilities (information "a") and the witnesses' testimonies (information "b").

Let's denote:

- H: The event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- W1: The event that Witness 1 testifies that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- W2: The event that Witness 2 testifies that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|W1 ∩ W2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1 ∩ W2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the event H, we have:
P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H)

From information "a" and "b":

- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of people are 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of people are shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (80% chance Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person)
- P(W2|H) = 0.3 (30% chance Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a tall person)

Now we can calculate P(W1 ∩ W2|H):
P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

We also need to calculate the denominator P(W1 ∩ W2):

P(W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1 ∩ W2|~H) \* P(~H)

Since witness testimonies are conflicting, P(W1 ∩ W2|~H) = 0 (a person cannot be both tall and short). Therefore:

P(W1 ∩ W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0 \* 0.85 = 0.036

Now we can calculate P(H|W1 ∩ W2):

P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1 ∩ W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / 0.036 ≈ 0.944

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies, is approximately 0.944.
