To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis. In this case, the hypothesis is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and the evidence is the testimony of the first witness. The prior probability of the hypothesis is given by the fact that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%. Therefore, the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)

We know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(E|H) = 0.8. However, we don't know P(E), the probability of the evidence. To calculate P(E), we need to consider the possibility that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm and the first witness incorrectly identifies their height as being 185 cm or taller. The probability of this happening is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm multiplied by the probability that the first witness makes an error, which is 0.85 \* 0.2 = 0.17. Therefore, the probability of the evidence is:

P(E) = P(E and H) + P(E and not H)
= P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17
= 0.205

Therefore, the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / P(E)
= [0.8 \* 0.15] / 0.205
= 0.5854

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.5854 or 58.54%.
