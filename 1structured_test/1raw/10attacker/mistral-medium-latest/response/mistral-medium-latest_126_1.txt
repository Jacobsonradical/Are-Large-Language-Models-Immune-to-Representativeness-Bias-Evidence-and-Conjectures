To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the product of the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (H) given the testimony of the first witness (E). The prior probability of the hypothesis can be obtained from fact (b), which states that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis can be obtained from fact (a), which states that the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:

* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is 0.15 in this case.
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis, which is 0.8 in this case.
* P(not H) is the prior probability of the negation of the hypothesis, which is 1 - P(H) = 0.85 in this case.
* P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the negation of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the witness will err on a randomly selected person who is shorter than 185 cm is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.357.

Answer: {probability: 0.357}
