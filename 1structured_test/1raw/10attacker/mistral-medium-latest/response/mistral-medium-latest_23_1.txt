To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the given probabilities:

1. Prior probability P(H) of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15 (from information b).
2. Sensitivity or true positive rate of witness 1 (W1) is 80% or 0.8 (from information a). This is the probability of witness 1 identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller [P(W1|H)].
3. False positive rate of witness 1 is 20% or 0.2 (from information a). This is the probability of witness 1 identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm [P(W1|¬H)].

Now, we want to find the posterior probability P(H|W1), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 identified them as such. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the given probabilities:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.36

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of witness 1, is approximately 0.36.
