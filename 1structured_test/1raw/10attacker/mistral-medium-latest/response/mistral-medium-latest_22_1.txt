To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)

We also need to find P(W1|¬H) and P(¬H), where ¬H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We are given:

P(¬H) = 0.85 (from a)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (from b)

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(W1) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.23
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.522.
