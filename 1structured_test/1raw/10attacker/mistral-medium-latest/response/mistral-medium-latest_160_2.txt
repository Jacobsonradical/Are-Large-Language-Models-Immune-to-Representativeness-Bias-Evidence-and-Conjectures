To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood P(W1|H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time, P(W1|H) = 0.8.

Finally, we need to find the probability P(W1), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(W1) as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

where ¬H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness claims that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we can use the second witness's accuracy rate to estimate P(W1|¬H), which is the probability that the first witness makes an error when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness is able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time, and the witnesses disagree on the attacker's height, we can assume that the first witness errs in 30% of the cases where the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(W1|¬H) = 0.3.

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

P(W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.3 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.31

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem again to find the posterior probability P(H|W1), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

Substituting the values we have obtained, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.31 ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.36 or 36%.
