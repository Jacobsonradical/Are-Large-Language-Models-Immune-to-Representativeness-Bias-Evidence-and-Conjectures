To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on the population data).
P(~H) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(E1|H) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are.
P(E1|~H) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not.
P(E2|H) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller.
P(E2|~H) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not.

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85
P(E1|H) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
P(E1|~H) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)
P(E2|H) = 0.30 (The second witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 30% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
P(E2|~H) = 0.70 (The second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we want to find P(H|E1 ∩ E2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1 ∩ E2) = P(E1 ∩ E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1 ∩ E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1 ∩ E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent events, we have:

P(E1 ∩ E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)
P(E1 ∩ E2|~H) = P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H)

Plugging in the values:

P(E1 ∩ E2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(E1 ∩ E2|~H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the final probability:

P(H|E1 ∩ E2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E1 ∩ E2) ≈ 0.184 / (0.184 + 0.119)
P(H|E1 ∩ E2) ≈ 0.184 / 0.303
P(H|E1 ∩ E2) ≈ 0.607

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 0.607.
