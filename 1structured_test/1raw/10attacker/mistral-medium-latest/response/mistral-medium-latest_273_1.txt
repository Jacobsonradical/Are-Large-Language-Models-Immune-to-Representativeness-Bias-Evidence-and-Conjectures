To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the testimony of the witnesses.

1. First, let's consider the population distribution (information "a"):
   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
   P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

2. Next, let's consider the testimony of the witnesses (information "b"):
   P(First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 80% = 0.8
   P(First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 20% = 0.2

   P(Second witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller) = 30% = 0.3
   P(Second witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 70% = 0.7

3. Since the first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we want to find the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given this testimony:
   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness says so)

   Using Bayes' theorem:
   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness says so) = P(First witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(First witness says so)

   P(First witness says so) = P(First witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(First witness says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   P(First witness says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)

   Now, we can calculate the desired probability:
   P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
