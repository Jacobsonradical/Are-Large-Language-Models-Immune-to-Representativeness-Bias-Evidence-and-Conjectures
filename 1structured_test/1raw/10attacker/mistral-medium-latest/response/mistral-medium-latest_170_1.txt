To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we have prior probabilities P(H) = 0.15 and P(not H) = 0.85. We also have conditional probabilities P(W1|H) = 0.8, P(W1|not H) = 0.2, P(W2|H) = 0.3, and P(W2|not H) = 0.7.

Since we want to find the probability P(H|W1), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.36

However, we should also consider the evidence provided by the second witness. Since the witnesses gave contradicting statements, we can use the law of total probability to incorporate the second witness's evidence:

P(H) = P(H|W1) \* P(W1) + P(H|W2) \* P(W2)

Since the witnesses are independent, we have P(W1) = P(W2) = 0.5. We can calculate P(H|W2) using Bayes' theorem as well:

P(H|W2) = P(W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W2|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W2) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.07

Now we can calculate the updated P(H) using the law of total probability:

P(H) = P(H|W1) \* 0.5 + P(H|W2) \* 0.5

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H) ≈ 0.36 \* 0.5 + 0.07 \* 0.5 ≈ 0.215

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.215.
