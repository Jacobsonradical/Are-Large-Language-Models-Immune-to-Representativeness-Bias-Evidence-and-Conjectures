To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (The first witness is able to correctly identify an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller regardless of their true height, we need to consider the possibility that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. Let S represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Then:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)

We know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(S) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. We also need to find P(W1|S), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that their height is actually shorter than 185 cm. From the information provided, we know that the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, so:

P(W1|S) = 0.20

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.09 / 0.29
= 0.3103

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3103.
