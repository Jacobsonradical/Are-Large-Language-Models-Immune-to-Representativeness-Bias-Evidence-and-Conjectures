To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The first witness's claim
P(H): Prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information a)
P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W1|H): Likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W1|~H): Likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information b)

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3855

{probability: 0.3855}
