To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), which can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(not A) = 0.85 (from a)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from b)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the height is not 185 cm or taller)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.345

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.345.
