To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where H is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, E is the evidence provided by the first witness, and P(H) and P(not H) are the prior probabilities of the attacker being 185 cm or taller or shorter, respectively.

From the information given, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
* P(not H) = 0.85
* P(E|H) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(E|not H) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate:

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence provided by the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
