{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to consider the base rate of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
2. Next, we need to consider the testimony of the two witnesses. The first witness has an 80% accuracy rate, so the probability that they are correct when they say the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.8. The second witness has a 70% accuracy rate, so the probability that they are incorrect when they say the attacker was shorter than 185 cm is 0.3 (since they have a 30% error rate).
3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness says so and second witness says not so) = [P(First witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Second witness says not so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / [P(First witness says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Second witness says not so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(First witness says so | Attacker is not 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm) \* P(Second witness says not so | Attacker is not 185 cm)]

4. Plugging in the values, we get:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness says so and second witness says not so) = [(0.8 \* 0.15 \* 0.3) / ((0.8 \* 0.15 \* 0.3) + (0.2 \* 0.85 \* 0.7))] = 0.56

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.56.
