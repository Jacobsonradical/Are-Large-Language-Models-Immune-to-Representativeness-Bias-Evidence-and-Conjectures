To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates, as well as the population distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:

- P(H) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population distribution (information b).
- P(W1|H) is the likelihood of the first witness testifying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy rate (information a).
- P(W1|~H) is the likelihood of the first witness testifying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on the witness's error rate (information a).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Now let's calculate P(H|W2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the second witness:

P(H|W2) = [P(W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

where:

- P(W2|H) is the likelihood of the second witness testifying that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 based on the witness's error rate (information a).
- P(W2|~H) is the likelihood of the second witness testifying that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is 0.7 based on the witness's accuracy rate (information a).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W2) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)]

Now we need to combine the probabilities obtained from each witness's testimony using a weighted average. Since we don't have information on how to weigh the witnesses' testimonies, we'll assume they are equally important:

P(H|W1, W2) = [(P(H|W1) \* P(W1)) + (P(H|W2) \* P(W2))] / [(P(W1) + P(W2))]

Since both witnesses have an equal chance of being called upon in court, we can assume P(W1) = P(W2) = 0.5.

Plugging in the values for P(H|W1) and P(H|W2) calculated earlier, we get:

P(H|W1, W2) = [((0.36) \* 0.5) + ((0.0675) \* 0.5)] / [0.5 + 0.5]

Simplifying the expression:

P(H|W1, W2) = 0.21375

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates, as well as the population distribution, is approximately 0.214.
