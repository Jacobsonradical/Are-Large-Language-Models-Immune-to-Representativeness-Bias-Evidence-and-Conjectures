To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. Here, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses.

Let's denote the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as P(H). From the second piece of information, we know that P(H) = 0.15, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, as P(E1|H). From the first piece of information, we know that P(E1|H) = 0.8, since the first witness is able to identify the correct height 80% of the time.

Similarly, let's denote the probability that the second witness testifies that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, as P(E2|H). Since the second witness errs 30% of the time, we have P(E2|H) = 0.3.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

where P(E1, E2|H) is the probability that both witnesses testify as they did, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(E1, E2) is the probability of observing the testimony of both witnesses, regardless of the attacker's height.

Since the testimony of the two witnesses is independent, we have:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

To calculate P(E1, E2), we need to consider all possible combinations of testimony and height:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|not H) \* P(not H)

where P(not H) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the second piece of information, we know that P(not H) = 0.85.

Since the first witness errs 20% of the time and the second witness errs 30% of the time, the probability that both witnesses testify that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56. Therefore, the probability that both witnesses testify as they did, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.

Putting it all together, we have:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / ((0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.44 \* 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.072

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.072 or 7.2%.
