To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A) and the likelihood P(W1|A). From information b, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8.

Next, we need to find the probability of the witness's testimony P(W1). Using the law of total probability, we have:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From information a, we know that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(W1|¬A) = 0.2. From information b, we know that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so P(¬A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

Substituting the values we found earlier, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
