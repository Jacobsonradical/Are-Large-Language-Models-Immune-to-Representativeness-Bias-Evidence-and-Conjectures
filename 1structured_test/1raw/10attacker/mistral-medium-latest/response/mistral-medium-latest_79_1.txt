To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability P(A|W1). Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given that P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. We are also given that P(W1|A) = 0.8, since the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

To find P(W1), we need to consider the probability that Witness 1 would claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. From the information provided, we know that the second witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. Since there are only two witnesses and they disagree about the attacker's height, we can assume that the second witness must have claimed that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, the first witness must have erred in claiming that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller when the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm. We are given that the first witness errs 20% of the time, so the probability of this error is 0.2.

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. Therefore, the probability that Witness 1 would claim the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

Now we can compute P(W1) as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.1445
= 0.2645

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.2645
= 0.09 / 0.2645
= 0.3403

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.34, or 34%.
