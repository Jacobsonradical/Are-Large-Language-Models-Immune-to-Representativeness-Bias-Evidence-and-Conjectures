{probability: 0.558}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to find the probability that the first witness is correct, given their accuracy rate of 80%. Let's denote this as P(W1|C), where W1 stands for witness 1 and C stands for "correct." So, P(W1|C) = 0.8
2. Next, we need to find the probability that the first witness is incorrect, given their error rate of 20%. Let's denote this as P(W1|I), where I stands for "incorrect." So, P(W1|I) = 0.2
3. Similarly, for the second witness, we have P(W2|C) = 0.7 and P(W2|I) = 0.3
4. Since the witnesses' testimonies are contradictory, we need to consider the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the population distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller or equal). Let's denote this as P(H), where H stands for "height." So, P(H) = 0.15 for "taller or equal" and P(H) = 0.85 for "shorter."
5. Now, we can calculate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given both witness testimonies and the population distribution, using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1, W2) = [P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

6. Substituting the values, we get:

P(H|W1, W2) = [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.558

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.558.
