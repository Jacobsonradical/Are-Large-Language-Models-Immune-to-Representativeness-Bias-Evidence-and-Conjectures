To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they were.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given the following information:

* P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be written as:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A^c) \* P(A^c)

where A^c represents the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We are given that:

* P(W1|A^c) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
* P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims they were, is approximately 0.4138.
