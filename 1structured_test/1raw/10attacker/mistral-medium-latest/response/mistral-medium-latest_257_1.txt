To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know that:
P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from statement b)

However, we don't know P(W1) yet. To find it, we can use the law of total probability:
P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

Since the witness makes an error 20% of the time when the person's height is actually 185 cm or taller, they must make a correct judgement 80% of the time when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm (assuming that the witness's errors are symmetric). Therefore, P(W1|not H) = 0.80.

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.80 \* 0.85) = 0.76

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):
P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.76 â‰ˆ 0.171

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.171.
