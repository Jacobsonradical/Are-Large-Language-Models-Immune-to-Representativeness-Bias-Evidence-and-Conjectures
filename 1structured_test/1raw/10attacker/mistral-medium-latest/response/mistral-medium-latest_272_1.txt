To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We'll use Bayes' theorem for this calculation.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

We can use the following form of Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the problem statement, we have:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies an attacker's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

However, we don't have P(B|¬A) directly. To find this probability, we need to use the second witness's testimony since they claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Let C represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Since the witnesses provide conflicting testimonies, we know that P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(C|A). We are given that P(C|A) = 0.30 (The second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when they are actually 185 cm or taller).

Therefore, P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(C|A) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.70 \* 0.85)]

After calculating the expression, we get:

P(A|B) ≈ 0.172

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.172.
