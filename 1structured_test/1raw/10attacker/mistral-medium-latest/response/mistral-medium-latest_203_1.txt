To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution (information a) and the witness testimonies (information b).

First, let's consider the prior probability based on the population distribution:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15

Next, let's incorporate the witness testimony using Bayes' theorem. We'll calculate the posterior probability for the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness's claim) = (P(First witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)) / P(First witness's claim)

We know that P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15. The first witness correctly identifies the height of people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(First witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.

However, we don't know the value of P(First witness's claim) yet. To calculate this, we need to consider both the possibilities of the attacker's height:

P(First witness's claim) = P(First witness's claim | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(First witness's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is indeed shorter than 185 cm, P(First witness's claim | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2. We also know that P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (from information a).

Now, we can calculate P(First witness's claim):
P(First witness's claim) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.24

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | First witness's claim) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 ≈ 0.4583

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4583.
