To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some terms:

P(H) - Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is based on the population distribution given in information b.
P(~H) - Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.

P(E1|H) - The probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are.
P(E1|~H) - The probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that they actually are not.

P(E2|H) - The probability that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that they actually are 185 cm or taller.
P(E2|~H) - The probability that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that they actually are.

From the given information, we have:

P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85
P(E1|H) = 0.80
P(E1|~H) = 0.20
P(E2|H) = 0.30
P(E2|~H) = 0.70

Now we can calculate the posterior probability P(H|E1, E2) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

First, find the probabilities of both witnesses making their respective claims given each possible height:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E2|H) \* P(E1|H) = 0.30 \* 0.80 = 0.24
P(E1, E2|~H) = P(E2|~H) \* P(E1|~H) = 0.70 \* 0.20 = 0.14

Now, plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E1, E2) â‰ˆ 0.198 or 19.8%

However, this calculation assumes that the witnesses' testimonies are independent. In reality, they might not be, and further information or assumptions would be needed to accurately determine the probability.

Nevertheless, based on the provided information and assuming independence, the estimate is:

{probability: 0.198}
