To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller.
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population data (b).
P(W1|H): The probability that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller given that the height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate when the person is tall, which is 0.8 (from a).
P(W1|¬H): The probability that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller given that the height is shorter than 185 cm. This is the witness's error rate when the person is not tall, which is 0.2 (from a).

Now we can calculate the probability of interest, P(H|W1), using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values we have:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(H|W1) ≈ 0.2857 or 28.57%

Therefore, my estimate is:
{probability: 0.2857}
