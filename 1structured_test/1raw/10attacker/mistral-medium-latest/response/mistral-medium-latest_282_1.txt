To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (15%, based on the population data).
P(B) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (85%, based on the population data).
P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller (80%, based on the witness's accuracy data).
P(W1|B) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (20%, based on the witness's accuracy data).

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|B) \* P(B)]

Now, we can plug in the values:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression above, we get:

P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.2807

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's testimony, is approximately 28.07%.
