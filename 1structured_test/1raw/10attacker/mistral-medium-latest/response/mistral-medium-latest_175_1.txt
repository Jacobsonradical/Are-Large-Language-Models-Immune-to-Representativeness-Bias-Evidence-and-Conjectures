To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85
P(W|H) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W|~H) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.3846

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.3846.
