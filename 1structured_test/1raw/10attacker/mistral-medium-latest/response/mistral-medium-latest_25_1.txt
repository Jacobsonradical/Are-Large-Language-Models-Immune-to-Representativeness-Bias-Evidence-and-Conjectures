To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis. In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is the testimony of the first witness.

The prior probability of the hypothesis can be estimated from the information in (b). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, the prior probability of the hypothesis is 0.15.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis can be estimated from the information in (a). Since the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is 0.8.

Therefore, by Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence is:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

The probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false (i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm) can be estimated from the information in (a) as well. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false is:

P(E|not H) = 0.2

The prior probability of the hypothesis being false is 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.45

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.45.
