To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population statistics.

First, let's calculate the weighted probability based on the witness testimonies:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | first witness) = 0.20 (since the first witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness) = 0.30/0.70 ≈ 0.43 (since the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time, the probability of them being wrong and the attacker being tall is the inverse of this)
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | second witness) = 0.70 (since the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

Next, let's calculate the prior probability based on the population statistics:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | prior) = 0.15
P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | prior) = 0.85

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probabilities with the witness testimonies:

For the first witness:
P(first witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
P(first witness | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) = (P(first witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | prior)) / (P(first witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | prior) + P(first witness | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | prior))

For the second witness:
P(second witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.43
P(second witness | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.70
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness) = (P(second witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | prior)) / (P(second witness | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | prior) + P(second witness | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm | prior))

Calculating these probabilities:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness) ≈ 0.47
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness) ≈ 0.12

Since we have two independent pieces of evidence, we can multiply these probabilities to get the overall probability:
P(attacker is 185 cm or taller | both witnesses) ≈ 0.47 \* 0.12 ≈ 0.056

{probability: 0.056}
