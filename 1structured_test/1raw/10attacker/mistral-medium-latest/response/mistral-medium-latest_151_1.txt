To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem, P(A|W1) can be calculated as follows:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')]

where P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, P(A') is the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, P(W1|A) is the likelihood that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and P(W1|A') is the likelihood that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is able to identify the correct height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A') = 0.20 (the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.357 or 35.7%.
