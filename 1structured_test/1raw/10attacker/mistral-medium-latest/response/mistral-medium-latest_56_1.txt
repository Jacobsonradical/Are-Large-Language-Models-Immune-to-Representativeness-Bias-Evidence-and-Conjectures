To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which takes into account both the witness testimonies and the prior probability of a person's height in the city.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses testify that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, respectively. We are given the following probabilities:

* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability based on population data)
* P(B1|A) = 0.80 (probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B2|A) = 0.30 (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
* P(B1|¬A) = 0.20 (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
* P(B2|¬A) = 0.70 (probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified that it was. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1)

First, we need to find P(B1). By the law of total probability, we have:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
≈ 0.18 + 0.17
≈ 0.35

Now we can find P(A|B1):

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1)
≈ 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.35
≈ 0.12 / 0.35
≈ 0.343

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and the prior probability of a person's height in the city, is approximately 0.343.
