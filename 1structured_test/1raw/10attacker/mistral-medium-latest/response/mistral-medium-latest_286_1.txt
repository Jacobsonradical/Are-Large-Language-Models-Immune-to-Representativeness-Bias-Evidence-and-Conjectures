To solve this problem, we need to consider both the population statistics and the witness testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses claim the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, respectively. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information provided:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.338

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.338.
