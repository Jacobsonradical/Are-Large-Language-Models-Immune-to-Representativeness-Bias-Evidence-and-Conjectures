To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then, we want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) \* P(A)] / P(W1)

We are given:
P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (from information a)

We also need to find P(W1|¬A) and P(¬A), where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(¬A) = 0.85 (from information b)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (since the first witness errs 20% of the time)

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Plugging in the values:

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
