To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

First, let's find the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80%.

Next, let's find the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time, this probability is 20%.

Similarly, let's find the probability that the second witness would testify that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm. This probability is given as 70%.

Next, let's find the probability that the second witness would testify that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the witness errs 30% of the time, this probability is 30%.

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that both witnesses testify that the attacker's height is not the same.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we have:

P(B|A) = P(first witness testifies shorter | attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(second witness testifies shorter | attacker is 185 cm or taller)
= 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06

P(B|not A) = P(first witness testifies taller | attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(second witness testifies shorter | attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 \* 0.7 = 0.56

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)
= 0.06 \* 0.15 + 0.56 \* 0.85
= 0.09 + 0.476
= 0.566

Therefore, P(A|B) = (0.06 \* 0.15) / 0.566
= 0.009 / 0.566
= 0.016

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is 0.016.
