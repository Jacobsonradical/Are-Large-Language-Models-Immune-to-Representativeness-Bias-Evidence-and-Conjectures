To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on the general population), which is 0.15 (from information a).

P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from information a).

P(W1|A) as the likelihood that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 (from information b).

P(W1|B) as the likelihood that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 (from information b).

P(W2|A) as the likelihood that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30 (from information b).

P(W2|B) as the likelihood that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70 (from information b).

Now we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses, denoted as P(A|W1, W2). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1, W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1, W2|B) \* P(B)]

Since the witnesses are independent, we can write P(W1, W2|A) as P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) and P(W1, W2|B) as P(W1|B) \* P(W2|B).

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:

P(A|W1, W2) ≈ 0.144 / (0.144 + 0.112) ≈ 0.144 / 0.256 ≈ 0.5625

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.5625.
