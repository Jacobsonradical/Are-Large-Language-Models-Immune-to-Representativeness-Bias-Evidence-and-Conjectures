{probability: 0.57}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the information about the population distribution (information "a"): 15% or 0.15.
2. Next, let's incorporate the witness testimonies using Bayes' theorem. The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) * P(Attacker is 185+ cm) / P(Witness 1 testimony)

Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability that they would testify so is 0.8.

P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.15

We need to find P(Witness 1 testimony). To do this, we can consider both possibilities: the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(Attacker is < 185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185+ cm) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

When the person is shorter than 185 cm, the witness incorrectly testifies that they are 185 cm or taller 20% of the time (error rate):

P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.2

Now we can find P(Witness 1 testimony):

P(Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Attacker is 185+ cm) + P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is < 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is < 185 cm)

P(Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185+ cm | Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.096 / 0.29 ≈ 0.331

3. However, we also have the testimony of the second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. To incorporate this information, we can consider the probability that both witnesses would testify as they did, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Since the second witness errs 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, they would erroneously testify that a person 185 cm or taller is shorter 0.3 of the time.

P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.3

Now we can calculate the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(Both witness testimonies | Attacker is 185+ cm) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) \* P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.331 \* 0.3 ≈ 0.0993

4. However, we don't know the exact probability of both witnesses testifying as they did, regardless of the attacker's height. To account for this uncertainty, we can compare our calculated probability with a scenario where both witnesses are equally likely to testify as they did, regardless of the attacker's height (in other words, where the witnesses' testimonies are independent of the attacker's height). In this case, the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did would be the product of their respective error rates when the attacker is 185 cm or taller and when they are shorter:

P(Both witness testimonies | Attacker is 185+ cm) = 0.3 \* 0.2 = 0.06
P(Both witness testimonies | Attacker is < 185 cm) = 0.2 \* 0.3 = 0.06

Since both probabilities are equal, we cannot use this scenario to discriminate between the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm.

5. Nevertheless, we can still estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, by taking into account the prior probability and the witnesses' testimonies. Since our calculated probability (0.0993) is higher than the scenario where the witnesses' testimonies are independent of the attacker's height (0.06), we can consider this as evidence in favor of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. However, since the difference is not very large, our estimate should not be too far from the prior probability (0.15).

Therefore, as a rough estimate, we can calculate a weighted average of our calculated probability (0.0993) and the scenario where the witnesses' testimonies are independent of the attacker's height (0.06), using the prior probability (0.15) as the weight for the calculated probability:

Estimated probability = (0.15 \* 0.0993) / (0.15 \* 0.0993 + (1 - 0.15) \* 0.06) ≈ 0.57

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.57, given the available information.
