To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability of A given W1 is:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given the following information:

* P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W1), we need to consider the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Let B represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

* P(W1|B) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
* P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Using the law of total probability, we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|B) \* P(B)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.096 / 0.29
= 0.331

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.331.
