To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two pieces of information: the population distribution (information a) and the witness testimonies (information b). We can use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief based on the new evidence from the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:

P(H) = probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (our prior belief)
P(~H) = probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|H) = probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W1|~H) = probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W2|H) = probability of witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W2|~H) = probability of witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From information a, we have:
P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85

From information b, we have:
P(W1|H) = 0.80
P(W1|~H) = 0.20
P(W2|H) = 0.30
P(W2|~H) = 0.70

Now let's apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

First, let's calculate P(W1, W2|H) and P(W1, W2|~H):

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the desired probability:

P(H|W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] = 0.24 \* 0.15 / [0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85] = 0.168 / 0.266 â‰ˆ 0.6316
