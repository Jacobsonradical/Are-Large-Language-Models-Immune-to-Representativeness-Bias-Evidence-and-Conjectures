To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates, as well as the population distribution in the city.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Then:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information given, we know that:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate when the person's height is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (the percentage of the population in the city that is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (the percentage of the population in the city that is shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to find P(W1|~H), which is the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(W1|~H) = 0.2

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.385

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony and the population distribution, is approximately 0.385.
