To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of calculating conditional probabilities.

Let's denote:

* P(Tall) as the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which we know from information (b) is 0.15.
* P(Short) as the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.
* P(W1|Tall) as the probability that Witness 1 reports the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller. From information (a), we know this is 0.80.
* P(W1|Short) as the probability that Witness 1 reports the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), we know this is 0.20.
* P(W2|Tall) as the probability that Witness 2 reports the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller. From information (a), we know this is 0.30.
* P(W2|Short) as the probability that Witness 2 reports the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm, given that they are shorter than 185 cm. From information (a), we know this is 0.70.

We want to find P(Tall|W1), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 reported them as being 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate this as follows:

P(Tall|W1) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1|Short) \* P(Short)]

Substituting in the values we know, we get:

P(Tall|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the above expression, we get:

P(Tall|W1) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.357.
