To find an estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1). Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We also need P(W1), which we can find using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')

Where A' represents the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We are given:

P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we don't have P(W1|A'). Since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, we can assume that they err 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm as well. Therefore, P(W1|A') = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4137931034482759

{probability: 0.4137931034482759}
