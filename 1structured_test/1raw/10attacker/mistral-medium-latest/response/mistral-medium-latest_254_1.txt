To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).
P(F) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from information b).
P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are, which is 0.80 (from information a).
P(W1|F) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, which is 0.20 (from information a).

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 says they are. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|F) \* P(F)]

Substituting the values:

P(T|W1) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(T|W1) â‰ˆ 0.2813

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.2813.
