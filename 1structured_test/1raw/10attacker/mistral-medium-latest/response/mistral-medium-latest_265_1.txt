To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as H, and the event of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller as W1.

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given:

P(H) = 0.15 (as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (as the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We know P(W1|H) = 0.8 and P(H) = 0.15. We also need P(W1|not H) and P(not H).

P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

P(W1|not H) = 0.2 (as the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.24

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 ≈ 0.4583

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4583.
