To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given that P(H) = 0.15, since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. We are also given that P(W1|H) = 0.8, since the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person's height is 185 cm or taller.

To find P(W1), we need to consider both the possibility that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the possibility that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Let ~H represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and let ~W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Then:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)

Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is 185 cm or taller, they must be correct in 100% - 20% = 80% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(W1|~H) = 0.2, since the first witness incorrectly claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We are also given that P(~H) = 0.85, since 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1), we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, substituting the values for P(H), P(W1|H), and P(W1) into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
