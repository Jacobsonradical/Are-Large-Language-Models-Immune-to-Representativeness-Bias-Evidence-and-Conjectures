To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll consider the accuracy of Witness 1, as well as the base rate of individuals in the population who are 185 cm or taller. Here's the calculation:

1. Witness 1's accuracy: The witness correctly identifies individuals who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, the probability of the witness being correct when they claim someone is 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
2. Base rate: According to information (b), 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. Applying Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (P) that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = [P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 1 says so)

Here, P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Witness 1's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller = 0.8
P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Base rate = 0.15

We need to find P(Witness 1 says so) for the calculation. This is the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can happen in two cases: (a) when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and Witness 1 says so correctly, or (b) when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, but Witness 1 mistakenly claims they are 185 cm or taller.

P(Witness 1 says so) = P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Since Witness 1 errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, P(Witness 1 says so | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2. P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 1 - P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.85.

P(Witness 1 says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 says so) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

{probability: 0.4138}
