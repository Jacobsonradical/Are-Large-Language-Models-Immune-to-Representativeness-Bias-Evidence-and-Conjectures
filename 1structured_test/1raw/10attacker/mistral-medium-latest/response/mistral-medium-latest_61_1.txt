To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

1. H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
3. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b).
4. P(W1|H): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are, which is 0.8 (from information a).
5. P(W1|¬H): The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, which is 0.2 (from information a).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) ≈ 0.281

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.281.
