To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to find the prior probability of H, which is given by the information in (a): P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of W1 given H, which is the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given by the information in (b): P(W1|H) = 0.80.

We also need to find the likelihood of W1 given not H, which is the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 1 minus the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm if the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm: P(W1|not H) = 1 - P(not W1|not H) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of H given W1:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.278

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.278.
