To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find the probability P(A|B), which can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

From the information given, we know that:

* P(A) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
* P(not A) = 0.85
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is able to identify correctly 80% of the time)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 \* 0.70 + 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.42 (the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is actually taller than 185 cm, and 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm; therefore, the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14, and the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller is 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24; since these two events are mutually exclusive, we can add their probabilities to get the overall probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.42 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.249

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.249 or 24.9%.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.249}
