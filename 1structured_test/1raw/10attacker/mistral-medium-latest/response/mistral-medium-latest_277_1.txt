To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the base rate of people's heights in the city. We can use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively. We want to find P(A|W1).

First, we need to calculate the prior probability P(A). According to information (b), 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to calculate the likelihoods P(W1|A) and P(W1|¬A), which represent the probabilities of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is or is not 185 cm or taller, respectively. According to information (a), the first witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8. Since the witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.387

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.387.
