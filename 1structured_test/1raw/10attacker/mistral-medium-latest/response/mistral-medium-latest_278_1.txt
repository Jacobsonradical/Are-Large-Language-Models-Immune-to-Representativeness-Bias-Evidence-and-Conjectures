To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W1). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the problem statement, we know the following:

P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from information b)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We need to find P(W1|not H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.20 (since the witness errs in 20% of the cases).

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
