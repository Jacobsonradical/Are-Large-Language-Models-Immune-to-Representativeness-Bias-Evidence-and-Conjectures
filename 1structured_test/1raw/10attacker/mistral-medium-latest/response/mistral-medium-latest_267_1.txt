To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W1). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)

To calculate P(W1), we need to find the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall, which can happen in two ways: either the attacker is tall and the witness correctly identifies it, or the attacker is not tall and the witness incorrectly identifies it. Since the witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time and 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm (from a), the probability of the second case is 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.17. Therefore:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.17 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.225

Now we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1) ≈ (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.225 ≈ 0.5333

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.5333.
