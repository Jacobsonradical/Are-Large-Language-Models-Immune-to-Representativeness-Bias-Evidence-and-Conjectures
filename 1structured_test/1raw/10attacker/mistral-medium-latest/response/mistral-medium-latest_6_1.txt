To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence.

Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

From the information given, we can identify the following probabilities:

1. P(A): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Based on the population distribution in the city, this is 15%, or 0.15.
2. P(W1|A): The probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller, which is 80%, or 0.8.
3. P(W1): The probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, P(¬A) = 0.85.

Given that the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(W1|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
