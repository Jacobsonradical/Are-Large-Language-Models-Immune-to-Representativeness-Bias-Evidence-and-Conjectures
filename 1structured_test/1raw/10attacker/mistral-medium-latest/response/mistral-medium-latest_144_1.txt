To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem is a way to update our beliefs about the probability of an event occurring based on new evidence. In this case, the event is the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses.

First, let's define some variables:

* P(Tall) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the population statistics in the city.
* P(Short) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population statistics in the city.
* P(W1|Tall) is the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* P(W1|Short) is the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
* P(W2|Tall) is the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
* P(W2|Short) is the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we know that:

* P(Tall) = 0.15
* P(Short) = 0.85
* P(W1|Tall) = 0.80
* P(W1|Short) = 0.20
* P(W2|Tall) = 0.30
* P(W2|Short) = 0.70

We want to find P(Tall|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(Tall|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(W1, W2)

We can calculate P(W1, W2|Tall) as:

P(W1, W2|Tall) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(W2|Tall) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate P(W1, W2|Short) as:

P(W1, W2|Short) = P(W1|Short) \* P(W2|Short) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

The denominator in Bayes' theorem, P(W1, W2), can be calculated as:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1, W2|Short) \* P(Short)
= 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate P(Tall|W1, W2) as:

P(Tall|W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 = 0.2367 \* 0.9677 = 0.228

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 0.228.

Therefore, the answer is {probability: 0.228}.
