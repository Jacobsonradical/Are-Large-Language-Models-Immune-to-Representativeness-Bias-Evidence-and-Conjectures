To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is whether the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses (E1 and E2).

First, let's estimate the prior probability of H, which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller before considering any evidence. According to the information provided, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability of H is 0.15.

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. In other words, what is the probability of witness 1 testifying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller (L1|H), and what is the probability of witness 2 testifying that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm if the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller (L2|H)?

According to the information provided, witness 1 has an 80% chance of correctly identifying the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller, so L1|H = 0.8. Witness 2 has a 30% chance of incorrectly identifying the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller, so L2|H = 0.3.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of H given the evidence:

P(H|E1,E2) = [P(E1,E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1,E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1,E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since the testimony of the two witnesses is independent, we can rewrite the formula as:

P(H|E1,E2) = [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

To calculate the denominator, we need to find the probability of witness 1 testifying that the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm (L1|~H), and the probability of witness 2 testifying that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller (L2|~H).

According to the information provided, witness 1 has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm, so L1|~H = 0.2. Witness 2 has a 70% chance of correctly identifying the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm, so L2|~H = 0.7.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|E1,E2) = [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85]

Simplifying, we get:

P(H|E1,E2) â‰ˆ 0.27

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.27 or 27%.
