To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15 (from information a).
- P(S) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 0.85 (from information a).
- P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.80 (from information b).
- P(W1|S) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 0.20 (from information b).
- P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.30 (from information b).
- P(W2|S) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is given as 0.70 (from information b).

We want to find P(T|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1,W2|S) \* P(S)]

We can calculate P(W1,W2|T) and P(W1,W2|S) as follows:

P(W1,W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|S) = P(W1|S) \* P(W2|S) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(T|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.2059 / (0.2059 + 0.119) ≈ 0.63

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.63.
