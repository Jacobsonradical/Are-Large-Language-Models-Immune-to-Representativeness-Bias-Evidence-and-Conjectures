To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given, we have:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
* P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.3889
