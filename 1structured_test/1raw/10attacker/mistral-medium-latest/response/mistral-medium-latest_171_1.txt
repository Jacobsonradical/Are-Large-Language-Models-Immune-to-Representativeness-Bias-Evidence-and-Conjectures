To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is expressed as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, event A represents "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B represents "the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller." We want to find P(A|B).

First, let's find the prior probabilities:
P(A) = probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(not A) = probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from information b)

Next, let's find the likelihoods:
P(B|A) = probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (from information a)
P(B|not A) = probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (from information a)

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [(0.80 \* 0.15)] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.3855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3855.
