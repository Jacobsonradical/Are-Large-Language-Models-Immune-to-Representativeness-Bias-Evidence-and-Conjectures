To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given:

- P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
- P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)

We still need to find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events: the witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller and when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We know P(H) = 0.15, so P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85.

To find P(W1|¬H), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, we can use the information about the witness's errors:

P(W1|¬H) = 1 - P(correct identification when the person is shorter) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.12 / 0.375 ≈ 0.32

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.32.
