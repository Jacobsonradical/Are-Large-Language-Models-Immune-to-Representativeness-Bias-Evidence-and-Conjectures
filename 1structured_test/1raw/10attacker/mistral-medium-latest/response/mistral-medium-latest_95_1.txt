To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence (E) is the testimony of the first witness. The prior probability of the hypothesis (P(H)) can be estimated from the information in (b), which states that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(H) = 0.15.

The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis (P(E|H)) is the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. According to (a), the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time. Therefore, P(E|H) = 0.80.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

The denominator, P(E), is the probability of the evidence, which can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of the evidence given each possible hypothesis, weighted by the prior probabilities of the hypotheses. In this case, there are two possible hypotheses: the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H), or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (~H). The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(E|~H)) is the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to (a), the first witness errs in 20% of the cases. Therefore, P(E|~H) = 0.20 \* P(~H).

Since P(H) + P(~H) = 1, we can substitute P(~H) = 1 - P(H) and calculate P(E) as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Substituting the values of P(H), P(E|H), and P(E) into Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the hypothesis as follows:

P(H|E) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.096 / 0.29
= 0.331

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness and the prior probabilities, is approximately 0.331.
