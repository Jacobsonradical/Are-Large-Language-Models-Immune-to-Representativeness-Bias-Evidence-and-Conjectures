To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the reliability of the witnesses.

First, let's denote the probability of a random person in the city being 185 cm or taller as P(A), which is given as 0.15 (based on information "a").

Next, let's denote the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an individual's height as P(C|A) if the person is 185 cm or taller, and P(C|¬A) if the person is shorter than 185 cm. According to information "b", P(C|A) = 0.8 and P(C|¬A) = 0.2.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness:

P(A|C) = [P(C|A) \* P(A)] / [P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:

P(A|C) ≈ 0.346

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.346.

Answer: {probability: 0.346}
