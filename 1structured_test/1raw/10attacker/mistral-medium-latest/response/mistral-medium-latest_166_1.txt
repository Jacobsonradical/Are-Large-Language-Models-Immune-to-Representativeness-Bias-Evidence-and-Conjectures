To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims it is.

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

We are given:
P(W|H) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W|¬H) and P(¬H) to calculate P(W).
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the first witness's inaccuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W):
P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(H|W):
P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.414.
