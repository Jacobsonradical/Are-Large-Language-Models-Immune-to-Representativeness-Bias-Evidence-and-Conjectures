To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

From the information provided:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm, the probability of the witness claiming a person is tall given that they are actually short is:

P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 \* (0.85 / 0.5)

This adjustment is made because the witness is exposed to an uneven distribution of heights (85% short, 15% tall) in the general population, unlike in the sample used to assess their ability.

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85 \* 0.85 / 0.5)]
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.228

{probability: 0.228}
