To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W.

We want to find P(H|W), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Where:

* P(W|H) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80%.
* P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information given in (b), this probability is 15%.
* P(W|~H) is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. This probability is 1 - P(W|H'), where P(W|H') is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height when the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, P(W|H') is 80%, and P(W|~H) is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.
* P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From the information given in (b), this probability is 85%.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17]
P(H|W) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.4138}
