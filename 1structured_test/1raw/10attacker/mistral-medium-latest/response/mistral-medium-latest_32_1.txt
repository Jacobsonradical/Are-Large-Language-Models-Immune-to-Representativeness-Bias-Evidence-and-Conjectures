To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|W1). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the given information:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)

Now, we need to find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This probability is a combination of two cases: (1) the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies it, and (2) the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly claims they are 185 cm or taller.

P(W1) = P(W1 and H) + P(W1 and not H)
P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We know P(H) = 0.15, so P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85. We also know P(W1|H) = 0.80. Now we need P(W1|not H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness errs 20% of the time when identifying heights, P(W1|not H) = 0.20.

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
