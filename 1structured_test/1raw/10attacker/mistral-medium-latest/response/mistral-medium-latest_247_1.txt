To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

From the information given:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)

P(W1|A) = 0.80 (from b)

P(W1) = P(W1 and A) + P(W1 and not A) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|not A) \* P(not A)

Since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person's height is actually shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(W1|not A) = 0.20

Therefore, we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
