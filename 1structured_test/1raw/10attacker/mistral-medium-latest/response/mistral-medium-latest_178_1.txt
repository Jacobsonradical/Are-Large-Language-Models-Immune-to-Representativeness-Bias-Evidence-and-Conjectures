To determine the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. First, let's define our events:
   - H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - W1: Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - W2: Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

2. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims they are 185 cm or taller.

3. Using Bayes' theorem, we can express P(H|W1) as follows:
   - P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

4. From the information provided, we know that:
   - P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)
   - P(W1|H) = 0.80 (Witness 1 correctly identifies the height of a person 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
   - P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
   - P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the height of a person 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)

5. We need to find P(W1), the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We can express P(W1) as follows:
   - P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)
   - P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
   - P(W1) ≈ 0.21

6. Now we can find P(H|W1):
   - P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
   - P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.21
   - P(H|W1) ≈ 0.5714

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's claim, is approximately 0.5714.
