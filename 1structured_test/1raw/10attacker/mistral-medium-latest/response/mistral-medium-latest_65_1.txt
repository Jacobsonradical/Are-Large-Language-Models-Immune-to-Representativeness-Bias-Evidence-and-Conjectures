To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the witness testimonies.

1. First, let's consider the base rate probability from the population distribution (information "a"): 15% of people in the city are 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability is 0.15.
2. Next, we'll account for the witness testimonies (information "b"). We have two witnesses with different accuracy rates: Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time (P(W1) = 0.8) and Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time (P(W2) = 0.7).
3. Since the witnesses provide conflicting testimonies, we can't simply average their accuracy rates. Instead, we'll use Bayes' theorem to update our prior probability based on each witness's testimony.
4. For Witness 1, who claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the posterior probability is: P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)], where H represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and ~H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
5. Plugging in the values, we get: P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)].
6. Similarly, for Witness 2, who claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the posterior probability is: P(H|W2) = P(W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W2|~H) \* P(~H)].
7. Plugging in the values, we get: P(H|W2) = (0.2 \* 0.15) / [(0.2 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)].
8. Now, we need to combine the posterior probabilities from both witnesses. Since the witnesses are independent, we can use the product of the likelihood ratios: P(H|W1, W2) = P(H|W1) \* P(H|W2) / [P(H|W1) \* P(H|W2) + P(~H|W1) \* P(~H|W2)].
9. After calculating the posterior probabilities for each witness and plugging them into this equation, we find that P(H|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.13.
