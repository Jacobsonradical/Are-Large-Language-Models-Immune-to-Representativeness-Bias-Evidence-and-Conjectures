To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
A: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|A), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness made that claim.

First, let's find the prior probability P(H) based on the population distribution:
P(H) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's find the likelihood P(A|H) which is the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that it is true:
P(A|H) = 80% = 0.80

Now we need to find the probability of the witness making the claim regardless of the attacker's height P(A). To do this, we use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|not H) \* P(not H)

The probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that it is false (not H) can be calculated as:
P(A|not H) = 20% = 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

And P(not H) can be calculated as:
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(A):
P(A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(H|A):

P(H|A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) / P(A) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.413793

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
