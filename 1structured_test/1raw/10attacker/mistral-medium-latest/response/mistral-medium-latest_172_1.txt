To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a formula that helps us find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E). In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H), and the evidence is the testimony of the two witnesses (E1 and E2 respectively).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of H, which is the probability of H before considering any evidence. According to the information provided, the prior probability of H is 0.15 (15%).

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of each witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (L1|H and L2|H respectively). According to the information provided, the first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller, and the second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm. Since the witnesses are testifying against each other, we need to find the probability that the second witness would incorrectly identify the attacker's height if they are 185 cm or taller. This probability is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (30%).

Now, let's calculate the likelihood of each witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (L1|~H and L2|~H respectively). According to the information provided, the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm, and the second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm. Since the witnesses are testifying against each other, we need to find the probability that the first witness would incorrectly identify the attacker's height if they are shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 0.2 (20%).

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of H given E1 and E2:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values we calculated earlier:

P(H|E1, E2) = [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85]

Calculating the value:

P(H|E1, E2) = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.112) = 0.2381

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.2381.
