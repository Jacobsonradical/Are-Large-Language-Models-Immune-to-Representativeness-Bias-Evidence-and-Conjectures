{probability: 0.53}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution (information 'a'). According to the data, there is an 85% chance that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which means there is a 15% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Next, we need to consider the witness testimonies (information 'b'). The first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time, so the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is 0.80 \* 0.15 = 0.12. However, since the first witness also errs 20% of the time, there's a 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.17 chance that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter.
3. Similarly, the second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time, so there's a 0.70 \* 0.85 = 0.595 chance that the second witness accurately claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. However, since the second witness also errs 30% of the time, there's a 0.30 \* 0.15 = 0.045 chance that the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker is shorter when they are actually 185 cm or taller.
4. Since both witnesses cannot be correct, we need to weigh the probability that the first witness is correct against the probability that the first witness is incorrect due to the second witness's testimony. This means comparing the 0.12 probability (first witness is correct) to the product of the probabilities that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct (0.17 \* 0.595).
5. The ratio of these probabilities is 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17 \* 0.595) = 0.53.

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the provided information, is approximately 0.53.
