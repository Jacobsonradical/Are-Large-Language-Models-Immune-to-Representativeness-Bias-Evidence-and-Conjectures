To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

First, we can find the prior probability P(A) using the information in (a): P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find P(B|A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the information in (b), we know that the first witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so P(B|A) = 0.8.

We also need to find P(B|¬A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. From the information in (b), we know that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, so P(B|¬A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.357

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.357.
