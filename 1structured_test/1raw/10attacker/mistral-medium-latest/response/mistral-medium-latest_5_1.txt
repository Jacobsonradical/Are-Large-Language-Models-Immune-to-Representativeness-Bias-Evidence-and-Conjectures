To answer this question, we need to consider both the base rate of tall people in the population and the reliability of the witnesses. Bayes' theorem can be used to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness.

First, let's define some terms:

P(Tall) = probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
P(Short) = probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W1|Tall) = probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person = 0.80
P(W1|Short) = probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall = 0.20

We want to find P(Tall|W1), the probability that the attacker was tall given that Witness 1 identified them as tall.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall|W1) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1|Short) \* P(Short)]

Now we can plug in the values:

P(Tall|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:

P(Tall|W1) ≈ 0.3086 / (0.3086 + 0.17)
P(Tall|W1) ≈ 0.3086 / 0.4786
P(Tall|W1) ≈ 0.6445

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.6445.
