To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the reliability of the witnesses.

First, let's find the prior probability based on the population distribution (information a). Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability (P(H)) is 0.15.

Next, let's find the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height. We have two witnesses, W1 and W2, with different accuracy rates.

For witness W1 (80% accurate, 20% error):
Likelihood if the attacker is 185 cm or taller (L1|H) = 0.8 (since they are more likely to correctly identify a tall person)
Likelihood if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (L1|~H) = 0.2 (error rate)

For witness W2 (70% accurate, 30% error):
Likelihood if the attacker is 185 cm or taller (L2|H) = 0.3 (error rate)
Likelihood if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (L2|~H) = 0.7 (since they are more likely to correctly identify a short person)

Now, let's use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies:

P(H|W1, W2) = [P(H) \* L1|H \* L2|H] / [P(H) \* L1|H \* L2|H + P(~H) \* L1|~H \* L2|~H]

Plug the values:
P(H|W1, W2) = [(0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3)] / [(0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3) + (0.85 \* 0.2 \* 0.7)]

Calculate the result:
P(H|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.067

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.067.
