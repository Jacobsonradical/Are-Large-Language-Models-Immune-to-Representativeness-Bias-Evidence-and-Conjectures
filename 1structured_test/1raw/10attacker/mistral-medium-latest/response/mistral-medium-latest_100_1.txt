To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, our prior probability (before considering the witness testimony) is based on the population distribution in the city, and our likelihood is based on the accuracy of the witnesses.

Let's denote:

* P(T) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (our goal)
* P(S) as the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller (80%)
* P(W1|S) as the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (20%)
* P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm (30%)
* P(W2|S) as the probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm (70%)

From the information given, we have:

* P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of Witness 1 (P(T|W1)). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(T|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

After calculating the values, we get:

probability: 0.28125

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.28125.
