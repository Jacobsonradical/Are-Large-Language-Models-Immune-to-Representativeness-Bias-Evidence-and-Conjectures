To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (from information a)
P(~H) as the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|H) as the probability of Witness 1 identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller
P(W1|~H) as the probability of Witness 1 identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are shorter than 185 cm
P(W2|H) as the probability of Witness 2 identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller
P(W2|~H) as the probability of Witness 2 identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided:
P(H) = 0.15
P(~H) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80
P(W1|~H) = 0.20
P(W2|H) = 0.30
P(W2|~H) = 0.70

We want to find P(H|W1,W2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1,W2)

First, calculate P(W1,W2|H) and P(W1,W2|~H):

P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Next, find P(W1,W2):

P(W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H)
            = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85
            = 0.036 + 0.119
            = 0.155

Now, find P(H|W1,W2):

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1,W2)
                = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155
                ≈ 0.2316 \* 0.9677
                ≈ 0.2228

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2228, or 22.28%.
