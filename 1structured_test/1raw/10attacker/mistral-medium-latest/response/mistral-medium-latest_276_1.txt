To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the height being 185 cm or taller (from statement a) = 0.15
P(~H) as the prior probability of the height being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

P(E1|H) as the probability of the first witness correctly identifying a tall person = 0.80
P(E1|~H) as the probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying a short person as tall = 0.20

P(E2|H) as the probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying a tall person as short = 0.30
P(E2|~H) as the probability of the second witness correctly identifying a short person = 0.70

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

However, since the two witnesses' testimonies are independent events, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) / [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Now, plug in the values:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.14
