To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

From the given information, we know:

1. P(A) = 0.15 (probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
2. P(not A) = 0.85 (probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm)
3. P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability of the first witness correctly identifying a person as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller)
4. P(B|not A) = 0.20 (probability of the first witness incorrectly claiming a person is 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.385

{probability: 0.385}

Therefore, given the available information, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.385.
