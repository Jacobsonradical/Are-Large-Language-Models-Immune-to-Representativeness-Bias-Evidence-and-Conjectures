To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

First, let's find the prior probability P(H) from information a:
P(H) = 15% = 0.15

Next, let's find the likelihood of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller, P(W1|H), from information b:
P(W1|H) = 80% = 0.80

Now, let's find the likelihood of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller if the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, P(W1|H'):
P(W1|H') = 20% = 0.20

Since P(H') = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we can find P(W1) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|H') \* P(H')
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given witness 1's testimony:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
