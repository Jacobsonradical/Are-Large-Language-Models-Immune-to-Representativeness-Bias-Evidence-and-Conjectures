To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the testimony of the first witness as W1.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

We are given the following information:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (first witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.36

{probability: 0.36}
