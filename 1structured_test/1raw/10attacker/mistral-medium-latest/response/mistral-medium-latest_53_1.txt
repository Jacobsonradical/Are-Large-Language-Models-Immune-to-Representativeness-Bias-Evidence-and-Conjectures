To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the given information, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)

To find P(W1), we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is correct and the possibility that the witness is incorrect. We can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We can find P(W1|not H) using the information about the second witness. Since the two witnesses provide contradictory statements, we can assume that when the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(W1|not H) = 1 - P(correct identification by the second witness) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30.

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
= (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.255
= 0.375

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.375
= 0.09 / 0.375
= 0.240

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.240.
