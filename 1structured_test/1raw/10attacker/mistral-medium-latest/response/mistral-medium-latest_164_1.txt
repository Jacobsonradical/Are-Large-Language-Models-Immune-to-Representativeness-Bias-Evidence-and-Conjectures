To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, P(A|B) and P(B|A), using the formula:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In our case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller," and event B is "the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller."

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b: 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (100% - 15% = 85%)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.389

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.389.

The answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.389}
