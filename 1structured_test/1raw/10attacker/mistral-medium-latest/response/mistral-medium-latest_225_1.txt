To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given in part b, we know that P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

Since the first witness is 80% accurate when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(B|A) = 0.80.

To find P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the chance that they are correct and the chance that they are incorrect. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Since the first witness is 20% inaccurate when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(B|¬A) = 0.20.

Therefore, P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
