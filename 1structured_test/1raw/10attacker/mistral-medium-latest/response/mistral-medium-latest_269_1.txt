To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W2: The event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(H): The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population data (b)
* P(~H): The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 based on the population data (b)
* P(W1|H): The conditional probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy data (a)
* P(W1|~H): The conditional probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on the witness's accuracy data (a)
* P(W2|H): The conditional probability of the second witness claiming the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 based on the witness's accuracy data (a)
* P(W2|~H): The conditional probability of the second witness claiming the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 based on the witness's accuracy data (a)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

However, since we also have information from the second witness, we need to update our posterior probability using this new information.

Using Bayes' theorem again, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm:

P(H|W1,W2) = [P(W2|H) \* P(H|W1)] / [P(W2|H) \* P(H|W1) + P(W2|~H) \* P(~H|W1)]

Substituting the values we have calculated, we get:

P(H|W1,W2) = [0.3 \* P(H|W1)] / [0.3 \* P(H|W1) + 0.7 \* (1 - P(H|W1))]

We can solve for P(H|W1) using the equation we derived earlier:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.32

Substituting this value back into the equation for P(H|W1,W2), we get:

P(H|W1,W2) = [0.3 \* 0.32] / [0.3 \* 0.32 + 0.7 \* (1 - 0.32)] = 0.12

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided by both witnesses, is approximately 0.12 or 12%.
