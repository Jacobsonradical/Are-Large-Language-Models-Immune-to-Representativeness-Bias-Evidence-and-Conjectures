To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B). By Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given that P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.

We are also given that P(B|A) = 0.8, since the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.

To find P(B), we need to consider the possibility that the first witness could testify that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller even if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Specifically:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We are given that P(B|not A) = 0.2, since the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.

We can find P(not A) as follows:

P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(B), we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.38

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.38.
