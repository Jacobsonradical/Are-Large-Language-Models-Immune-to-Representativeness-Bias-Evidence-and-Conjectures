To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
P(F) as the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
P(W1|T) as the probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(W1|F) as the probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
P(W2|T) as the probability of Witness 2 saying the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
P(W2|F) as the probability of Witness 2 saying the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|T) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W1|F) = 0.20 (First witness errs 20% of the time)
P(W2|T) = 0.30 (Second witness errs 30% of the time)
P(W2|F) = 0.70 (Second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

Since both witnesses gave contradictory statements, we can't directly use Bayes' theorem on their individual testimonies. Instead, we can calculate the likelihood ratio (LR) of the evidence provided by both witnesses:

LR = P(Evidence|T) / P(Evidence|F)

In this case, the evidence is that one witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the other witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. So, we need to find the probability of this evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(Evidence|T)) and the probability of this evidence given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(Evidence|F)).

P(Evidence|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(Evidence|F) = P(W1|F) \* P(W2|F) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the likelihood ratio:

LR = P(Evidence|T) / P(Evidence|F) = 0.24 / 0.14 ≈ 1.71

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

P(T|Evidence) = [P(Evidence|T) \* P(T)] / [P(Evidence|T) \* P(T) + P(Evidence|F) \* P(F)]

P(T|Evidence) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.23
