To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: the first witness's testimony
P(H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information a)
P(~H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W1|H): the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that it is true = 0.8 (from information b)
P(W1|~H): the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that it is false = 0.2

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]

Calculating the expression:

P(H|W1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
