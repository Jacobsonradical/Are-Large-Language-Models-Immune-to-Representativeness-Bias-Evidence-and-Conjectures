To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the testimony of the first witness as W1. We want to calculate P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the given information:

1. P(H) = probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from statement b)
2. P(~H) = probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
3. P(W1|H) = probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person = 0.8 (from statement a)
4. P(W1|~H) = probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall = 0.2 (from statement a)

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4211

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4211.
