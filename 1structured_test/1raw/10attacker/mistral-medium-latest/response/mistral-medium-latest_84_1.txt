To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let A represent the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

We are given that:

* P(A) = 0.15, since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller
* P(not A) = 0.85, since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm
* P(B|A) = 0.80, since the first witness correctly identifies the height of people 185 cm or taller 80% of the time

We also need to find P(B|not A), the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can use the following formula:

P(B|not A) = 0.20 \* P(B|error)

We are not given the value of P(B|error), the probability of the first witness claiming that someone was 185 cm or taller when they have made an error. However, we can use the fact that the first witness errs equally often for people shorter or taller than 185 cm to estimate this probability.

Since half of the people in the sample used to assess the witness's ability were shorter than 185 cm, and the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, we can estimate that the first witness will claim that someone who is actually shorter than 185 cm is 185 cm or taller in 10% of the cases (i.e., 20% \* 0.5 = 10%). Therefore, we can estimate P(B|error) to be 0.10.

Using this value, we can calculate P(B|not A):

P(B|not A) = 0.20 \* 0.10 = 0.02

Now we can plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.02 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.64

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.64.
