To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness's claim is correct.
C: The second witness's claim is correct.

We're given the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from b)
P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (from b)
P(C|A) = 0.3 (from b)
P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (from b)

Since the witnesses' claims are contradictory, we know that exactly one of them is correct. Therefore, P(B) = 1 - P(C). However, we need to find P(A|B) to answer the question.

First, let's find P(B) using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
P(B) ≈ 0.18 + 0.17
P(B) ≈ 0.35

Now, let's find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.35
P(A|B) ≈ 0.12 / 0.35
P(A|B) ≈ 0.343

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.343.
