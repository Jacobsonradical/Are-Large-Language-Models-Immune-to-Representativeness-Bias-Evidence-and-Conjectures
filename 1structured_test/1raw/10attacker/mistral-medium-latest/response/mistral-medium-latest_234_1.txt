To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will consider two events: A represents the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and B represents the event that the first witness reported the attacker as 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

We have the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from information a, the first witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (from information a, the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from information b, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Substituting the values:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.3636

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3636.
