To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of evidence, a and b, and we want to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H) given the testimony of both witnesses (E1 and E2).

First, let's find the probability of each witness's testimony given the attacker's height.

For Witness 1 (W1):
P(E1|H) = 0.80 (the probability of W1 correctly identifying a tall person)
P(E1|¬H) = 0.20 (the probability of W1 incorrectly identifying a short person as tall)

For Witness 2 (W2):
P(E2|H) = 0.30 (the probability of W2 incorrectly identifying a tall person as short)
P(E2|¬H) = 0.70 (the probability of W2 correctly identifying a short person)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the height of the attacker, we can rewrite the equation as:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1|¬H) \* P(E2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Given the information in a, we know:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(H|E1, E2) = [(0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.70 \* 0.85))]

Probability = 0.036 / (0.036 + 0.112) = 0.2381

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2381.
