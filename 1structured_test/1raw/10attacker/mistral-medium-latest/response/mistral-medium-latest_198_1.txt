To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

First, we need to find P(A) and P(W1|A). From the information given, P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population) and P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population). Since the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, P(W1|A) = 0.8.

Next, we also need to find P(W1|~A). The first witness errs 20% of the time, so P(W1|~A) = 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|~A) \* P(~A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3855

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3855.
