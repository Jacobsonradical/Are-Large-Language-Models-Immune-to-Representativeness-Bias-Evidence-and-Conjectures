To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from information b, first witness's accuracy)

Since we don't have direct information about P(W1|¬H), we can calculate it using the probability of error provided for the first witness:

P(W1|¬H) = 1 - P(¬W1|¬H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.4545

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4545.
