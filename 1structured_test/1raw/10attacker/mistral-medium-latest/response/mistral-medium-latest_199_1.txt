To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of people's heights in the city and the witnesses' testimonies. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 and W2 represent the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively. We are interested in finding P(H|W1 ∩ W2), the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1 ∩ W2)

We can calculate each term on the right-hand side as follows:

1. P(W1 ∩ W2|H): The probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witnesses are independent, we have P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H). The first witness correctly identifies a tall person with a probability of 80%, so P(W1|H) = 0.8. The second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short with a probability of 30%, so P(W2|H) = 0.3. Therefore, P(W1 ∩ W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24.
2. P(H): The prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.
3. P(W1 ∩ W2): The probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies, regardless of the attacker's height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability: P(W1 ∩ W2) = P(W1 ∩ W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1 ∩ W2|¬H) \* P(¬H), where ¬H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We already calculated P(W1 ∩ W2|H) and P(H); we need to find P(W1 ∩ W2|¬H) and P(¬H). The prior probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm is 85%, so P(¬H) = 0.85. The first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall with a probability of 20%, and the second witness correctly identifies a short person with a probability of 70%, so P(W1 ∩ W2|¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14. Therefore, P(W1 ∩ W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.131.

Now we can calculate P(H|W1 ∩ W2):

P(H|W1 ∩ W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / 0.131 ≈ 0.282

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.282.
