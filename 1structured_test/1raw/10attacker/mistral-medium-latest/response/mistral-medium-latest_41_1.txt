To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information provided, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)
P(W1|not H) = 0.20 (since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases)

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.375

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.375.
