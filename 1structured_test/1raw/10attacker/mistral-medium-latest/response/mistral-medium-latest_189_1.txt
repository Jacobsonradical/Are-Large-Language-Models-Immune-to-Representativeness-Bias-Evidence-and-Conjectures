To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. We have prior probabilities and conditional probabilities from the given information.

1. Prior probabilities (from part b):
   - P(Height ≤ 185 cm) = 0.85
   - P(Height > 185 cm) = 0.15

2. Conditional probabilities (from part a):
   - P(Witness 1 says "Tall" | Height > 185 cm) = 0.80 (True positive rate)
   - P(Witness 1 says "Tall" | Height ≤ 185 cm) = 0.20 (False positive rate)
   - P(Witness 2 says "Not tall" | Height > 185 cm) = 0.30 (False negative rate)

Since both witnesses gave contradictory statements, we will only consider the first witness's statement for now.

3. Applying Bayes' theorem:
   - P(Height > 185 cm | Witness 1 says "Tall") = [P(Witness 1 says "Tall" | Height > 185 cm) \* P(Height > 185 cm)] / P(Witness 1 says "Tall")

4. Calculating the denominator:
   - P(Witness 1 says "Tall") = P(Witness 1 says "Tall" | Height > 185 cm) \* P(Height > 185 cm) + P(Witness 1 says "Tall" | Height ≤ 185 cm) \* P(Height ≤ 185 cm)
   - P(Witness 1 says "Tall") = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

5. Calculating the posterior probability:
   - P(Height > 185 cm | Witness 1 says "Tall") = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

However, this estimation does not consider the contradiction with the second witness. To incorporate that information, we need to calculate the likelihood of both witnesses giving contradictory statements given the attacker's height. Then, we can update our probability using this new likelihood.

In this case, we would need to know the true negative rate (the ability of the second witness to correctly identify someone shorter than 185 cm) to perform this calculation. Unfortunately, that information is not provided.

Without this additional information, we cannot accurately estimate the posterior probability considering both witnesses' statements. However, based on the first witness's statement only, the estimated probability is approximately 0.4138.
