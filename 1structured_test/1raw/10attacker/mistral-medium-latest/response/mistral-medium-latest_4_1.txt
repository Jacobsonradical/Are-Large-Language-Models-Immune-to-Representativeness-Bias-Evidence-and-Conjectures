To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, we first need to calculate the prior probability and the likelihood ratio based on the given information.

The prior probability (P(H)) of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city is 15%, as mentioned in point b.

The likelihood ratio (LR) can be calculated based on the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates provided in point a. The likelihood ratio is the ratio of the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (true positive rate) to the probability of the witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (false positive rate).

For the first witness, the true positive rate is 80% (correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller), and the false positive rate is the probability of claiming someone is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter, which is 20% (error rate when the person is shorter). However, since the first witness is claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to calculate the false positive rate based on the prior probability of being shorter. Therefore, the false positive rate is 20% \* (1 - 0.15) = 0.17 or 17%.

So, the likelihood ratio for the first witness (LR1) is 0.8 / 0.17 ≈ 4.706.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E1)) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

P(H|E1) = (P(H) \* LR1) / (P(H) \* LR1 + P(~H))

Since P(H) = 0.15 and P(~H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85, we have:

P(H|E1) = (0.15 \* 4.706) / (0.15 \* 4.706 + 0.85) ≈ 0.272 or 27.2%

Finally, the desired probability is:
{probability: 0.272}
