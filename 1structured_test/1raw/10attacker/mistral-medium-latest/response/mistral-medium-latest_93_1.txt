To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information provided:

P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now, let's calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3784

{probability: 0.3784}
