To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

First, let's find the prior probability P(H) using the information given in 'a':
P(H) = 15% = 0.15

Now, we need to find the likelihoods P(W1|H) and P(W2|H^c), where H^c is the complementary event (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

According to the information in 'b', the first witness correctly identifies the height of someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time:
P(W1|H) = 80% = 0.8

Since the second witness incorrectly identifies the height of someone 185 cm or taller 30% of the time, their correct identification rate for someone shorter than 185 cm is:
1 - 0.3 = 0.7

However, we need the likelihood that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed not 185 cm or taller (H^c). Since the second witness is presented with only one person, this likelihood is simply their correct identification rate for someone shorter than 185 cm:
P(W2|H^c) = 0.7

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the desired probability:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|H^c) \* P(H^c)]

Since W1 and W2 are independent events, we have:

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Similarly,

P(W1, W2|H^c) = P(W1|H^c) \* P(W2|H^c) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can compute the desired probability:

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.291

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.291.
