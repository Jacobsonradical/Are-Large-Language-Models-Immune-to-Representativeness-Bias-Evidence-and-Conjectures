To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 be the events that the first and second witnesses, respectively, claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A^c) \* P(A^c)]

where P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(A^c) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that P(A) = 0.15 and P(A^c) = 0.85.

We are also given that the first witness has a probability of 0.8 of correctly identifying the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller, and a probability of 0.2 of incorrectly identifying the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm. Therefore, P(W1|A) = 0.8 and P(W1|A^c) = 0.2.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.4167

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4167 or 41.67%.
