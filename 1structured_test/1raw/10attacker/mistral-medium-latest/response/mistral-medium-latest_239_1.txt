To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability, which is the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies. Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E)

where:

- H is the hypothesis (the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- E is the evidence (the witness testimonies)
- P(H|E) is the posterior probability
- P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
- P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
- P(E) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence

First, we need to calculate the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis. Since there are two witnesses, we can multiply the two probabilities:

P(E|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H)

where:

- P(W1|H) is the probability that Witness 1 would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller
- P(W2|H) is the probability that Witness 2 would testify that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller

From the information given, we know that:

- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (since Witness 1 is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time)
- P(W2|H) = 0 (since Witness 2 claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm)

Therefore:

P(E|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0 = 0

However, we cannot use a likelihood of 0 in Bayes' theorem because it would result in a posterior probability of 0, regardless of the prior probability or the marginal likelihood. This is known as the zero likelihood problem. To overcome this problem, we can use a small positive value instead of 0, such as 0.001. This will not significantly affect the results, but it will allow us to calculate the posterior probability.

Therefore, we assume that:

P(W2|H) = 0.001

and:

P(E|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.001 = 0.0008

Next, we need to calculate the prior probability of the hypothesis, which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller before considering the evidence. From the information given, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Finally, we need to calculate the marginal likelihood of the evidence, which is the probability of the evidence given all possible hypotheses. Since there are only two hypotheses (the attacker was shorter than 185 cm or the attacker was 185 cm or taller), we can calculate the marginal likelihood as follows:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H)

where:

- P(E|~H) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm
- P(~H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the information given, we know that:

- P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate P(E|~H), we need to consider the likelihood of the witness testimonies given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Since Witness 1 errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that Witness 1 would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm is 0.2. Similarly, since Witness 2 errs in 30% of the cases, the probability that Witness 2 would testify that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is 0.3. Therefore, the probability that Witness 2 would testify that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

Therefore:

P(E|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

and:

P(E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|~H) \* P(~H) = 0.0008 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.119

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability as follows:

P(H|E) = P(E|H) \* P(H) / P(E) = (0.0008 \* 0.15) / 0.119 = 0.000924

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.000924}
