To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, A and B, and is given by:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]

In this case, event A corresponds to the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and event B corresponds to the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We are interested in finding P(A|B).

From the information given, we know the following probabilities:

P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
P(B|A) = 0.80 (from b, first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|not A) = 0.20 (from b, first witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)]
= [(0.80) \* (0.15)] / [(0.80) \* (0.15) + (0.20) \* (0.85)]
= 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17)
= 0.36 / 0.53
= 0.679245283
