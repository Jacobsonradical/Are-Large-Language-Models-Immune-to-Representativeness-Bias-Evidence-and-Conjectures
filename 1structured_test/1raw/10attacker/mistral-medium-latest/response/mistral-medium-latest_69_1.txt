{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, let's consider the information in statement a, which provides the baseline probability of a randomly selected person from the city being 185 cm or taller as 15% (or 0.15) and shorter than 185 cm as 85% (or 0.85).
2. Next, let's consider the testimony of the two witnesses and their accuracy rates. The first witness is correct 80% of the time (0.8) and incorrect 20% of the time (0.2), and the second witness is correct 70% of the time (0.7) and incorrect 30% of the time (0.3).
3. To calculate the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior probability of an event is proportional to the prior probability of the event multiplied by the likelihood of the observed evidence given that event.
4. The prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 0.15. The likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.8 (since the witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller).
5. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) * P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 testimony)

Since we don't have the prior probability of the first witness's testimony (P(Witness 1 testimony)), we can't calculate the posterior probability directly. However, we can make an estimate by assuming that the prior probability of the first witness's testimony is equal to the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller or shorter than 185 cm, weighted by the witness's accuracy rates.

Under this assumption, the prior probability of the first witness's testimony is:

P(Witness 1 testimony) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.24

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.24 = 0.5

6. Next, we need to consider the testimony of the second witness. The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 0.85. The likelihood of the second witness's testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.7 (since the witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm).
7. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the second witness's testimony as follows:

P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2 testimony) = P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) / P(Witness 2 testimony)

Under the same assumption as before, the prior probability of the second witness's testimony is:

P(Witness 2 testimony) = 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.615

Now we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm given the second witness's testimony as follows:

P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 2 testimony) = (0.7 \* 0.85) / 0.615 = 0.963

8. Finally, we can estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller by taking the weighted average of the posterior probabilities calculated in steps 5 and 7, weighted by the witnesses' accuracy rates.
9. The weighted average can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8 \* 0.5 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.963) = 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.56.
