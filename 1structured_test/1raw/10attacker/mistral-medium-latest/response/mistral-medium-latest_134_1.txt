To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the general population distribution and the reliability of the witnesses.

Let's denote:

P(H\_tall) as the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller in the city, which is given as 0.15.

P(W1|H\_tall) as the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is indeed tall, which is 0.80.

P(W1|H\_short) as the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is short, which is 0.20.

P(W2|H\_tall) as the probability of Witness 2 claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is indeed tall, which is 0.70.

P(W2|H\_short) as the probability of Witness 2 claiming the attacker is tall given that the attacker is short, which is 0.30.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the probability that the attacker is tall given Witness 1's claim:

P(H\_tall|W1) = P(W1|H\_tall) \* P(H\_tall) / [P(W1|H\_tall) \* P(H\_tall) + P(W1|H\_short) \* P(H\_short)]

Now we need to update this probability with the information from Witness 2. Since Witness 2 claims the attacker was short, we want to find the probability that the attacker is tall given both witnesses disagree:

P(H\_tall|W1, W2\_disagree) = P(H\_tall|W1) \* P(W2\_disagree|H\_tall, W1) / [P(H\_tall|W1) \* P(W2\_disagree|H\_tall, W1) + P(H\_short|W1) \* P(W2\_disagree|H\_short, W1)]

Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 are independent, we can say:

P(W2\_disagree|H\_tall, W1) = P(W2|H\_tall) \* P(W2|H\_short)

And:

P(W2\_disagree|H\_short, W1) = P(W2|H\_short) \* P(W2|H\_tall)

Now we can substitute these probabilities into the equation above and calculate the final probability:

P(H\_tall|W1, W2\_disagree) ≈ 0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3 / [(0.15 \* 0.8 \* 0.3) + (0.85 \* 0.2 \* 0.7)] ≈ 0.112

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.112.
