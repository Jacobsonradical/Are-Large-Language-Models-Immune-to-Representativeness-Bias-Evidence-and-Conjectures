To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. However, since we have two witnesses with conflicting testimonies, we can calculate the likelihood of each witness being correct and then average the two probabilities weighted by their individual accuracies.

First, let's denote the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller as P(H), which is 0.15 based on the population distribution given in (a).

Next, let's denote the probability of the first witness correctly identifying an attacker's height as P(C1|H) and incorrectly identifying an attacker's height as P(C1|¬H). Based on the information given in (b), P(C1|H) = 0.8 and P(C1|¬H) = 0.2.

Similarly, let's denote the probability of the second witness correctly identifying an attacker's height as P(C2|H) and incorrectly identifying an attacker's height as P(C2|¬H). Based on the information given in (b), P(C2|H) = 0.7 and P(C2|¬H) = 0.3.

Now, using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness as follows:

P(H|C1) = [P(C1|H) \* P(H)] / [P(C1|H) \* P(H) + P(C1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H|C1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|C1) ≈ 0.2581

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the second witness as follows:

P(H|C2) = [P(C2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(C2|H) \* P(H) + P(C2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H|C2) = (0.7 \* 0.15) / [(0.7 \* 0.15) + (0.3 \* 0.85)]
P(H|C2) ≈ 0.1613

Finally, we can average the two probabilities weighted by their individual accuracies as follows:

P(H|C1, C2) = [(0.8 \* P(H|C1)) + (0.7 \* P(H|C2))] / (0.8 + 0.7)
P(H|C1, C2) ≈ [(0.8 \* 0.2581) + (0.7 \* 0.1613)] / 1.5
P(H|C1, C2) ≈ 0.2126

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2126.
