To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the witness's testimony as W1 (for the first witness) and W2 (for the second witness).

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the given information:

1. P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time when they are 185 cm or taller)
4. P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person's height 20% of the time when they are shorter than 185 cm)

Now let's calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.298

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.298.

Your answer: {probability: 0.298}
