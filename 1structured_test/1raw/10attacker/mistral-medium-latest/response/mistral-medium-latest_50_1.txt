To calculate the estimate, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
A: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(H|A). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) / P(A)

Now we need to find P(A|H), P(H), and P(A).

From information (a), P(A|H) = 0.8 (first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)

From information (b), P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(A), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A) = P(A|H) \* P(H) + P(A|H') \* P(H')

Since H' is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, P(H') = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

From information (a), P(A|H') = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the height is actually shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can calculate P(A):

P(A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|A):

P(H|A) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4138.
