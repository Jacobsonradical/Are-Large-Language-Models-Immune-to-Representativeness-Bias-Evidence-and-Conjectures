To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which we want to find)
P(S) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W1|S) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W2|S) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided, we have:
P(W1|T) = 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|S) = 0.2 (first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
P(W2|T) = 0.3 (second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)
P(W2|S) = 0.7 (second witness correctly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We also know that P(T) + P(S) = 1, and from the population distribution given, P(T) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85.

However, we cannot directly use Bayes' theorem in this case because the testimonies of the two witnesses are not independent, since they are both witnessing the same event. Instead, we can try to estimate the probability that both witnesses would give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and then compare it to the probability that both witnesses would give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) \* P(W2|S) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses:

P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) \* P(S)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(T|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.218

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.218.
