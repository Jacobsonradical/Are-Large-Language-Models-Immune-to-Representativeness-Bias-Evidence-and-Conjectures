To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

* P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution (b)
* P(E1|H) as the likelihood that the first witness reports "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller
* P(E1|~H) as the likelihood that the first witness reports "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(E2|H) and P(E2|~H) as the corresponding likelihoods for the second witness

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(H|E1, E2) = [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|~H) \* P(~H)]

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(H) = 0.15 (from the population distribution)
* P(E1|H) = 0.8 (from the first witness's accuracy rate)
* P(E1|~H) = 0.2 (from the first witness's error rate)
* P(E2|H) = 0.3 (from the second witness's error rate)
* P(E2|~H) = 0.7 (from the second witness's accuracy rate)

We can calculate the joint likelihoods as follows:

* P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
* P(E1, E2|~H) = P(E1|~H) \* P(E2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E1, E2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] = 0.24 / (0.24 + 0.119) = 0.67

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.67.
