To find an estimate for the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

First, we find P(H) using the given population distribution: P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we calculate P(W1 | H), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that it is true. Given that the first witness is correct 80% of the time, P(W1 | H) = 0.8.

Now we need to find P(W1 | ¬H), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that it is false. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time, P(W1 | ¬H) = 0.2.

We also need P(¬H), the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. From the population distribution, P(¬H) = 0.85.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) \* P(H) / [P(W1 | H) \* P(H) + P(W1 | ¬H) \* P(¬H)]
P(H | W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H | W1) ≈ 0.385
