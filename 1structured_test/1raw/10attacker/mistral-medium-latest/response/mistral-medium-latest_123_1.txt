To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
P(H): The prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|H): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W1|¬H): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2 (from information a)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:
P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3855

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3855.
