To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the population distribution and the reliability of the witnesses. Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we can only rely on the information provided by the witnesses.

Here are the facts:
a) 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
b) Witness 1 correctly identifies the height with 80% accuracy and errs 20% of the time.
c) Witness 2 correctly identifies the height with 70% accuracy and errs 30% of the time.

First, let's calculate the prior probability based on the population distribution:
P(taller) = 15% = 0.15
P(shorter) = 85% = 0.85

Next, let's calculate the likelihood of witness statements given the true height:
L(W1|taller) = 0.80
L(W1|shorter) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
L(W2|taller) = 0.20
L(W2|shorter) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30

Now, using Bayes' theorem, let's calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness statements:

P(taller|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|taller) \* P(taller)] / [P(W1, W2|taller) \* P(taller) + P(W1, W2|shorter) \* P(shorter)]

Since the witness statements are independent, we can rewrite the joint likelihood as:
L(W1, W2|taller) = L(W1|taller) \* L(W2|taller)
L(W1, W2|shorter) = L(W1|shorter) \* L(W2|shorter)

Plugging in the values:
L(W1, W2|taller) = 0.80 \* 0.20 = 0.16
L(W1, W2|shorter) = 0.20 \* 0.30 = 0.06

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:
P(taller|W1, W2) = (0.16 \* 0.15) / [(0.16 \* 0.15) + (0.06 \* 0.85)] = 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.051) = 0.18 / 0.231 â‰ˆ 0.78

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.78.
