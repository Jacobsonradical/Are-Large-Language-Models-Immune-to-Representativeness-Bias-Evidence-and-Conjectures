To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability (P(A|B)) can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event A) given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (event B). We can rewrite Bayes' theorem as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

We are given the following information:

* P(B|A) = probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time)
* P(¬B|¬A) = probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.8 (first witness erred in 20% of the cases)
* P(A) = probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)
* P(¬A) = probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Since we are interested in the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to find P(¬B|A) and P(B|¬A). We can calculate these probabilities using the following formula:

P(¬B|A) = 1 - P(B|A) = 0.2
P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can plug these probabilities into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
P(A|B) = [0.8 \* 0.15] / [0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(A|B) ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it to be so, is approximately 0.4138.
