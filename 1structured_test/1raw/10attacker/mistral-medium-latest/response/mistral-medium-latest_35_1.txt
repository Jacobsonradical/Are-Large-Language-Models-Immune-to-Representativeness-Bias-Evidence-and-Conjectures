To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, which according to information (b) is 0.15.

P(F) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the city, which according to information (b) is 0.85.

P(W1|T) as the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to information (a), this is 0.80.

P(W1|F) as the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. According to information (a), this is 0.20.

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that witness 1 claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|F) \* P(F)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(T|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / [0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85]

Calculating the expression, we get:

P(T|W1) â‰ˆ 0.281

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.281.
