To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. Since the witnesses are not perfectly reliable, we will use Bayes' theorem to incorporate their testimony into our estimate.

Let's denote:
P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(~T) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are
P(W1|~T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not
P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are
P(W2|~T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not

We know from the problem statement that:
P(T) = 0.15
P(~T) = 0.85
P(W1|T) = 0.8
P(W1|~T) = 0.2
P(W2|T) = 0.3
P(W2|~T) = 0.7

We want to find P(T|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) / P(W1, W2)

First, let's find P(W1, W2|T):
P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = (0.8) \* (0.3) = 0.24

Now, let's find P(W1, W2|~T):
P(W1, W2|~T) = P(W1|~T) \* P(W2|~T) = (0.2) \* (0.7) = 0.14

Next, we need to find P(W1, W2):
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1, W2|~T) \* P(~T) = (0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85) = 0.141

Finally, we can find P(T|W1, W2):
P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) / P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / 0.141 = 0.2482271844660194

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.248.
