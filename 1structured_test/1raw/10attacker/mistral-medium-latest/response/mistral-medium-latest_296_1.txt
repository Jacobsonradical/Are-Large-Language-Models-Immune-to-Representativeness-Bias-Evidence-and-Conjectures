To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

According to Bayes' theorem, P(A|B) can be calculated as follows:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

where:

* P(B|A) is the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80% or 0.8 in the problem statement.
* P(A) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller, we can take P(A) to be 0.15.
* P(B) is the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as follows:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A)

Since P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) and P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A), we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* (1 - P(A))

Now we need to find P(B|not A), which is the probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm, we can take P(B|not A) to be 0.2.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
