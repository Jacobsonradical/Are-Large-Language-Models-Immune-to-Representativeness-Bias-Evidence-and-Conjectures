To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we have:

P(H) = 0.15 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, so 15% are 185 cm or taller)

The first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller with probability 0.8, so:

P(W1|H) = 0.8

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|H^c) \* P(H^c)

where H^c represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, the probability that the first witness claims that a person shorter than 185 cm is 185 cm or taller is:

P(W1|H^c) = 0.2

The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:

P(H^c) = 0.85

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1), we get:

P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.24

Finally, we can find P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.24 = 0.4167

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4167.
