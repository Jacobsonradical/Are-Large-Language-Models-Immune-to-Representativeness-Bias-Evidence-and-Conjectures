To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem for this.

Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness testified that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified to that.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies heights 80% of the time)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies heights 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.397

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.397 or 39.7%.
