{probability: 0.56}

Here's the reasoning behind this estimate:

1. First, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, based on the information given in point a. Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm and 15% are 185 cm or taller, the prior probability (P(A)) is 0.15.
2. Next, we need to consider the witness testimony and their accuracy rates. The first witness correctly identifies a person's height 80% of the time (P(B|A)) and errs 20% of the time (P(B|¬A)) when the person is 185 cm or taller. The second witness correctly identifies a person's height 70% of the time (P(C|¬A)) and errs 30% of the time (P(C|A)) when the person is shorter than 185 cm.
3. We can now use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses. P(A|B,C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / [P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A)]
4. Plug in the values: P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.7 \* 0.85)]
5. Calculate the probability: P(A|B,C) ≈ 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.56.
