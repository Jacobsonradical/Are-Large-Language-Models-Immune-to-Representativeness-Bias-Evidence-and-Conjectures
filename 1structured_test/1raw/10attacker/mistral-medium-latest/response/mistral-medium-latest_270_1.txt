To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will denote the event of the attacker being 185 cm or taller as A, and the witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as W.

First, we need to find the prior probability P(A). From the information given, we know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods P(W|A) and P(W|¬A), which represent the probabilities of the witness's claim given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the probability of the witness's claim given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

From the information given, we know that the first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, so P(W|A) = 0.8. We also know that the first witness errs in 20% of the cases when the person is shorter than 185 cm, so P(W|¬A) = 0.2.

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(A|W):

P(A|W) = P(W|A) \* P(A) / [P(W|A) \* P(A) + P(W|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Simplifying the expression, we get:

P(A|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.17] ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is: {probability: 0.4138}
