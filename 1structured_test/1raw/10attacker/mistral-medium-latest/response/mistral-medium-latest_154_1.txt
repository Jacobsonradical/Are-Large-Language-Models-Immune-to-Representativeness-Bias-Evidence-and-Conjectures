To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witnesses' testimonies and the base rate of people's heights in the city. Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

First, let's denote:
P(Tall) = probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from information b)
P(Short) = probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
P(W1|Tall) = probability of witness 1 testifying "tall" given the attacker is tall = 0.8 (from information a)
P(W1|Short) = probability of witness 1 testifying "tall" given the attacker is short = 0.2 (from information a)

We want to find P(Tall|W1), the probability that the attacker is tall given witness 1 testified "tall."

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(Tall|W1) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1|Short) \* P(Short)]

Now, let's plug in the values:
P(Tall|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values:
P(Tall|W1) = (0.12) / [(0.12) + (0.17)]
P(Tall|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29
P(Tall|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4138

However, this estimate only considers the first witness's testimony. To incorporate the second witness's testimony, we could ask for their reported height and update our estimate using another application of Bayes' theorem. Unfortunately, the question does not provide the second witness's reported height. Therefore, I can only give an estimate based on the first witness's testimony.
