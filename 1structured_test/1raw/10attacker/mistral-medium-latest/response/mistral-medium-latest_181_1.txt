To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

First, let's calculate the weighted probabilities based on the witness testimonies:

Witness 1:
- The probability of correctly identifying a tall person (185 cm or taller) is 80%.
- The probability of mistakenly identifying a short person as tall is 20%.

Witness 2:
- The probability of correctly identifying a short person (shorter than 185 cm) is 70%.
- The probability of mistakenly identifying a tall person as short is 30%.

Since the victim could not see the attacker's height, we don't know whether the attacker is actually tall or short. Therefore, we need to consider the population distribution to estimate the prior probabilities:

- The probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15% (according to information b).
- The probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85%.

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness:

P(Tall | Witness 1 testimony) = [P(Witness 1 testimony | Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(Witness 1 testimony | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness 1 testimony | Not tall) \* P(Not tall)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Tall | Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the result:

P(Tall | Witness 1 testimony) â‰ˆ 0.283

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.283.

{probability: 0.283}
