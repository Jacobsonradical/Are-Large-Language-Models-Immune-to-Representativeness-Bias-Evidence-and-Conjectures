To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: Event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
A: Event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: Event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|A, B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|A, B) = P(A|H, B) \* P(H) / [P(A|H, B) \* P(H) + P(A|~H, B) \* P(~H)]

First, let's calculate P(H) and P(~H) from the information given in (a):

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate P(A|H, B) and P(A|~H, B):

Since the first witness's accuracy is 80%, the probability of them saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they actually are is:

P(A|H, B) = P(A|H) = 0.8

Similarly, the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter is:

P(A|~H, B) = P(A|~H) = 0.2

Now, we can calculate P(H|A, B):

P(H|A, B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.385

{probability: 0.385}
