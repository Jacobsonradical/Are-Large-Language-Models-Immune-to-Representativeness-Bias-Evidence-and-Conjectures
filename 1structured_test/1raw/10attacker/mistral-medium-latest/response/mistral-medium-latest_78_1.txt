To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15 based on information a)
P(~T) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85 based on information a)
P(W1|T) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 based on information b)
P(W1|~T) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2 based on information b)
P(W2|T) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter (which is 0.3 based on information b)
P(W2|~T) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.7 based on information b)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, denoted as P(T|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|~T) \* P(~T)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(T|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:
P(T|W1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17) = 0.12 / 0.29 = 0.4138

However, we also need to take into account the testimony of the second witness, who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We can denote this as P(~T|W2). Using Bayes' theorem again, we have:

P(~T|W2) = P(W2|~T) \* P(~T) / [P(W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W2|~T) \* P(~T)]

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(~T|W2) = (0.7 \* 0.85) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the values, we get:
P(~T|W2) = 0.6 / (0.045 + 0.6) = 0.6 / 0.645 = 0.9302

Since the two witnesses gave conflicting testimonies, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller taking into account both testimonies by multiplying the two probabilities:

P(T) = P(T|W1) \* P(~T|W2)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(T) = 0.4138 \* 0.0698 = 0.0289

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.0289}
