To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

From the information given, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(~H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (since the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.357

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, is approximately 0.357.
