To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We can calculate P(W1) as follows:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given that:

* P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(A|W1) as follows:

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
