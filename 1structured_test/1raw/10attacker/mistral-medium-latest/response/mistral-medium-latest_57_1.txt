To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to take into account both the base rate of people's heights in the city and the reliability of the witnesses' testimony.

First, let's consider the base rate of people's heights in the city. According to the information provided, 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the testimony of the two witnesses. The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases. Therefore, the likelihood that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.8. The likelihood that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2.

The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time, and erred in 30% of the cases. Therefore, the likelihood that the second witness would testify that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.3. The likelihood that the second witness would testify that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker was actually shorter than 185 cm, is 0.7.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(Tall | Testimony) = P(Testimony | Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(Testimony | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Testimony | Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)]

where:

* P(Tall | Testimony) is the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses.
* P(Testimony | Tall) is the likelihood of the testimony, given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* P(Tall) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* P(Testimony | Not Tall) is the likelihood of the testimony, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* P(Not Tall) is the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate P(Testimony | Tall) as follows:

P(Testimony | Tall) = P(W1 says Tall and W2 says Not Tall | Tall)

Since the two witnesses' testimony are independent, we can multiply the likelihoods of each witness's testimony:

P(Testimony | Tall) = P(W1 says Tall | Tall) \* P(W2 says Not Tall | Tall)

= 0.8 \* 0.3

= 0.24

We can calculate P(Testimony | Not Tall) as follows:

P(Testimony | Not Tall) = P(W1 says Tall and W2 says Not Tall | Not Tall)

= P(W1 says Tall | Not Tall) \* P(W2 says Not Tall | Not Tall)

= 0.2 \* 0.7

= 0.14

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(Tall | Testimony) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]

= 0.036 / [0.036 + 0.119]

= 0.036 / 0.155

= 0.232

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
