To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from b)
P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

To find P(W1|not H), we can use the second witness's accuracy rate. Let W2 represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Then:

P(W2|not H) = 0.70 (from b)
P(W1|not H) = 1 - P(W2|not H) = 0.30

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.30 \* (1 - 0.15)
= 0.12 + 0.255
= 0.375

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.375
= 0.316

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.316}
