To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem. The formula for Bayes' theorem is:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

In this case:

Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Event B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (from the second piece of information: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Now we need to calculate P(B). However, we do not have P(B|¬A) directly. Instead, we have information about the second witness who errs 30% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm. We can use the complementary probability to find P(B|¬A):

P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30

Now we can find P(B):

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and ¬A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85

P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.375 ≈ 0.32

{probability: 0.32}
