{probability: 0.52}

Here's the reasoning:

1. First, we need to consider the prior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution provided in statement a. We know that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability (P(H)) is 0.15.
2. Next, we need to consider the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height. For the first witness, who correctly identifies heights 80% of the time, the likelihood of their testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(W1|H) = 0.8. For the second witness, who correctly identifies heights 70% of the time, the likelihood of their testimony given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(W2|¬H) = 0.7.
3. To find the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem: P(H|W1,W2) = [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|¬H) \* P(¬H)]
4. The likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.2 = 0.16, since the second witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter.
5. The likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is P(W1,W2|¬H) = P(W1|¬H) \* P(W2|¬H) = 0.3 \* 0.7 = 0.21, since the first witness has a 30% chance of incorrectly identifying someone who is shorter than 185 cm as taller.
6. Now we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem: P(H|W1,W2) = (0.16 \* 0.15) / [(0.16 \* 0.15) + (0.21 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.52.

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.52.
