To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem states that the posterior probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) is proportional to the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis multiplied by the prior probability of the hypothesis.

In this case, the hypothesis H is that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence E is the testimony of the first witness. The prior probability of H is the proportion of people in the population who are 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15. The likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis is the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This probability is 80% or 0.8.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of H given E as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller (i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is the probability that the first witness would testify that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This probability is 20% or 0.2. The prior probability of the attacker not being 185 cm or taller is 85% or 0.85.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

P(H|E) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)

P(H|E) = 0.12 / 0.29

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.

Note that this estimate does not take into account the testimony of the second witness, which could potentially be used to refine the estimate further. However, based on the information provided, this is the best estimate we can make using Bayes' theorem.
