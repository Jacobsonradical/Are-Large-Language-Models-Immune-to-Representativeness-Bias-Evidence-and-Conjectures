To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- P(Tall) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (before considering witness testimonies)
- P(Short) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- P(W1|Tall) as the probability that Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller
- P(W1|Short) as the probability that Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller" given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm
- P(W2|Tall) and P(W2|Short) similarly for Witness 2

From information (b), we know that P(Tall) = 0.15 and P(Short) = 0.85. From information (a), we know that P(W1|Tall) = 0.80, P(W1|Short) = 0.20, P(W2|Tall) = 0.30, and P(W2|Short) = 0.70.

Since only one witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we are interested in P(Tall|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller". By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(Tall|W1) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(W1)

We need to calculate P(W1), the probability that Witness 1 says "185 cm or taller". Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 provide contradictory testimonies, we can treat the two witnesses as independent events. Thus:

P(W1) = P(W1 and not W2) = P(W1) \* P(not W2) = P(W1) \* P(W2|Short) \* P(Short) + P(W1) \* P(W2|Tall) \* P(Tall)

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.85 + 0.80 \* 0.30 \* 0.15 = 0.544

Now we can calculate P(Tall|W1):

P(Tall|W1) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) / P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.544 â‰ˆ 0.2165

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2165.
