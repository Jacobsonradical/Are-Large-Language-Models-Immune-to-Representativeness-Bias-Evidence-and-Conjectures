To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* E2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|E1, E2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) / P(E1, E2)

We can compute P(H) from the information given in (a): P(H) = 0.15

To compute P(E1, E2|H), we need to find the probability that both witnesses give their testimonies given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Since the witnesses are independent of each other, we have:

P(E1, E2|H) = P(E1|H) \* P(E2|H)

From the information given in (b), we have:

* P(E1|H) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(E2|H) = 0.20 (since the second witness incorrectly identifies tall people 20% of the time)

So, P(E1, E2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.20 = 0.16

To compute P(E1, E2), we can use the law of total probability:

P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H) + P(E1, E2|not H) \* P(not H)

Since the witnesses are independent of each other, we have:

P(E1, E2|not H) = P(E1|not H) \* P(E2|not H)

From the information given in (b), we have:

* P(E1|not H) = 0.20 (since the first witness incorrectly identifies short people 20% of the time)
* P(E2|not H) = 0.70 (since the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

So, P(E1, E2|not H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Therefore, P(E1, E2) = 0.16 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.032

Finally, we can find P(H|E1, E2):

P(H|E1, E2) = (P(E1, E2|H) \* P(H)) / P(E1, E2) = (0.16 \* 0.15) / 0.032 = 0.75

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is 0.75.
