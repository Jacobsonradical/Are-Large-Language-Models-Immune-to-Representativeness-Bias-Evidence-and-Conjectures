To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's determine the prior probability (P(H)) and the likelihood (P(E|H)).

P(H) is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15%.

P(E|H) is the probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This probability is given as 80%.

Now, we need to consider the alternative hypothesis, that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The probability of this is 85%, and the probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 20%.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability (P(H|E)):

P(H|E) = [P(H) \* P(E|H)] / [P(H) \* P(E|H) + P(~H) \* P(E|~H)]

Plugging in our values:

P(H|E) = [0.15 \* 0.8] / [0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2]

Calculating the result:

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.357 or 35.7%

However, this calculation only takes into account the testimony of the first witness. To incorporate the information from the second witness, we can use a similar approach, considering their testimony as a separate piece of evidence (E2).

First, let's calculate the probability of witness 2 claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(E2|H)):

P(E2|H) = 1 - P(E|H) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2

Next, we can update our posterior probability using Bayes' theorem again, considering both witness testimonies:

P(H|E, E2) = [P(H|E) \* P(E2|H)] / [P(H|E) \* P(E2|H) + P(~H|E) \* P(E2|~H)]

Since witness 2 is more likely to make errors, their testimony will lower the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. However, without knowing the exact value of P(~H|E) (the updated probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, given witness 1's testimony), we cannot calculate P(H|E, E2) directly.

Nonetheless, based on the information provided, we can estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, to be approximately 0.357 or 35.7%, considering only witness 1's testimony. When witness 2's testimony is taken into account, this probability will likely decrease, but we cannot provide an exact number without further calculations.
