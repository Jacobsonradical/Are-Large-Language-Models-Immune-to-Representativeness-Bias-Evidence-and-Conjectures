To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the population statistics (information a) and the witness testimonies (information b).

First, let's consider the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population statistics. According to information a, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so the prior probability is 0.15.

Next, let's consider the testimony of the first witness. Given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, we can calculate the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as 0.8.

However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness's testimony is incorrect. Since the witness correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 80% of the time when they are actually shorter than 185 cm, we can calculate the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm as 0.8 \* 0.85 (the probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm) + 0.2 \* 0.15 (the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller) \* 0.2 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height) = 0.71.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 1 testimony)

We have already calculated P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8. We can calculate P(Witness 1 testimony) as follows:

P(Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.28

Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.28 = 0.429

However, we also need to consider the testimony of the second witness. Given that the witness correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, we can calculate the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm as 0.7.

Similarly, the likelihood of the witness's testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.3 \* 0.15 (the probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller) + 0.7 \* 0.85 (the probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm) \* 0.3 (the probability of the witness incorrectly identifying the height) = 0.595.

We can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the second witness using Bayes' theorem:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 testimony) = P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Witness 2 testimony)

We have already calculated P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3. We can calculate P(Witness 2 testimony) as follows:

P(Witness 2 testimony) = P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.3 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.605

Therefore, the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the second witness is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 testimony) = 0.3 \* 0.15 / 0.605 = 0.074

Finally, we can combine the testimonies of the two witnesses using Bayes' theorem to calculate the overall posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Both witnesses) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) / P(Both witnesses)

We have already calculated P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 and P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8. We can calculate P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) as follows:

P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) / P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony)
= 0.3 \* 0.429 / 0.15 = 0.858

We can calculate P(Both witnesses) as follows:

P(Both witnesses) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm) \* P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is shorter than 185 cm | Witness 1 testimony) \* P(Attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
= 0.8 \* 0.858 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* (1 - 0.71) \* 0.85 = 0.199

Therefore, the overall posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses is:

P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Both witnesses) = 0.8 \* 0.858 \* 0.15 / 0.199 = 0.406

Therefore, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.406}.
