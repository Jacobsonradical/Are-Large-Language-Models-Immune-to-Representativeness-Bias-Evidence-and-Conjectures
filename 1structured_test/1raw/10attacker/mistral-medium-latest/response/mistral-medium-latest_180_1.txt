To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, in this case, the event that the witness's testimony is correct (A) and the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (B).

Let's denote:

P(A|B) as the probability that the witness's testimony is correct, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is equal to 0.8.

P(B|A) as the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the witness's testimony is correct.

P(B) as the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is equal to 0.15 based on the population distribution.

P(A) as the prior probability that the witness's testimony is correct, which can be calculated as P(A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|B') \* P(B'), where B' denotes the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, and P(A|B') is the probability that the witness's testimony is correct, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know that P(B') = 1 - P(B) = 0.85, and that P(A|B') = 1 - P(E|B') = 0.7, where P(E|B') is the probability that the witness's testimony is incorrect, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Therefore, P(A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) + P(A|B') \* P(B') = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.7 \* 0.85 = 0.755.

Now we can calculate P(B|A) using Bayes' theorem:

P(B|A) = P(A|B) \* P(B) / P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.755 â‰ˆ 0.1723

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.1723 or 17.23%.
