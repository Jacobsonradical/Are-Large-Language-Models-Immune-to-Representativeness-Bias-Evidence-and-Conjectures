To find the estimate of the probability, we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Tall) \* P(Tall) / (P(Witness 1 | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(Witness 1 | Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall))

Given the information, we know that:

P(Tall) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(Not Tall) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(Witness 1 | Tall) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(Witness 1 | Not Tall) = 0.20 (First witness incorrectly identifies a not-tall person as tall 20% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability:

P(Tall | Witness 1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)) â‰ˆ 0.3855

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3855.
