To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in finding P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

From the information provided, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8:

P(W1|H) = 0.8

The first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is not 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.2:

P(W1|¬H) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.3571

{probability: 0.3571}
