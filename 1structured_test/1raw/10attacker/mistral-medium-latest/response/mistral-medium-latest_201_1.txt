To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional probabilities of two events. Here, the two events are:

* Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: Witness 1 claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability of event A given event B, written as P(A|B). Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller)
* P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution)

To find P(B), we need to calculate the probability of event B happening, regardless of the true height of the attacker. We can do this by considering two possible cases:

1. The attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller (event A), and Witness 1 correctly identifies the height (event B). The probability of this case is P(B and A) = P(B|A) \* P(A) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12.
2. The attacker's height is actually shorter than 185 cm (event not A), but Witness 1 incorrectly claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (event B). The probability of this case is P(B and not A) = P(B|not A) \* P(not A) = 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.17.

The probability of event B happening is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:

P(B) = P(B and A) + P(B and not A) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of Witness 1, is approximately 0.4138.
