To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

We are given the following information:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness was able to identify the correct height 80% of the time when the person was 185 cm or taller)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(W1), the probability that the first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

where ¬A represents the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Since the second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we know that P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness erred in 20% of the cases when the person was shorter than 185 cm). We are also given that P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.4138

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
