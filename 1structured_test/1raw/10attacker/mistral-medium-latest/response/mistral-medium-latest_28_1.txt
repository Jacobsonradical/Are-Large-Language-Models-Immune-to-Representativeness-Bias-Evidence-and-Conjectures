To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W1: The event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: The event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H | W1, W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

First, let's use the base rate information from (a) to find the prior probability P(H). Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihoods P(W1 | H) and P(W1 | ¬H) for Witness 1, and P(W2 | H) and P(W2 | ¬H) for Witness 2. We are given that:

P(W1 | H) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
P(W1 | ¬H) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
P(W2 | H) = 0.3 (the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time)
P(W2 | ¬H) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H | W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \* P(H) / [P(W1, W2 | H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2 | ¬H) \* P(¬H)]

First, find P(W1, W2 | H):
P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \* P(W2 | H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Next, find P(W1, W2 | ¬H):
P(W1, W2 | ¬H) = P(W1 | ¬H) \* P(W2 | ¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Finally, substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(H | W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.296
