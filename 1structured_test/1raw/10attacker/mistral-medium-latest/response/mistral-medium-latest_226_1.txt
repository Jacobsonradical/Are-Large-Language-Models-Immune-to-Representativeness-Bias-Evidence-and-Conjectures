To find the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

First, we need to find P(A) and P(W1|A):

P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)

Next, we need to find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')

We know P(A) = 0.15, and we need to find P(A'), P(W1|A'), and P(W1|A):

P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|A') = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|A') \* P(A')
= 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
= 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
= 0.12 / 0.29
