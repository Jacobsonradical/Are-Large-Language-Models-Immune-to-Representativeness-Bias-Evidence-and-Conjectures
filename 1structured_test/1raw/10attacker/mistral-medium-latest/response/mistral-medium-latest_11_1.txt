To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

From the information provided, we know that:

P(W1|A) = 0.8 (since the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W1|¬A) and P(¬A) in order to calculate P(W1). ¬A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(W1|¬A) = 0.2 (since the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.522.
