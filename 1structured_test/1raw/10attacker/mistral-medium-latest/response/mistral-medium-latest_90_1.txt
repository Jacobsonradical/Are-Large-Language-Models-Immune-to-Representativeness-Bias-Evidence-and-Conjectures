To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information a.

P(B|A) as the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to information b, this is 0.8.

P(B|¬A) as the probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the false positive rate, which is 0.2.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(A|B) ≈ 0.256 or 25.6%

However, this estimate does not take into account the testimony of the second witness. To incorporate their testimony, we can use the same approach as before, but with updated prior probabilities based on the first witness's testimony.

Let's denote:

P'(A) as the updated prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's testimony. This is equal to our previous estimate, P(A|B) ≈ 0.256.

P'(B|A) as the probability that the second witness would say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is the false negative rate, which is 1 - 0.7 = 0.3.

P'(B|¬A) as the probability that the second witness would say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.7.

Now we can use Bayes' theorem again to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the second witness said so:

P'(A|B) = [P'(B|A) \* P'(A)] / [P'(B|A) \* P'(A) + P'(B|¬A) \* P'(¬A)]

Plugging in the values:

P'(A|B) = (0.3 \* 0.256) / [(0.3 \* 0.256) + (0.7 \* 0.744)]

P'(A|B) ≈ 0.101 or 10.1%

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 10.1%.
