To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate (information a) and the witness testimonies (information b). We can use Bayes' theorem for this.

Let's denote:

- P(H) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.15 according to information a)
- P(~H) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.85)
- P(W1|H) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller (which is 0.8 according to information b)
- P(W1|~H) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller (which is 0.2)
- P(W2|H) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.3)
- P(W2|~H) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm (which is 0.7)

We are interested in finding P(H|W1, W2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

First, let's find P(W1, W2|H):

Since the witnesses are independent, we can write:

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Next, let's find P(W1, W2|~H):

Again, since the witnesses are independent, we can write:

P(W1, W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(H|W1, W2):

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.2353

So the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.2353}
