To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(A) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from statement a).
P(B) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from statement a).
P(W1|A) as the probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from statement b).
P(W1|B) as the probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from statement b).
P(W2|A) as the probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 (from statement b).
P(W2|B) as the probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 (from statement b).

We want to find P(A|W1,W2), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|A) \* P(A) / [P(W1,W2|A) \* P(A) + P(W1,W2|B) \* P(B)]

To calculate P(W1,W2|A) and P(W1,W2|B), we need to find the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given the height of the attacker. Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we have:

P(W1,W2|A) = P(W1|A) \* P(W2|A) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|B) = P(W1|B) \* P(W2|B) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1,W2) ≈ 0.201 / (0.201 + 0.119)
P(A|W1,W2) ≈ 0.201 / 0.32
P(A|W1,W2) ≈ 0.628

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.628.
