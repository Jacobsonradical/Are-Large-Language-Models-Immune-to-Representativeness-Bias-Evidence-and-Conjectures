To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem can be written as:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) \* P(A)] / [P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

In this case, event A is "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and event B is "the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller". We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims that it is.

From the information provided, we know the following probabilities:

* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
* P(B|¬A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|B) ≈ 0.36

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.36.
