To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H | W1).

By Bayes' theorem, P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) \* P(H) / [P(W1 | H) \* P(H) + P(W1 | not H) \* P(not H)]

From the information given, we know that:
P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not H) = 0.85
P(W1 | H) = 0.80 (since the first witness is 80% accurate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1 | not H) = 0.20 (since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:
P(H | W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.385

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.385.
