To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

Using Bayes' theorem, let's calculate the posterior probability P(H|W1), where H is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 is the first witness's testimony that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]

Here, P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population distribution. P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W1|H) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the witness's accuracy. P(W1|~H) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2 based on the witness's inaccuracy.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.384

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.384.
