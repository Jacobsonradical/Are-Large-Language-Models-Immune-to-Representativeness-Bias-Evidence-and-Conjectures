To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" as A, and the event "the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" as B. We want to find P(A|B).

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

First, let's find P(B|A). This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. So, P(B|A) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(A). This is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From the information provided, 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller. So, P(A) = 0.15.

Now, let's find P(B). This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. We can find this probability using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)

Where ¬A denotes the event "the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm". From the information provided, the first witness incorrectly claims that a person's height is 185 cm or taller 20% of the time for people who are shorter than 185 cm. So, P(B|¬A) = 0.2. Also, the probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, so P(¬A) = 0.85.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.41

{probability: 0.41}
