To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we have:

P(W1|H) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time.)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.)

We also need to find P(W1|¬H) and P(¬H). Since there are only two possible height categories, we can use the following facts:

P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.2 (The first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time.)

Now we can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)
         = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
              = 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
              = 0.12 / 0.29
              = 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
