To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem for this. Let's first define some events:

A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
B: Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
C: Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B,C), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies. According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B,C) = P(B|A,C) \* P(A) / P(B|C)

Since witness 1 and witness 2 provide independent testimonies, we have:

P(B|A,C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) = P(B|A) \* (1 - P(B|A))

Now we need to find the probabilities P(B|A) and P(B|A'). We are given that:

- P(B|A) = 0.8 (first witness identifies correctly when the person's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (first witness errs when the person's height is shorter than 185 cm)

Also, we are given the population distribution:

- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A') = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now we can calculate P(B|C):

P(B|C) = P(B|A,C) \* P(A) + P(B|A',C) \* P(A')

Since witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, we need to find P(B|A',C) which is the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller when witness 2 claims the opposite. Since witness testimonies are independent, we have:

P(B|A',C) = P(B|A')

Now we can calculate P(B|C):

P(B|C) = P(B|A,C) \* P(A) + P(B|A',C) \* P(A')
P(B|C) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|A') \* P(A')
P(B|C) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B,C):

P(A|B,C) = P(B|A,C) \* P(A) / P(B|C)
P(A|B,C) = P(B|A) \* P(C|A) \* P(A) / P(B|C)
P(A|B,C) = (0.8 \* (1 - 0.8) \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.2783
