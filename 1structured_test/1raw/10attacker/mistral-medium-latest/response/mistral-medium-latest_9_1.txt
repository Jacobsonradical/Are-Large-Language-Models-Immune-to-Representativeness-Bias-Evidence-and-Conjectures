To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to calculate conditional probabilities. Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
* W2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
* P(H): the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information b.

We want to find the probability P(H|W1), which is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

where ¬H denotes the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and P(¬H) = 0.85.

From information a, we know that the first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller, so P(W1|H) = 0.80. Similarly, the first witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller, so P(W1|¬H) = 0.20.

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] = 0.40

Therefore, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is 0.40 or 40%.
