To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

According to Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

From the problem statement, we know:

P(W|H) = 0.8 (the first witness is 80% accurate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to find P(W|¬H) and P(¬H). Since the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we can assume that the first witness's claim is the only information available for the event W. Therefore:

P(W|¬H) = 0.2 (the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W):

P(H|W) = (P(W|H) \* P(H)) / P(W)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.4138
