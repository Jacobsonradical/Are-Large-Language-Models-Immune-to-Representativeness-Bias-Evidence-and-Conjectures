To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
W1: The event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(H|W1). According to Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from statement b, since the first witness accurately identifies tall people 80% of the time)

However, we still need to find P(W1). To do this, we need to consider both the possibility that the witness is testifying about a tall person (H) and a short person (H'). We are given:

P(H') = 0.85 (from statement a)
P(W1|H') = 0.20 (from statement b, since the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

We can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|H') \* P(H')
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W1) = 0.29

Now we can compute P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (P(W1|H) \* P(H)) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4138
