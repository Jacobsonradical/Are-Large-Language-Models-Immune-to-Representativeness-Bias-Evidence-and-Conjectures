To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (H1) given the testimony of the first witness (W1).

Let's denote the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm as H2. We are given the following prior probabilities:

P(H1) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(H2) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We are also given the following conditional probabilities:

P(W1|H1) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(W1|H2) = 0.20 (First witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the first witness:

P(H1|W1) = [P(W1|H1) \* P(H1)] / [P(W1|H1) \* P(H1) + P(W1|H2) \* P(H2)]

Substituting the given values:

P(H1|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the probability:

P(H1|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3571

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3571 or 35.71%.

The answer in the requested format is: {probability: 0.3571}
