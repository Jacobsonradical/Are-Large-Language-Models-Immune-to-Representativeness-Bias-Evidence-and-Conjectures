To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on information b.

P(~H) as the prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 based on information b.

P(W1|H) as the probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on information a.

P(W1|~H) as the probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 based on information a.

P(W2|H) as the probability of witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 based on information a.

P(W2|~H) as the probability of witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7 based on information a.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1,W2)

where P(W1,W2|H) is the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and P(W1,W2) is the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did.

Since witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we have:

P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:

P(W1,W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Then, the probability of both witnesses testifying as they did is:

P(W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1,W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.2243

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2243.
