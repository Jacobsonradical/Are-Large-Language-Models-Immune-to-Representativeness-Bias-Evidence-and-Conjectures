To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (information a)
P(~H) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (information a)

P(W1|H) as the likelihood that witness 1 identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 (information b)
P(W1|~H) as the likelihood that witness 1 identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 (information b)

P(W2|H) as the likelihood that witness 2 identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30 (information b)
P(W2|~H) as the likelihood that witness 2 identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70 (information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses:

P(H|W1,W2) = [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

We can calculate the likelihoods of the joint testimony of the two witnesses as follows:

P(W1,W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|W1,W2) = [0.24 \* 0.15] / [0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85] = 0.19 / (0.19 + 0.12) = 0.19 / 0.31 = 0.6129

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is estimated to be 0.6129.
