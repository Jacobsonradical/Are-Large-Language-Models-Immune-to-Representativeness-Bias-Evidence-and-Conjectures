To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution.

First, let's calculate the probability of the witnesses' testimonies given the attacker's height. For the first witness:

P(Testimony1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.8 (since they correctly identify tall people 80% of the time)

P(Testimony1 | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.2 (since they incorrectly identify short people as tall 20% of the time)

Similarly, for the second witness:

P(Testimony2 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.3 (since they incorrectly identify tall people as short 30% of the time)

P(Testimony2 | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.7 (since they correctly identify short people 70% of the time)

Next, let's consider the prior probabilities based on the population distribution:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.15

P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.85

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Testimony1 ∩ Testimony2) = (P(Testimony1 ∩ Testimony2 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) \* P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm)) / P(Testimony1 ∩ Testimony2)

However, since the witnesses' testimonies are contradictory, the intersection of their testimonies (Testimony1 ∩ Testimony2) is an empty set, meaning it has a probability of 0. Therefore, we cannot directly apply Bayes' theorem in this case.

Instead, we can calculate the likelihood ratio of the first witness's testimony, which represents the support for the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

Likelihood Ratio = P(Testimony1 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Testimony1 | Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.8 / 0.2 = 4

This means that the first witness's testimony is 4 times more likely if the attacker is 185 cm or taller than if the attacker is shorter. However, we need to consider the conflicting testimony of the second witness as well.

Since the second witness's testimony contradicts the first witness's testimony, we can calculate the likelihood ratio in a similar way:

Likelihood Ratio = P(Testimony2 | Attacker < 185 cm) / P(Testimony2 | Attacker ≥ 185 cm) = 0.7 / 0.3 ≈ 2.33

This means that the second witness's testimony is about 2.33 times more likely if the attacker is shorter than if the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To combine these likelihood ratios, we can take their product:

Combined Likelihood Ratio = 4 \* 2.33 ≈ 9.32

This means that, considering both witnesses' testimonies, the evidence is about 9.32 times more likely if the attacker is 185 cm or taller than if the attacker is shorter. However, we still need to consider the prior probabilities based on the population distribution.

To do this, we can calculate the posterior odds, which is the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

Posterior Odds = Combined Likelihood Ratio \* Prior Odds

where Prior Odds = P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm) / P(Attacker < 185 cm) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.18

So, the posterior odds are:

Posterior Odds ≈ 9.32 \* 0.18 ≈ 1.68

Finally, we can convert the posterior odds to a probability:

P(Attacker ≥ 185 cm | Testimony1 ∩ Testimony2) = Posterior Odds / (1 + Posterior Odds) ≈ 1.68 / (1 + 1.68) ≈ 0.63

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.63.
