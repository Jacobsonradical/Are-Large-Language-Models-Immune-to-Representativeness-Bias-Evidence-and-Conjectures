To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the testimony of the witnesses and the base rate of people's heights in the city.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the witness's testimony. Let's denote this probability as P(H|W), where H represents the height (185 cm or taller) and W represents the witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|~H) \* P(~H)]

Here, P(W|H) is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker truly is 185 cm or taller. According to the information provided, this is 80%.

P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution in the city. This is 15%.

P(W|~H) is the probability that the witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness makes errors 20% of the time, this probability is 20% \* P(attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 20% \* 85% = 17%.

P(~H) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population distribution in the city. This is 85%.

Plugging in these values, we get:

P(H|W) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.17 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W) = 0.12 / [0.12 + 0.1445]
P(H|W) â‰ˆ 0.4545

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4545.
