To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, our prior knowledge is the proportion of people in the city who are 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15), and our new evidence is the testimony of the first witness.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W. We want to find the probability P(H|W), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W)

where P(W|H) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, P(H) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and P(W) is the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height.

We are given that P(W|H) = 0.8, P(H) = 0.15, and we can compute P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|not H) \* P(not H)

where P(not H) is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller, which is equal to 1 - P(H) = 0.85. We are also given that the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, which means that the probability that the witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller is 0.2. Therefore, we have:

P(W|not H) = 0.2

Plugging these values into the equation for P(W), we get:

P(W) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) ≈ 0.245

Finally, we can compute P(H|W) as follows:

P(H|W) = (0.8)(0.15) / 0.245 ≈ 0.4898

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.49 or 49%.
