To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we need to find the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)). According to information "a", 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(H) = 0.15.

Next, we need to find the likelihood of each witness's testimony given the attacker's height. Let's denote the first witness's testimony as W1 and the second witness's testimony as W2. We have two scenarios:

1. The attacker is 185 cm or taller (H):
   - Likelihood of the first witness's testimony: P(W1|H) = 0.8 (since they correctly identify tall people 80% of the time)
   - Likelihood of the second witness's testimony: P(W2|H) = 0.2 (since they incorrectly identify tall people 20% of the time)

2. The attacker is shorter than 185 cm (~H):
   - Likelihood of the first witness's testimony: P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (since they incorrectly identify short people 20% of the time)
   - Likelihood of the second witness's testimony: P(W2|~H) = 0.7 (since they correctly identify short people 70% of the time)

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

P(H|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Since W1 and W2 are independent, we can rewrite the term inside the brackets as:

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H)
P(W1, W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1, W2) = [(0.8 \* 0.2) \* 0.15] / [(0.8 \* 0.2) \* 0.15 + (0.2 \* 0.7) \* 0.85]

Calculating the result:
