To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this probability.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses testify so, respectively. We want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A)]

From the information given:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬A) = 0.85
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

Now, we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.3636

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.3636.
