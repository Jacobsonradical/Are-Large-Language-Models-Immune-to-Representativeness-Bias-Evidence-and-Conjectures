To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H) and the probability of the witness being correct (C).
2. Calculate the prior probability P(H) based on the information in (a): P(H) = 0.15
3. Calculate the likelihood of the witness being correct given the attacker's height. For the first witness, we have:

P(C|H) = probability of witness being correct given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
P(C|not H) = probability of witness being correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time)

4. Calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem: P(H|C) = [P(C|H) \* P(H)] / [P(C|H) \* P(H) + P(C|not H) \* P(not H)]

P(H|C) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.32.
