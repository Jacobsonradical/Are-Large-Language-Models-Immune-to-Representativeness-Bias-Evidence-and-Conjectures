To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (as the first witness is able to identify correctly 80% of the time)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We need to find P(W1|not H). Since the first witness errs 20% of the time, the probability of them mistakenly claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter is:

P(W1|not H) = 0.20

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
