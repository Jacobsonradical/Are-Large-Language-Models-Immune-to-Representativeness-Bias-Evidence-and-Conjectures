To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(Tall) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population distribution (point b).

P(Short) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 based on the population distribution.

P(W1|Tall) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person, which is 0.8 based on their accuracy (point a).

P(W1|Short) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall, which is 0.2 based on their error rate (point a).

P(W2|Tall) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short, which is 0.3 based on their error rate (point a).

P(W2|Short) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short person, which is 0.7 based on their accuracy (point a).

We want to find P(Tall|W1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall|W1) = [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1|Short) \* P(Short)]

Now, we can calculate the probability:

P(Tall|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(Tall|W1) â‰ˆ 0.318 or 31.8%

However, since there is conflicting evidence from the second witness, we might want to take their testimony into account as well. One way to do this is to calculate the probability that both witnesses would give their respective testimonies given that the attacker was tall:

P(W1 and W2|Tall) = P(W1|Tall) \* P(W2|Tall) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Since the witnesses' testimonies are conflicting, it is less likely that both testimonies would be observed if the attacker was tall. However, without more information on how to incorporate this conflicting evidence, it is difficult to provide a more accurate probability estimate.

Based on the information provided, our best estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is approximately 0.318 or 31.8%. However, this estimate does not take into account the conflicting testimony of the second witness.
