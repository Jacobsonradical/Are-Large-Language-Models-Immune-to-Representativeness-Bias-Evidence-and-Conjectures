To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / (P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|¬A) \* P(¬A))

From the given information, we have:
P(A) = 0.15 (from a)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from a)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (from b)
P(W1|¬A) = 0.20 (since the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, we can plug these values into Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / ((0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)) ≈ 0.385

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.385.
