To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know:

P(H) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W1|H) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability, which states:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Where ¬H represents the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We know:

P(¬H) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to find P(W1|¬H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given that the attacker is actually short. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, we have:

P(W1|¬H) = 0.20

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)
= 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
≈ 0.38

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was, is approximately 0.38.
