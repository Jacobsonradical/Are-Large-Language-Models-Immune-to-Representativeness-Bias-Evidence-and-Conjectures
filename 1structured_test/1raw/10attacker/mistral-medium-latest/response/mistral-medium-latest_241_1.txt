To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the base rate of tall people in the population (from information a) and the witness testimonies (from information b). We can use Bayes' theorem for this.

Let A represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and W1 and W2 represent the events that witness 1 and witness 2 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, respectively. We are given:

P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(¬A) = 0.85 (from information a)
P(W1 | A) = 0.80 (from information b)
P(W1 | ¬A) = 0.20 (from information b)
P(W2 | A) = 0.30 (from information b)
P(W2 | ¬A) = 0.70 (from information b)

However, we need to find P(A | W1 ∧ ¬W2), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed they were and witness 2 claimed they were not. We can use the formula for the joint probability of independent events:

P(W1 ∧ ¬W2) = P(W1) \* P(¬W2)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can calculate P(W1) and P(¬W2) using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1 | A) \* P(A) + P(W1 | ¬A) \* P(¬A)
P(¬W2) = P(¬W2 | A) \* P(A) + P(¬W2 | ¬A) \* P(¬A)

We know P(¬W2 | A) = 1 - P(W2 | A) = 0.70, and P(¬W2 | ¬A) = 1 - P(W2 | ¬A) = 0.30. Substituting the given values, we get:

P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.255
P(¬W2) = (0.70 \* 0.15) + (0.30 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.405

Now we can find P(W1 ∧ ¬W2):

P(W1 ∧ ¬W2) = P(W1) \* P(¬W2) ≈ 0.255 \* 0.405 ≈ 0.103225

Finally, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(A | W1 ∧ ¬W2):

P(A | W1 ∧ ¬W2) = P(W1 ∧ ¬W2 | A) \* P(A) / P(W1 ∧ ¬W2)

Since witness 1 and witness 2 are independent, we have:

P(W1 ∧ ¬W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \* P(¬W2 | A) = 0.80 \* 0.70 = 0.56

Therefore:

P(A | W1 ∧ ¬W2) = (0.56 \* 0.15) / 0.103225 ≈ 0.8315

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.8315.
