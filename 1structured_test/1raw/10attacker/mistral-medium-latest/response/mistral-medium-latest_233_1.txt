To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. First, let's define some probabilities:

P(H) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (from the information a)
P(S) = Probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|H) = Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller (80%)
P(W1|S) = Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (20%)
P(W2|H) = Probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller (30%)
P(W2|S) = Probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are shorter than 185 cm (70%)

From the information provided, we know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(S) = 0.85.

We want to find the probability of P(H|W1), which is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claims so. To do this, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)]

First, calculate the numerator:

P(W1|H) \* P(H) = 0.8 \* 0.15 = 0.12

Next, calculate the denominator:

P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S) = 0.12 + 0.2 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, divide the numerator by the denominator to find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of Witness 1, is approximately 0.4138.
