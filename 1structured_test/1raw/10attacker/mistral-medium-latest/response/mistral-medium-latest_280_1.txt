To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a method of updating probabilities based on new evidence.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claims that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims it.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

We are given the following probabilities:

* P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(A) = 0.15, the probability that an attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution in the city
* P(B|¬A) = 0.2, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. This probability can be calculated by subtracting the witness's accuracy rate (0.8) from 1.
* P(¬A) = 0.85, the probability that an attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population distribution in the city

We can calculate P(B) as follows:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|¬A) \* P(¬A)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) \* P(A)) / P(B)
= (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
= 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
