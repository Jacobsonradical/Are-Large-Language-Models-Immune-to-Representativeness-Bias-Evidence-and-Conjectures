To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (from information b)
P(~T) as the prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (from information b)
P(W1|T) as the likelihood of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 (from information a)
P(W1|~T) as the likelihood of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.2 (from information a)

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(T|W1) = P(W1|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1|T) \* P(T) + P(W1|~T) \* P(~T)]

Plugging in the values:

P(T|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

Calculating the expression:
P(T|W1) â‰ˆ 0.2667

So the estimated probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, given the information provided, is approximately 0.2667.
