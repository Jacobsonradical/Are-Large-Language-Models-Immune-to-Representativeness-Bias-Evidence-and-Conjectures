To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H, and the event that the first witness reports that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1. Our goal is to find P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness reported that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H | W1) = P(W1 | H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(W1 | H) = 0.8, which is the probability that the first witness reports that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.

P(H) = 0.15, which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution in the city.

To find P(W1), the probability that the first witness reports that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we need to consider two possible scenarios: either the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, or the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We can use the law of total probability to find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1 | H) \* P(H) + P(W1 | not H) \* P(not H)

We are given that:

P(W1 | not H) = 0.2, which is the probability that the first witness reports that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

P(not H) = 0.85, which is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm based on the population distribution in the city.

Substituting the given values, we have:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can find P(H | W1):

P(H | W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
