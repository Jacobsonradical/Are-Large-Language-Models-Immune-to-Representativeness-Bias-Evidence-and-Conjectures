To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

We are given:

P(H) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from information a)

To find P(W1), we need to consider both the possibility of the attacker being 185 cm or taller and the witness claiming so, as well as the possibility of the attacker being shorter and the witness still claiming so:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We are given:

P(W1|not H) = 0.20 (from information a)
P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 (from information b)

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 + 0.20 \* 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.29 = 0.12 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
