To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) = probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(F) = probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|T) = probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (80%)
P(W1|F) = probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (20%)
P(W2|T) = probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (30%)
P(W2|F) = probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (70%)

From information (b), we have prior probabilities:

P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies:

P(T|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1, W2|F) \* P(F)]

First, we need to find the probabilities P(W1, W2|T) and P(W1, W2|F). Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we can multiply the conditional probabilities:

P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|F) = P(W1|F) \* P(W2|F) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate the posterior probability:

P(T|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]

The result is approximately:

P(T|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.198

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.198 or 19.8%.
