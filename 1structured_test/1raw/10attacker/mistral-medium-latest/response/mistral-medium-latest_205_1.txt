To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a mathematical formula for determining conditional probabilities.

First, let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A, and the event that a witness correctly identifies the height as C. We want to find the probability P(A|C) for each witness.

From the given information, we know that:

1. The prior probability P(A) = 0.15 (from information a)
2. The probability of a correct identification by the first witness, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is P(C|A) = 0.8 for the first witness (from information b)
3. The probability of a correct identification by the first witness, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is P(C|¬A) = 0.8 for the first witness (from information b)
4. The probability of a correct identification by the second witness, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is P(C|A) = 0.7 for the second witness (from information b)
5. The probability of a correct identification by the second witness, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is P(C|¬A) = 0.7 for the second witness (from information b)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|C) for each witness as follows:

For the first witness:
P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / [ P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A) ]
P(A|C) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [ (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.8 \* 0.85) ] ≈ 0.165

For the second witness:
P(A|C) = P(C|A) \* P(A) / [ P(C|A) \* P(A) + P(C|¬A) \* P(¬A) ]
P(A|C) = (0.7 \* 0.15) / [ (0.7 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85) ] ≈ 0.12

Now, we need to combine the probabilities from both witnesses. Since they are independent, we can use the product rule of probability:

P(A|C1 ∩ C2) = P(A|C1) \* P(A|C2)
P(A|C1 ∩ C2) ≈ 0.165 \* 0.12 ≈ 0.0198

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.0198}
