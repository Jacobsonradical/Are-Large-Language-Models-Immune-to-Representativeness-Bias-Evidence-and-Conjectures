To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and W represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W).

Bayes' theorem states that P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W). We are given P(H) = 0.15 and P(W|H) = 0.80. However, we still need to find P(W).

Since there are two witnesses who give contradictory statements, we can express P(W) as follows:

P(W) = P(W and attacker is short) + P(W and attacker is tall)
= P(W|attacker is short) \* P(attacker is short) + P(W|attacker is tall) \* P(attacker is tall)
= P(W|not H) \* P(not H) + P(W|H) \* P(H)

We are given that P(W|not H) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is tall 20% of the time when the attacker is actually short). We also know that P(not H) = 1 - P(H) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85.

Now we can calculate P(W):

P(W) = 0.20 \* 0.85 + 0.80 \* 0.15 = 0.17 + 0.12 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = P(W|H) \* P(H) / P(W) = 0.80 \* 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138
