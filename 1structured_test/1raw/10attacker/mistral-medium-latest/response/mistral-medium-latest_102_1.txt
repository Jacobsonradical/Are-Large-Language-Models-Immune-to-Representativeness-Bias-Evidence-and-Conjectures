To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimonies and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B1 and B2 represent the events that the first and second witnesses testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively. We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified so.

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(A|B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) / P(B1)

We are given the following probabilities:

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find P(B1), the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B1) = P(B1|A) \* P(A) + P(B1|¬A) \* P(¬A)

We are missing P(B1|¬A), the probability that the first witness testifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm, this probability is:

P(B1|¬A) = 0.2

Now we can calculate P(B1):

P(B1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) ≈ 0.23

Finally, we can calculate P(A|B1):

P(A|B1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.23 ≈ 0.522

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.522.
