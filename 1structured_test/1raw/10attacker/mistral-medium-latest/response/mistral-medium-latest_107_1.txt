To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the information provided in a).

P(~H) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W1|H) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.8 based on the information provided in b).

P(W1|~H) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller, which is 0.2.

P(W2|H) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.7.

P(W2|~H) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.3.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses as follows:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1, W2)

Since the witnesses are independent, we can calculate the joint probability of their testimony given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as:

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Similarly, we can calculate the joint probability of their testimony given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm as:

P(W1, W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Therefore, the joint probability of the witnesses' testimony is:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 = 0.063

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses as:

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \* 0.15 / 0.063 = 0.54

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is 0.54.
