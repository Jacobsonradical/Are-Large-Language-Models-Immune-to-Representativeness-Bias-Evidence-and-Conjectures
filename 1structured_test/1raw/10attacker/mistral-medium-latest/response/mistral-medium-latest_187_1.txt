To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional probabilities of two events, in this case, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (H) given the testimony of the first witness (W).

First, let's calculate the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) based on the population distribution given in information b:

P(H) = 0.15

Next, we need to find the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (P(W|H)). This is provided in information a:

P(W|H) = 0.80

Now we need the likelihood of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (P(W|¬H)). We can find this by using the complementary probability of the witness's error rate:

P(W|¬H) = 1 - P(error when attacker is shorter) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80

However, this likelihood should be based on the witness's performance with people who are shorter than 185 cm. Since the witness's accuracy was tested with half shorter and half 185 cm or taller individuals, we need to adjust this likelihood based on the population distribution:

P(W|¬H) = 0.80 \* (0.7 / 0.5) = 1.12 \* 0.7 = 0.784

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W) = [P(W|H) \* P(H)] / [P(W|H) \* P(H) + P(W|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.784 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.161

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.161.
