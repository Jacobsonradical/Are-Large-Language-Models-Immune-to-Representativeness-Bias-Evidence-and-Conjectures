To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of information: the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates, and the population distribution of heights in the city.

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony can be calculated as follows:

P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness 1) = (P(Witness 1 | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+)) / P(Witness 1)

We know that:

P(Witness 1 | Attacker is 185+) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(Attacker is 185+) = 0.15 (the population distribution)

To find P(Witness 1), we need to consider both the possibility that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the possibility that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:

P(Witness 1) = P(Witness 1 | Attacker is 185+) \* P(Attacker is 185+) + P(Witness 1 | Attacker is <185) \* P(Attacker is <185)

Since the first witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller:

P(Witness 1 | Attacker is <185) = 0.2
P(Attacker is <185) = 0.85

Now we can calculate P(Witness 1):

P(Witness 1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Finally, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

P(Attacker is 185+ | Witness 1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So the estimated probability is:
{probability: 0.4138}
