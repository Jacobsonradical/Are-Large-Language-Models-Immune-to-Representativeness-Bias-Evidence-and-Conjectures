To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|W1).

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know that:

P(A) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|A) = 0.80 (since the first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)

However, we don't know the value of P(W1) directly. We need to find P(W1) in terms of P(A) and P(W1|A). To do this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|not A) \* P(not A)

Since the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, we know that P(W1|not A) = 1 - P(W2|A) (since the two witnesses' statements are contradictory). From the information given, we know that the second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time, so P(W2|A) = 0.30. Therefore:

P(W1|not A) = 1 - P(W2|A) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|not A) \* P(not A)
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.70 \* (1 - 0.15))

Now we can find P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = P(W1|A) \* P(A) / P(W1)
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.12 / 0.425
P(A|W1) ≈ 0.2823

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2823.
