To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to find the probability of a hypothesis (H) given some evidence (E) by taking into account the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.

In this case, the hypothesis (H) is that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. The evidence (E) is the testimony of the first witness.

Bayes' theorem can be stated mathematically as follows:

P(H|E) = [P(E|H) \* P(H)] / [P(E|H) \* P(H) + P(E|not H) \* P(not H)]

where:

* P(H|E) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis given the evidence
* P(E|H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis
* P(H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis
* P(not H) is the prior probability of the hypothesis not being true
* P(E|not H) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis not being true

We are given the following information:

* P(H) = 0.15 (from point b: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(not H) = 0.85 (from point b: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(E|H) = 0.80 (from point a: the first witness correctly identifies heights of 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(E|not H) = 0.20 (from point a: the first witness incorrectly identifies heights as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter)

Plugging these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(H|E) = [0.80 \* 0.15] / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.3605

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.3605.
