To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here are the steps:

1. Define the probabilities:
Let P(H) be the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (from information a).
Let P(S) be the prior probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
Let P(W1|H) be the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let P(W1|S) be the probability that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
Let P(W2|H) be the probability that the second witness says the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let P(W2|S) be the probability that the second witness says the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we know that:
P(H) = 0.15
P(S) = 0.85
P(W1|H) = 0.80
P(W1|S) = 0.20
P(W2|H) = 0.30
P(W2|S) = 0.70

2. Calculate the posterior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said it was 185 cm or taller:
Let P(H|W1) be the posterior probability. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)]
= (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
= 0.18 / (0.18 + 0.17)
= 0.18 / 0.35
= 0.5143

3. Calculate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimony:
Let P(H|W1,W2) be the probability we want to calculate. Using Bayes' theorem again, we have:
P(H|W1,W2) = P(W2|H,W1) \* P(H|W1) / [P(W2|H,W1) \* P(H|W1) + P(W2|S,W1) \* P(S|W1)]

Since the witnesses' testimony is conditionally independent given the attacker's height, we have:
P(W2|H,W1) = P(W2|H)
P(W2|S,W1) = P(W2|S)

We already calculated P(H|W1) in step 2, so we need to compute P(S|W1):
P(S|W1) = P(W1|S) \* P(S) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|S) \* P(S)]
= (0.20 \* 0.85) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]
= 0.17 / 0.35
= 0.4857

Now we can calculate P(H|W1,W2):
P(H|W1,W2) = P(W2|H) \* P(H|W1) / [P(W2|H) \* P(H|W1) + P(W2|S) \* P(S|W1)]
= (0.30 \* 0.5143) / [(0.30 \* 0.5143) + (0.70 \* 0.4857)]
= 0.1543 / (0.1543 + 0.3400)
= 0.1543 / 0.4943
= 0.3121

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.3121.
