{probability: 0.598}

Here's how I arrived at this estimate:

1. First, we need to consider the base rate of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 15%. This gives us a prior probability of P(Tall) = 0.15.
2. Next, we need to consider the testimony of the first witness, who correctly identifies a person's height as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker was tall given that the attacker is actually tall is P(W1|Tall) = 0.8.
3. However, we also need to consider the possibility that the witness could incorrectly testify that the attacker was tall even if they were not. The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker was tall given that the attacker is actually short is P(W1|Not Tall) = 0.2.
4. Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was tall given the testimony of the first witness: P(Tall|W1) = [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(W1|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W1|Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)].
5. Plugging in the values, we get: P(Tall|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] = 0.36 / (0.36 + 0.17) = 0.676.
6. However, we also need to consider the testimony of the second witness, who correctly identifies a person's height as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker was not tall given that the attacker is actually not tall is P(W2|Not Tall) = 0.7.
7. Similarly, we need to consider the possibility that the witness could incorrectly testify that the attacker was not tall even if they were. The probability of the witness testifying that the attacker was not tall given that the attacker is actually tall is P(W2|Tall) = 0.3.
8. Using Bayes' theorem again, we can calculate the probability that the attacker was tall given the testimony of the second witness: P(Tall|W2) = [P(W2|Tall) \* P(Tall)] / [P(W2|Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(W2|Not Tall) \* P(Not Tall)].
9. Plugging in the values, we get: P(Tall|W2) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)] = 0.045 / (0.045 + 0.595) = 0.07.
10. Finally, since the two witnesses are independent, we can multiply the probabilities obtained from each witness's testimony to get the overall probability that the attacker was tall: P(Tall|W1 and W2) = P(Tall|W1) \* P(Tall|W2) = 0.676 \* 0.07 = 0.04732 or 4.732%.
11. However, this probability is quite low, and it may be more appropriate to consider the possibility that one of the witnesses is more reliable than the other. If we assume that the first witness is more reliable than the second witness (based on their higher accuracy rate), then we might want to give more weight to their testimony. One way to do this is to take a weighted average of the two probabilities, with the weights reflecting the relative reliability of the two witnesses: P(Tall|W1 and W2) = (0.8 \* P(Tall|W1) + 0.2 \* P(Tall|W2)) / (0.8 + 0.2) = (0.8 \* 0.676 + 0.2 \* 0.07) / (1) = 0.598.
12. Therefore, I would estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, to be approximately 0.598.
