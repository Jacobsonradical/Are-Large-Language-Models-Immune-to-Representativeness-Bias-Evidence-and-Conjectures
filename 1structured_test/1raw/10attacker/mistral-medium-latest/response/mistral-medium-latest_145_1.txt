To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, you can use Bayes' theorem. First, calculate the prior probability based on the population distribution (information b) and then update it using the likelihood of the witness's testimony (information a).

The prior probability P(H ≥ 185 cm), based on the population distribution, is 0.15.

The likelihood of the first witness's testimony, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8 (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time).

Now you can calculate the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | testimony) = [P(testimony | H ≥ 185 cm) \* P(H ≥ 185 cm)] / [P(testimony | H ≥ 185 cm) \* P(H ≥ 185 cm) + P(testimony | H < 185 cm) \* P(H < 185 cm)]

Since the second witness's testimony is not considered in this specific question, you can simplify the equation as follows:

P(H ≥ 185 cm | testimony) = P(testimony | H ≥ 185 cm) \* P(H ≥ 185 cm) / P(testimony)

Since you do not have the probability of the testimony P(testimony), you cannot directly calculate the posterior probability. However, you can estimate it by comparing the likelihood of the testimony given the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller versus the likelihood of the testimony given the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Likelihood ratio = LR = P(testimony | H ≥ 185 cm) / P(testimony | H < 185 cm)

Since the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time:

P(testimony | H < 185 cm) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.3 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.42

LR ≈ 0.8 / 0.42 ≈ 1.905

Given the likelihood ratio LR, you can estimate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = Prior odds \* Likelihood ratio

Prior odds = P(H ≥ 185 cm) / P(H < 185 cm) = 0.15 / 0.85 ≈ 0.176

Posterior odds ≈ 0.176 \* 1.905 ≈ 0.335

Finally, convert the posterior odds to a probability:

Posterior probability = Posterior odds / (1 + Posterior odds)

{probability: 0.335 / (1 + 0.335) ≈ 0.24}
