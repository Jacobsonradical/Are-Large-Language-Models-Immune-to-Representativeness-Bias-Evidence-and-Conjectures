To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
A: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem statement, we know the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (from statement a)
P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
P(A|H) = 0.8 (from statement b)
P(A|¬H) = 0.2 (from statement b)
P(B|H) = 0.3 (from statement b)
P(B|¬H) = 0.7 (from statement b)

Since the witnesses make independent claims, we have:

P(A and B|H) = P(A|H) \* P(B|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24
P(A and B|¬H) = P(A|¬H) \* P(B|¬H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

We're interested in the probability P(H|A and B). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|A and B) = P(H) \* P(A and B|H) / P(A and B)

To find P(A and B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(A and B) = P(A and B|H) \* P(H) + P(A and B|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Plugging in the values:

P(A and B) = 0.24 \* 0.15 + 0.14 \* 0.85 ≈ 0.141

Now, we can find the desired probability:

P(H|A and B) = 0.15 \* 0.24 / 0.141 ≈ 0.2986
