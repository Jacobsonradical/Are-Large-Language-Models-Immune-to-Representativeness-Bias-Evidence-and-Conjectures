To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
A: The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
B: The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|A, B), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|A, B) = P(A|H, B) \* P(H) / [P(A|H, B) \* P(H) + P(A|H', B) \* P(H')]

We are given P(H) = 0.15 and P(H') = 0.85.

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, we can rewrite P(A|H, B) as P(A|H) and P(A|H', B) as P(A|H').

We are given P(A|H) = 0.80 and P(A|H') = 0.20 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time).

Now we need to find P(B|H) and P(B|H'). However, we are only given information about the second witness's accuracy, not their response to this specific case. So we can't directly use Bayes' theorem to find P(B|H) and P(B|H').

Instead, let's consider the probability that the first witness is correct (P(A|H)) and the second witness is incorrect (P(B|H')), and the probability that the first witness is incorrect (P(A|H')) and the second witness is correct (P(B|H)). Then we can use these probabilities to update our estimate of P(H).

The probability that the first witness is correct and the second witness is incorrect is:

P(A|H) \* P(B|H') = 0.80 \* (1 - 0.70) = 0.24

The probability that the first witness is incorrect and the second witness is correct is:

P(A|H') \* P(B|H) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now we can update our estimate of P(H) using these probabilities:

P(H|A, B) = P(A|H, B) \* P(H) / [P(A|H, B) \* P(H) + P(A|H', B) \* P(H')]
= (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]
= 0.21 / (0.21 + 0.12)
= 0.636

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.636.
