To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as W1. We want to find P(H|W1).

Bayes' theorem states that:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

First, let's find P(W1|H). This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. From the provided information, the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Therefore, P(W1|H) = 0.8.

Next, let's find P(H). This is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution. According to the information, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, P(H) = 0.15.

Now we need to find P(W1). This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. To find this, we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)

We already know P(W1|H) and P(H). We also need P(¬H), which is the probability that the attacker is not 185 cm or taller. Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, 85% is not: P(¬H) = 0.85.

To find P(W1|¬H), we use the fact that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time. However, this is not exactly what we need, as we want the probability that the first witness claims a person is 185 cm or taller given that they are actually shorter. Since there are only two possibilities (shorter or 185 cm or taller) and the witness is correct 80% of the time, the witness must be incorrect and claim a person is 185 cm or taller when they are actually shorter 20% of the time. Therefore, P(W1|¬H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)
        = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
        ≈ 0.12 + 0.17
        ≈ 0.29

Finally, we can calculate P(H|W1) using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
          ≈ 0.8 \* 0.15 / 0.29
          ≈ 0.12 / 0.29
          ≈ 0.4138

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is approximately 0.4138.
