To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B represent the event that the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(A|B).

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(A|B) as follows:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) / P(B)

From the information given, we know that:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller)

We also need to calculate P(B), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We can do this by considering two cases: (1) the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller, and the witness correctly identifies this, and (2) the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm, but the witness incorrectly claims they were 185 cm or taller. So we have:

P(B) = P(B|A) \* P(A) + P(B|not A) \* P(not A)

We already know P(B|A) and P(A), and we can calculate P(not A) as 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm). We also need to know P(B|not A), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm. This is the probability of a false positive error for the first witness, which we know to be 0.2 (the first witness errs in 20% of cases where the person's height is actually shorter than 185 cm).

So we have:

P(B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|B) as:

P(A|B) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
