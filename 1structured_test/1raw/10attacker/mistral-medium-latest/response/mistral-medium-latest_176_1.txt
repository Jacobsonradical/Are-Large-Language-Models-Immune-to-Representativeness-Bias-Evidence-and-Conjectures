To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(F) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|T) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W1|F) as the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W2|T) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(W2|F) as the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given the information provided:

P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(F) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(W1|T) = 0.80 (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
P(W1|F) = 0.20 (first witness errs 20% of the time)
P(W2|T) = 0.30 (second witness errs 30% of the time)
P(W2|F) = 0.70 (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)

Now we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(T|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T)] / [P(W1, W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1, W2|F) \* P(F)]

Since the witnesses provide independent testimonies:

P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|F) = P(W1|F) \* P(W2|F) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Substituting the values into the equation:

P(T|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.198

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.198.
