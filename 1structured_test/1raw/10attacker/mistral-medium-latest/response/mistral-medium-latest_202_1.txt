To estimate the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We will consider two events: E1 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller) and W1 (the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller). We want to find P(E1|W1).

Bayes' theorem states: P(E1|W1) = P(W1|E1) \* P(E1) / P(W1)

We have the following probabilities:

P(E1) = Probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15 (from information b)
P(W1|E1) = Probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller, given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.8 (from information a)

We still need to find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of their actual height. We can calculate this using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|E1) \* P(E1) + P(W1|E1') \* P(E1')

Where E1' represents the complementary event of E1 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm). We have:

P(E1') = 1 - P(E1) = 0.85
P(W1|E1') = Probability of the first witness incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are shorter = 0.2 (from information a)

Now we can calculate P(W1):

P(W1) = 0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.85
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W1) = 0.29

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate P(E1|W1):

P(E1|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(E1|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4138
