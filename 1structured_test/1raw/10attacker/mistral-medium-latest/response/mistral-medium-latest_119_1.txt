To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness testified that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the information given, we know that:

* P(W1|H) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height of a person who is 185 cm or taller
* P(H) = 0.15, the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (from information b)
* P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H), the total probability of the first witness testifying that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller

We need to find P(W1|~H), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm. From the information given, we know that:

* P(W1|~H) = 0.2, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height of a person who is shorter than 185 cm
* P(~H) = 0.85, the prior probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm (from information b)

Substituting these values into the equation for P(W1), we get:

P(W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Substituting the values for P(W1|H), P(H), and P(W1) into the equation for P(H|W1), we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.09 / 0.29 = 0.31

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is 0.31.
