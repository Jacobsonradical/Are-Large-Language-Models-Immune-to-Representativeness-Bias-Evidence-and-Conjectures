To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimony and the population distribution.

First, let's calculate the probability that each witness is correct, given their accuracy rates and the population distribution:

1. For the first witness, who has an 80% accuracy rate and observed someone 185 cm or taller:

   - The prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller is 15% (from information b).
   - Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, given the witness's testimony, is:

     P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = [P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 1 testimony)

     Since the witness is 80% accurate when the person is 185 cm or taller, P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
     The prior probability P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) is 0.15.
     The probability of the witness's testimony, P(Witness 1 testimony), can be calculated as:

     P(Witness 1 testimony) = P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller) + P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller)

     Given that the witness errs 20% of the time when the person is not 185 cm or taller, P(Witness 1 testimony | Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) = 0.2.
     The prior probability P(Attacker is not 185 cm or taller) is 0.85.

     Plugging in the values, we get:

     P(Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)

     Now we can find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

     P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 1 testimony) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

2. For the second witness, who has a 70% accuracy rate and observed someone shorter than 185 cm:

   - The prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm is 85% (from information b).
   - Since the witness errs 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, the probability of the witness's testimony, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.3.
   - Using Bayes' theorem again, we can find the probability that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, given the second witness's testimony:

     P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 testimony) = [P(Witness 2 testimony | Attacker is 185 cm or taller) \* P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller)] / P(Witness 2 testimony)

     P(Attacker is 185 cm or taller | Witness 2 testimony) = (0.3 \* 0.15) / [(0.3 \* 0.15) + (0.7 \* 0.85)]

Since both witnesses provided contradictory testimonies, we cannot simply combine their probabilities. Instead, we should consider the probability of the first witness being correct, given their higher accuracy rate:

{probability: 0.449, please provide a number between 0 and 1}

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.449.
