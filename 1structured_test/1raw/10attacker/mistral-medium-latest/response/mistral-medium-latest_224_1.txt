To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimony and the population distribution. We can use Bayes' theorem for this estimation.

Let A represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let W1 represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The probability we are looking for is P(A|W1).

First, we need to calculate P(A) and P(W1|A). Based on the population distribution:

P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller)

P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller)

Next, we need to consider the probability of the alternative hypothesis, that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, represented as B. Also, let W1' represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

P(B) = 0.85 (the probability that a random person from the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, since the first witness either claims the attacker is shorter or taller than 185 cm, we can say that P(W1|B) is the probability of error by the first witness, which is 0.20.

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) \* P(A)] / [P(W1|A) \* P(A) + P(W1|B) \* P(B)]

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / [(0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)]

Calculate the probability:

P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.3855

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3855.
