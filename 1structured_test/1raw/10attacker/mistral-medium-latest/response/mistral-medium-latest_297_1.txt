To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(Tall) as the prior probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to information b.

P(Short) as the prior probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(WTall | Tall) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person, which is 0.8 according to information a.

P(WShort | Short) as the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a short person, which is 0.8.

P(WErrorTall | Short) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall, which is 0.2.

P(WErrorShort | Tall) as the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short, which is 0.2.

P(WShort | Tall) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a tall person, which is 0.7.

P(WTall | Short) as the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short person, which is 0.7.

P(WErrorShort | Tall) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short, which is 0.3.

P(WErrorTall | Short) as the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall, which is 0.3.

Given that the first witness identified the attacker as tall, we want to find P(Tall | WTall), the posterior probability that the attacker is indeed tall. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(Tall | WTall) = P(WTall | Tall) \* P(Tall) / [P(WTall | Tall) \* P(Tall) + P(WTall | Short) \* P(Short)]

Since the first witness identified the attacker as tall, the second witness's testimony is not relevant to this calculation. Thus:

P(Tall | WTall) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)] ≈ 0.385

However, this probability does not take into account the fact that the second witness identified the attacker as short. To incorporate this information, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is tall given both witnesses' testimonies using the law of total probability:

P(Tall | WTall, WShort) = P(Tall | WTall) \* P(WShort | Tall) / [P(Tall | WTall) \* P(WShort | Tall) + P(Short | WTall) \* P(WTall | Short)]

Plugging in the values:

P(Tall | WTall, WShort) = (0.385 \* 0.3) / [(0.385 \* 0.3) + (0.615 \* 0.2)] ≈ 0.183

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.183.
