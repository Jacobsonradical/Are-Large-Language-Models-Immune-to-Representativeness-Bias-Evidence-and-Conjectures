To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence.

Let's denote:

* H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W1: the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* W2: the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(H): the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(W1|H): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(W2|H): the probability that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
* P(W1|¬H): the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
* P(W2|¬H): the probability that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided, we know that:

* P(H) = 0.15 (from point b)
* P(¬H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85
* P(W1|H) = 0.8 (from point a)
* P(W2|H) = 1 - P(W1|H) = 0.2 (since there are only two witnesses)
* P(W1|¬H) = 0.2 (from point a)
* P(W2|¬H) = 0.7 (from point a)

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬H)]

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]

P(H|W1) ≈ 0.397

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.397.
