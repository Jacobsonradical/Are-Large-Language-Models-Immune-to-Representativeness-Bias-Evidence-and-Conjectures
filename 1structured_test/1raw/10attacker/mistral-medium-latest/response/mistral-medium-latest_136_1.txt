To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to update probabilities based on new evidence. Here, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the two witnesses.

Let's denote:

P(T) as the prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city, which is 0.15 or 15% (from information a).

P(S) as the prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 or 85% (from information a).

P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80 or 80% (from information b).

P(W1|S) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20 or 20% (from information b).

P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30 or 30% (from information b).

P(W2|S) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70 or 70% (from information b).

We want to find P(T|W1,W2), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(T|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1,W2|S) \* P(S)]

First, let's find P(W1,W2|T) and P(W1,W2|S). Since the witnesses are independent, we can write:

P(W1,W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24

P(W1,W2|S) = P(W1|S) \* P(W2|S) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now, we can find P(T|W1,W2):

P(T|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)]

P(T|W1,W2) â‰ˆ 0.208 or 20.8%

However, this probability is based on the assumption that the witnesses are independent and that their errors are random. If there are other factors affecting their testimony, such as bias or collusion, the probability might be different.
