To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of evidence: the general population statistics (a) and the testimony of the two witnesses (b).

First, let's find the prior probability P(H), which is the probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller based on the information in (a):

P(H) = 0.15

Now let's find the likelihoods of the witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (L1) and shorter than 185 cm (L2):

L1 = 0.8 (first witness's accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
L2 = 0.3 (second witness's inaccuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm, which is equivalent to 1 - 0.7)

Next, we'll find the posterior probability P(H|E) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the evidence from the witnesses' testimonies. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|E) = [P(H) \* L1] / [P(H) \* L1 + P(~H) \* L2]

First, we need P(~H), which is the probability that a random person from the population is shorter than 185 cm:

P(~H) = 0.85

Now, we can calculate P(H|E):

P(H|E) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / [(0.15 \* 0.8) + (0.85 \* 0.3)]

P(H|E) â‰ˆ 0.286

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.286.
