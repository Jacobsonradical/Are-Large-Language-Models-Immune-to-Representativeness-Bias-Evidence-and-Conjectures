To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as H and the witness testimony as W1 (first witness) and W2 (second witness).

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) / [P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|not H) * P(not H)]

First, we know that P(H) = 0.15 and P(not H) = 0.85 from the information provided.

Next, we need P(W1|H) and P(W1|not H). These are the probabilities of the first witness's testimony given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

Since the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, P(W1|H) = 0.8.

However, when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the first witness will incorrectly claim that they are 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. So, P(W1|not H) = 0.2.

Now we can calculate P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = (0.8 \* 0.15) / [(0.8 \* 0.15) + (0.2 \* 0.85)]
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.2963

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2963.
