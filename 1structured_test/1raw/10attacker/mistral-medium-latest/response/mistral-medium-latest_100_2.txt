To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the witness testimony and the population distribution.

First, let's calculate the weighted average of the witness testimony based on their accuracy rates:

Weighted average = (0.8 \* Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness testimony)) + (0.7 \* Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness testimony))

Since the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter, we have:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | first witness testimony) = 1
Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | second witness testimony) = 0

So the weighted average becomes:

Weighted average = (0.8 \* 1) + (0.7 \* 0) = 0.8

However, we also need to take into account the population distribution. Let's call the probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the population distribution Pr(population). From the information given, we know that:

Pr(population) = 0.15

To combine the weighted average of the witness testimony and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = Pr(population) \* (Weighted average / Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | population))

Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, the probability of a random witness identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.15, regardless of their accuracy rate. So we have:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller | population) = 0.15

Substituting this value into Bayes' theorem, we get:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.15 \* 0.8) / 0.15 = 0.8

However, this result does not fully take into account the population distribution. To incorporate it more accurately, we can use a method called "Bayesian averaging" or "linear opinion pooling". This method combines the witness testimony and the population distribution by taking a weighted average of their probabilities, where the weights are proportional to their reliability:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* Pr(population) + 0.2 \* Weighted average) / (0.8 \* 1 + 0.2 \* 1)

The weights 0.8 and 0.2 are chosen because the first witness is more reliable than the second witness (80% vs 70% accuracy rate), and we want to give more weight to the more reliable testimony. Additionally, we use a weight of 1 for the population distribution, as it represents the prior probability before considering any witness testimony.

Substituting the values, we get:

Pr(attacker is 185 cm or taller) = (0.8 \* 0.15 + 0.2 \* 0.8) / (0.8 \* 1 + 0.2 \* 1) = 0.168 / 1 = 0.168

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.168}
