To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(H) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (based on the population distribution), which is 0.15 (from information b).

P(~H) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

P(W1|H) as the likelihood that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are, which is 0.8 (from information a).

P(W1|~H) as the likelihood that Witness 1 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not, which is 0.2 (from information a).

P(W2|H) as the likelihood that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller, which is 0.3 (from information a).

P(W2|~H) as the likelihood that Witness 2 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not, which is 0.7 (from information a).

We want to find P(H|W1,W2), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses. Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1,W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1,W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

However, we cannot calculate P(W1,W2|H) and P(W1,W2|~H) directly, since we don't have information on the correlation between the witnesses' testimonies.

Instead, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of each witness separately:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|~H) \* P(~H)]
P(H|W2) = P(W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

P(H|W1) ≈ 0.15 \* 0.8 / [0.15 \* 0.8 + 0.85 \* 0.2] ≈ 0.469
P(H|W2) ≈ 0.15 \* 0.7 / [0.15 \* 0.7 + 0.85 \* 0.3] ≈ 0.259

Since the witnesses are independent, we can approximate the combined probability by taking the product of the individual probabilities:

P(H|W1,W2) ≈ P(H|W1) \* P(H|W2) ≈ 0.469 \* 0.259 ≈ 0.122
