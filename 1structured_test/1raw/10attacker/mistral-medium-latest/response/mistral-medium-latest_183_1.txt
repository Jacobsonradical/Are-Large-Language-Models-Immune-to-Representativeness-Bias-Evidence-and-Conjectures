To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We have two pieces of evidence:

1. Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller (P(H)) based on the population distribution: P(H) = 0.15
2. Two witnesses' testimonies with their respective accuracy rates:
   - Witness 1: P(W1|H) = 0.8 (80% accuracy when the person is 185 cm or taller)
   - Witness 1: P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (20% error rate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
   - Witness 2: P(W2|H) = 0.3 (70% error rate when the person is 185 cm or taller)
   - Witness 2: P(W2|~H) = 0.7 (30% accuracy when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

However, we need to account for the fact that the two witnesses are providing contradictory testimonies. Let's first calculate the probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (P(W1, W2|H)):

P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* P(W2|H) = 0.8 \* 0.3 = 0.24

Now let's calculate the probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (P(W1, W2|~H)):

P(W1, W2|~H) = P(W1|~H) \* P(W2|~H) = 0.2 \* 0.7 = 0.14

Next, we need the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies (P(H|W1, W2)):

P(H|W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) / [P(W1, W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, W2|~H) \* P(~H)]

Plugging in the values:

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.279

So the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.279.
