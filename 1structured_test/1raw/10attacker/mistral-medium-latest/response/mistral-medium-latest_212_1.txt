To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

P(T) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
P(F) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
P(W1|T) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are
P(W1|F) as the probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that they are not
P(W2|T) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are
P(W2|F) as the probability that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not

From the problem statement, we have:
P(T) = 0.15
P(F) = 0.85
P(W1|T) = 0.80
P(W1|F) = 0.20
P(W2|T) = 0.30
P(W2|F) = 0.70

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses:

P(T|W1,W2) = P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) / [P(W1,W2|T) \* P(T) + P(W1,W2|F) \* P(F)]

First, let's calculate P(W1,W2|T) and P(W1,W2|F):

P(W1,W2|T) = P(W1|T) \* P(W2|T) = 0.80 \* 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1,W2|F) = P(W1|F) \* P(W2|F) = 0.20 \* 0.70 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(T|W1,W2):

P(T|W1,W2) = (0.24 \* 0.15) / [(0.24 \* 0.15) + (0.14 \* 0.85)] â‰ˆ 0.214

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the two witnesses, is approximately 0.214.
