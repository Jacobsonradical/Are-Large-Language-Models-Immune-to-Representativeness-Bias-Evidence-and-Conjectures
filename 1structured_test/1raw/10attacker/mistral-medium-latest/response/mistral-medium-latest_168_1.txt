To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let H represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and W1 represent the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller. We want to find P(H|W1).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)

From the given information, we know that:

P(H) = 0.15 (from a)

P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person's height is 185 cm or taller)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)

We need to find P(W1|not H), which is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the attacker's height was actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness errs in 20% of the cases, we have:

P(W1|not H) = 0.20

Now we can find P(W1):

P(W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) + P(W1|not H) \* P(not H)
P(W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.85)
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17
P(W1) = 0.29

Now we can find P(H|W1):

P(H|W1) = P(W1|H) \* P(H) / P(W1)
P(H|W1) = (0.80 \* 0.15) / 0.29
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.
