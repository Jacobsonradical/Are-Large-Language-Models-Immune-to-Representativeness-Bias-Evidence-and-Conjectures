To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

H: the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
W1: the event that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2: the event that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given the following probabilities:

P(H) = 0.15 (from information a)
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (from information b)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (from information b)
P(W2|H) = 0.30 (since Witness 2 errs 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬H) = 0.70 (from information b)

Since the two witnesses provide contradictory statements, we can use P(W2) = 1 - P(W1) and P(W2|¬H) = 1 - P(W1|H) to simplify our calculations.

Now we want to find P(H|W1, ¬W2). Using Bayes' theorem:

P(H|W1, ¬W2) = P(W1, ¬W2|H) \* P(H) / P(W1, ¬W2)

We can rewrite P(W1, ¬W2|H) as P(W1|H) \* P(¬W2|H) = P(W1|H) \* (1 - P(W2|H)).

The denominator P(W1, ¬W2) can be found using the law of total probability:

P(W1, ¬W2) = P(W1, ¬W2|H) \* P(H) + P(W1, ¬W2|¬H) \* P(¬H)

Since P(W1, ¬W2|¬H) = P(W1|¬H) \* P(¬W2|¬H) = P(W1|¬H) \* (1 - P(W2|¬H)), we have:

P(W1, ¬W2) = [P(W1|H) \* (1 - P(W2|H))] \* P(H) + [P(W1|¬H) \* (1 - P(W2|¬H))] \* (1 - P(H))

Now we can calculate P(H|W1, ¬W2):

P(H|W1, ¬W2) = [P(W1|H) \* (1 - P(W2|H))] \* P(H) / {[P(W1|H) \* (1 - P(W2|H))] \* P(H) + [P(W1|¬H) \* (1 - P(W2|¬H))] \* (1 - P(H))}

Substituting the given probabilities:

P(H|W1, ¬W2) = (0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) / {(0.80 \* 0.70 \* 0.15) + (0.20 \* 0.30 \* 0.85)} ≈ 0.407
