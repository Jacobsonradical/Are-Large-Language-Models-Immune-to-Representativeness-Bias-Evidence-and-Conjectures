To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and their reliability, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We know:
- \( P(T \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(T < 185) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm).

Witness 1 statements:
- True positive rate (\( P(W1\_correct | T \geq 185) \)) = 0.80
- False positive rate (\( P(W1\_incorrect | T < 185) \)) = 0.20

Witness 2 statements:
- True negative rate (\( P(W2\_correct | T < 185) \)) = 0.70
- False negative rate (\( P(W2\_incorrect | T \geq 185) \)) = 0.30

We need to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness' statement that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, i.e., \( P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) \).

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) = \frac{P(W1\_T \geq 185 | T \geq 185) * P(T \geq 185)}{P(W1\_T \geq 185)} \]

The probability \( P(W1\_T \geq 185) \) (that the first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1\_T \geq 185) = P(W1\_T \geq 185 | T \geq 185) * P(T \geq 185) + P(W1\_T \geq 185 | T < 185) * P(T < 185) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W1\_T \geq 185) = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1\_T \geq 185) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1\_T \geq 185) = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) \):
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \geq 185 | W1\_T \geq 185) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement and the available data, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
