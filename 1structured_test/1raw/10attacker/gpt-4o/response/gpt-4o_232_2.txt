To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to take into account the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller and the likelihood of each witness’s testimony being correct.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_A \): First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_B \): First witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_A \): Second witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_B \): Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

Also, given the accuracies of the witnesses:
- \( P(W1_A | A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W1_B | A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W2_A | A) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W2_B | A) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W1_A | B) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W1_B | B) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W2_A | B) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W2_B | B) = 0.3 \)

We are interested in finding \( P(A | W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) \).

First, we need to compute the joint probability of the witnesses' testimonies:

\[ 
P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B | A) = P(W1_A | A) \times P(W2_B | A) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 
\]

\[ 
P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B | B) = P(W1_A | B) \times P(W2_B | B) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 
\]

Now, compute the total probability of \( W1_A \text{ and } W2_B \):

\[ 
P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) = P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B | A) \times P(A) + P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B | B) \times P(B) 
\]

\[ 
P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) = (0.56 \times 0.15) + (0.06 \times 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 
\]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) \):

\[ 
P(A | W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) = \frac{P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B | A) \times P(A)}{P(W1_A \text{ and } W2_B)} 
\]

\[ 
P(A | W1_A \text{ and } W2_B) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622
\]

Therefore:

\[ \{probability: 0.62\} \]
