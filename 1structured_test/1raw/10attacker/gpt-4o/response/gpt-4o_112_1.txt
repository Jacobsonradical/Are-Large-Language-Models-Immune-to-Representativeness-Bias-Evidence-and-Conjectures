To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs with new evidence. 

Let's define the necessary probabilities:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(Tall) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the given population)
   - \( P(Short) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the given population)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - \( P(W1 \,|\ Tall) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person as tall)
   - \( P(W1 \,|\ Short) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker was tall given the first witness's testimony \( P(Tall \,|\ W1) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(Tall \,|\ W1) = \frac{P(W1 \,|\ Tall) \cdot P(Tall)}{P(W1 \,|\ Tall) \cdot P(Tall) + P(W1 \,|\ Short) \cdot P(Short)} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(Tall \,|\ W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(Tall \,|\ W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(Tall \,|\ W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(Tall \,|\ W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as per the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.41.
