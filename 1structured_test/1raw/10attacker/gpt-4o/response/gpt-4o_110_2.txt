To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( T \)) given the conflicting witness statements, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Here's how we can set it up:

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \), the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \), the probability that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Witness Reliability:**
   - The first witness (W1) claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
     - \( P(W1 \mid T) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(W1 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \)
   
   - The second witness (W2) claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
     - \( P(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.70 \)
     - \( P(W2 \mid T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(T \mid W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \), where \( \neg W2 \) means the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayesâ€™ theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2)} \]

First, we find \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid T) \) and \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid \neg T) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid T) = P(W1 \mid T) \cdot P(\neg W2 \mid T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid \neg T) = P(W1 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(T \mid W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \):

\[ P(T \mid W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
