To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{tall} \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{short} \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W1_{tall} | T) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W1_{tall} | S) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(W2_{short} | S) = 0.70 \).
- \( P(W2_{short} | T) = 0.30 \).

We want to compute \( P(T | W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short}) \).

First, calculate \( P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | T) \):

\[ P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | T) = P(W1_{tall} | T) \cdot P(W2_{short} | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24. \]

Next, calculate \( P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | S) \):

\[ P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | S) = P(W1_{tall} | S) \cdot P(W2_{short} | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14. \]

Now, using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short}) = P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | S) \cdot P(S). \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short}) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155. \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short}) = \frac{P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_{tall} \text{ and } W2_{short})} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232. \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
