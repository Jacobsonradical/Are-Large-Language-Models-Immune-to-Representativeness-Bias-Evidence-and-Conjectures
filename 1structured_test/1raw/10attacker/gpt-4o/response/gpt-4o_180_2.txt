Let's define the events for clarity:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we have the following prior probabilities based on the city's population distribution:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)

The accuracy of the witnesses is given as:
- For the first witness:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \)
- For the second witness:
  - \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, i.e., \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \).

We'll use Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability to calculate this:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

First, let's calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | L) \):
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | L) = P(W_1 | L) \cdot P(W_2 | L) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Then, using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | L) \cdot P(L)
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
