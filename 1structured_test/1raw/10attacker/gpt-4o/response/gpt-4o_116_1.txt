To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We are given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Based on the first witness's testimony:
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.8 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.2 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find \( P(H_1 | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

where

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Let's calculate \( P(E_1) \):

\[ P(E_1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(H_1 | E_1) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
