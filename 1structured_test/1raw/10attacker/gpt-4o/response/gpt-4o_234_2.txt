To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (as claimed by the first witness), we can use Bayes' Theorem. According to the theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find \( P(H | W1) \).

**Given values:**
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)

First, we need to calculate \( P(W1) \):

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | W1) \):

\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1)} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.4138.

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
