To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) and \( P(S) = 0.85 \).
2. The first witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time, hence:
   - \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.2 \).
3. The second witness identifies the height correctly 70% of the time, hence:
   - \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.3 \).

We are interested in finding \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Since \( P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) \) and \( P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) \), we plug in the values:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

And:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, compute \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \):

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
