To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we apply Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates current evidence to prior beliefs to calculate the probability of an event. Let's break down the information step-by-step.

First, we denote the following:
- \( T \): Event that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( S \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_S \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_T \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- Prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller: \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- Probability that the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller: \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W1|S) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \)
- Probability that the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)
- Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller: \( P(W2|T) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \)

We aim to calculate \( P(T|W1 \text{ and } W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes’ theorem, we calculate:
\[ P(T|W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

To determine \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2|T) \) and \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2|S) \):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(W2|S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Using the law of total probability for the denominator \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(T|W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = \frac{36}{155} \approx 0.232 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony is approximately \( 0.232 \).
