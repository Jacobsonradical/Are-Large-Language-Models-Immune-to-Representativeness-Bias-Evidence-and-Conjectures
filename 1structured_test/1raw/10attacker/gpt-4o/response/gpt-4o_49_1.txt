Sure, let's solve this problem using Bayes' Theorem.

Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- Probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \).
- Probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \).

Let \( E_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( E_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

For witness 1:
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \).

For witness 2:
- Probability that the witness correctly identifies if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \).
- Probability that the witness incorrectly identifies if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \).

We want to find the probability \( P(H_1 | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witnessâ€™s claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)}
\]

Where \( P(E_1) \) is the total probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Substitute the provided probabilities:
\[
P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Therefore:
\[
P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4138.

Here is the answer in the required format:
\[
\{ probability: 0.4138 \}
\]
