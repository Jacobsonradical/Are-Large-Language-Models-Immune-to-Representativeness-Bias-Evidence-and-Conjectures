We need to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies. We can use Bayes' Theorem for this calculation. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The prior probabilities for these events are derived from the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

For the witnesses:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: \( P(W1\_T|T) = 0.8 \)
- Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time: \( P(W1\_S|T) = 0.2 \)
- Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time: \( P(W2\_S|S) = 0.7 \)
- Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time: \( P(W2\_T|S) = 0.3 \)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. We denote these testimonies as \( W1 = T \) (witness 1 claims attacker is 185 cm or taller) and \( W2 = S \) (witness 2 claims attacker is shorter).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1 = T, W2 = S) = \frac{P(W1 = T, W2 = S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 = T, W2 = S)} \]

We break down the numerator:
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S | T) = P(W1 = T | T) \cdot P(W2 = S | T) \]
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.2 = 0.16 \]

The denominator involves both \( T \) and \( S \):
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S) = P(W1 = T, W2 = S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 = T, W2 = S | S) \cdot P(S) \]

For the component under \( S \):
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S | S) = P(W1 = T | S) \cdot P(W2 = S | S) \]
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S | S) = 0.3 \cdot 0.7 = 0.21 \]

Now, combining these:
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S) = 0.16 \cdot 0.15 + 0.21 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 = T, W2 = S) = 0.024 + 0.1785 = 0.2025 \]

So, the conditional probability:
\[ P(T | W1 = T, W2 = S) = \frac{0.16 \cdot 0.15}{0.2025} \]
\[ P(T | W1 = T, W2 = S) = \frac{0.024}{0.2025} \]
\[ P(T | W1 = T, W2 = S) \approx 0.1185 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.1185}
