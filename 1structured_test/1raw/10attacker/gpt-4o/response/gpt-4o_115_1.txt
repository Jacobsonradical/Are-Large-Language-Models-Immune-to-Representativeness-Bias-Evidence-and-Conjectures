To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims and the probability distributions, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define Events**:
    - Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
    - Let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given Probabilities**:
    - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
    - \( P(W1 | A) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies 80% of the time for 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(W1 | B) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time for shorter than 185 cm)
    - \( P(W2 | A) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies 30% of the time for 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(W2 | B) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies 70% of the time for shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Calculate the Combined Probability of Witnesses' Claims**:
    - Since we need the overall probability given both witnesses, we will calculate the joint probability.

4. **Bayes’ Theorem Setup**:
    \[
    P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)}
    \]

    First, calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \):
    \[
    P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
    \]

    Then, calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) \):
    \[
    P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \cdot P(W2 | B) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14
    \]

5. **Calculate Total Probability**:
    \[
    P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) \cdot P(B) 
    \]
    \[
    P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
    \]

6. **Final Calculation using Bayes’ Theorem**:
    \[
    P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
    \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
