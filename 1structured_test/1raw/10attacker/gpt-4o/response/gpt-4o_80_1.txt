To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (this is 15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (this is 85% or 0.85).
- \( P(E_1 | H) \): Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller (this is 80% or 0.80).
- \( P(E_1 | \neg H) \): Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (this is an error and is 20% or 0.20).

We need to calculate \( P(H | E_1) \): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided by the first witness.

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]

Where \( P(E_1) \), the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is given by:

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we can compute \( P(H | E_1) \):

\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
