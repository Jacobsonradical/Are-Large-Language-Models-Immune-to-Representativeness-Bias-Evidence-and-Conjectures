To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis (the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller) in light of new evidence (the witnesses' testimonies).

Let's define the following events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \)

We seek \( P(H|W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

We calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 | H) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) \) since \( W1 \) and \( W2 \) are conditionally independent given \( H \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(W2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) = P(W1|\neg H) \cdot P(W2|\neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
