Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The prior probabilities given the population data are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

We have two witnesses with given accuracies. For the first witness:
- \( P(W1 \text{ says } H | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 \text{ says } S | H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W1 \text{ says } S | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W1 \text{ says } H | S) = 0.30 \)

For the second witness:
- \( P(W2 \text{ says } S | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W2 \text{ says } H | H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2 \text{ says } S | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2 \text{ says } H | S) = 0.30 \)

Given the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to find \( P(H | W1 \text{ says } H) \). We can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W1 \text{ says } H) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ says } H | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ says } H)} \]

Where \( P(W1 \text{ says } H) \) is the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W1 \text{ says } H) = P(W1 \text{ says } H | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ says } H | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W1 \text{ says } H) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ says } H) = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ says } H) = 0.375 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W1 \text{ says } H) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ says } H) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ says } H) = 0.32 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.32}.
