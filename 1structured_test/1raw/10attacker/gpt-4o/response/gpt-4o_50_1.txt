To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayesian inference.

First, we need to define the following events:
- \( H = \text{attacker is 185 cm or taller} \)
- \( L = \text{attacker is shorter than 185 cm} \)

Given:
- Prior probabilities: 
  - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(L) = 0.85 \)

- Likelihoods based on witnesses:
  - First witness (W1) claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller:
    - \( P(W1 \text{ says taller} \mid H) = 0.80 \)
    - \( P(W1 \text{ says taller} \mid L) = 0.20 \)
  - Second witness (W2) claims the attacker was shorter:
    - \( P(W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid L) = 0.70 \)
    - \( P(W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid H) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(H \mid W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter}) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter})}
\]

To simplify this, let's use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter}) = P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid L) \cdot P(L)
\]

Now, calculate the terms:

\[
P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid H) = P(W1 \text{ says taller} \mid H) \cdot P(W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid L) = P(W1 \text{ says taller} \mid L) \cdot P(W2 \text{ says shorter} \mid L) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W1 \text{ says taller}, W2 \text{ says shorter}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the probability estimate is:
\[
\{probability: 0.232\}
\]
