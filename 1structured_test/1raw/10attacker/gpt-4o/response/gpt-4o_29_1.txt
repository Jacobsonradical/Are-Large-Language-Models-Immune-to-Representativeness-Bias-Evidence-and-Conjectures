To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the information we have:

- The first witness claims the attacker had been 185 cm or taller.
- The probability of the first witness correctly identifying a height of 185 cm or taller is 80% (0.8).
- The probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter than 185 cm as taller is 20% (0.2).
- The base rates are that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness says the height is 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(T | W1) \):

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \) (first witness correctly identifies height of 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W1 | S) = 0.2 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies height shorter than 185 cm as taller)

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) (total probability of the first witness saying the height is 185 cm or taller) is calculated as:

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T | W1) \):

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.414 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
