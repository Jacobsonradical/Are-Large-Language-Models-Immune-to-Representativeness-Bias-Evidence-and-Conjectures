Let's use Bayesian probability to determine the likelihood that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given witness information.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From information "a":
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

From information "b":
- The first witness correctly identifies \[ P(\text{correct} \mid H) = 0.80 \]
- The first witness errs \[ P(\text{incorrect} \mid S) = 0.20 \]
- The second witness correctly identifies \[ P(\text{correct} \mid S) = 0.70 \]
- The second witness errs \[ P(\text{incorrect} \mid H) = 0.30 \]

However, only the first witness's claim is relevant to the problem's request. To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid C) = \frac{P(C \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(C)} \]

Where \( C \) is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

The probability of the claim \( C \):
\[ P(C) = P(C \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(C \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]

Given:
\[ P(C \mid H) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(C \mid S) = 0.30 \] (Since if the attacker is shorter, the witness incorrectly claims they are taller)

So,
\[ P(C) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.30 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375 \]

Using these,
\[ P(H \mid C) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.375} = \frac{0.12}{0.375} = 0.32 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is:

\[ {probability: 0.32} \]
