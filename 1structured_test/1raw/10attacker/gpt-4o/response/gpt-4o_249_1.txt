We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and the population statistics. 

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \).

First, we use the prior probabilities:
- Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller (\( P(H_1) \)): 0.15
- Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(H_2) \)): 0.85

Next, we use the witnesses' reliability:

For the first witness:
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)

For the second witness:
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

By Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, is:

\[
P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Since \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are independent given \( H_1 \) or \( H_2 \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

\[
\{probability: 0.232\}
\]
