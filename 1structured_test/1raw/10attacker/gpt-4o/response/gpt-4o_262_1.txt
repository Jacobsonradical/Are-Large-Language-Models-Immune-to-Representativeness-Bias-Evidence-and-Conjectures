To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We know the following:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller = 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(\lnot A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm = 85%, or 0.85.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker who is 185 cm or taller = 80%, or 0.8.
- \( P(B|\lnot A) \) is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller = 20%, or 0.2.

We need to find \( P(B) \), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\lnot A)P(\lnot A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim, is:

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
