To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the available information, we will use Bayes' Theorem. 

### Known Information:

1. **Prior Probability**:
    - 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm → \( P(Short) = 0.85 \)
    - 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller → \( P(Tall) = 0.15 \)

2. **Witness Testimonies**:

    **First Witness**:
    - Correctly identifies tall people (≥ 185 cm) 80% of the time → \( P(\text{Correct Tall} | Tall) = 0.80 \)
    - Incorrectly identifies tall people as short (< 185 cm) 20% of the time → \( P(\text{Incorrect Short} | Tall) = 0.20 \)

    - Correctly identifies short people (< 185 cm) 80% of the time → \( P(\text{Correct Short} | Short) = 0.80 \)
    - Incorrectly identifies short people as tall (≥ 185 cm) 20% of the time → \( P(\text{Incorrect Tall} | Short) = 0.20 \)

    **Second Witness**:
    - Correctly identifies tall people (≥ 185 cm) 70% of the time → \( P(\text{Correct Tall} | Tall) = 0.70 \)
    - Incorrectly identifies tall people as short (< 185 cm) 30% of the time → \( P(\text{Incorrect Short} | Tall) = 0.30 \)

    - Correctly identifies short people (< 185 cm) 70% of the time → \( P(\text{Correct Short} | Short) = 0.70 \)
    - Incorrectly identifies short people as tall (≥ 185 cm) 30% of the time → \( P(\text{Incorrect Tall} | Short) = 0.30 \)

### Applying Bayes' Theorem:

We are asked to estimate the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim that the attacker is tall. Let's denote:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is tall (≥ 185 cm).
- \( S \): The event that the attacker is short (< 185 cm).
- \( W1_T \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is tall.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate \( P(T | W1_T) \) as follows:

\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1_T) \):

\[ P(W1_T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Plugging in the known values:

\[ P(W1_T) = P(\text{Correct Tall} | Tall) \cdot P(T) + P(\text{Incorrect Tall} | Short) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_T) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T | W1_T) \):

\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T)} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T) \approx 0.414 \]

### Final Answer:

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
