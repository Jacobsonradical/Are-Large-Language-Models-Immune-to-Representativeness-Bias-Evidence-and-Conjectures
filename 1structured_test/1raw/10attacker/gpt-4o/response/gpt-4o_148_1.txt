To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claims, is:
