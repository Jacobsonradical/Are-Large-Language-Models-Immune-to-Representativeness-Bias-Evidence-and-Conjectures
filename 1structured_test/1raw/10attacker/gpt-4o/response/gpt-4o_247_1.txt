To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and the population data, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem formula is:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) given evidence \( E \).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence \( E \) given that the hypothesis \( H \) is true.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis \( H \) being true.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal probability of the evidence \( E \).

Let's denote the following:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims it.

First, we calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.4138 \} \]
