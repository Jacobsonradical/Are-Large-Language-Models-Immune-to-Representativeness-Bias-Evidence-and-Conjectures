To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

We also have the reliability of the witnesses:
- First witness:
  - Correct identification if \( T \): 80%, i.e., \( P(W1=T|T) = 0.8 \)
  - Wrong identification if \( S \): 20%, i.e., \( P(W1=T|S) = 0.2 \)
- Second witness:
  - Correct identification if \( S \): 70%, i.e., \( P(W2=S|S) = 0.7 \)
  - Wrong identification if \( T \): 30%, i.e., \( P(W2=S|T) = 0.3 \)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm given the first witnessâ€™s claim, denoted as \( P(T|W1=T) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1=T) = \frac{P(W1=T|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1=T)} \]

To find \( P(W1=T) \):
\[ P(W1=T) = P(W1=T|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1=T|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1=T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1=T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1=T) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating \( P(T|W1=T) \):
\[ P(T|W1=T) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1=T) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1=T) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
