To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s a breakdown of the given information and the steps to solve it:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \(A_1\): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(A_2\): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \(W_1\): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(W_2\): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \(P(A_1) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
   - \(P(A_2) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \(P(W_1 | A_1) = 0.80\) (First witness accurately identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
   - \(P(W_1 | A_2) = 0.20\) (First witness errors in identifying shorter person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
   - \(P(W_2 | A_1) = 0.30\) (Second witness errors in identifying 185 cm or taller person as shorter 30% of the time).
   - \(P(W_2 | A_2) = 0.70\) (Second witness accurately identifies shorter person 70% of the time).

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**
   We want to find \(P(A_1 | W_1)\):

   \[
   P(A_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(W_1)}
   \]

   First calculate \(P(W_1)\):

   \[
   P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(W_1 | A_2) \cdot P(A_2)
   \]

   \[
   P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
   \]

   \[
   P(W_1) = (0.12) + (0.17)
   \]

   \[
   P(W_1) = 0.29
   \]

   Now calculate \(P(A_1 | W_1)\):

   \[
   P(A_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
   \]

   \[
   P(A_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
   \]

   \[
   P(A_1 | W_1) \approx 0.4138 
   \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore:

\{probability: 0.414\}
