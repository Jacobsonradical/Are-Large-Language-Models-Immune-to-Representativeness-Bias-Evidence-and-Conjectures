Given the witness accuracy rates and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller.

Bayes' theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using the data:

1. \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.80.
2. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
3. \( P(B|A') \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.20.

We need to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

So using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
