To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' theorem. We'll define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

First, we need the following probabilities:

1. \( P(A) \) : The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(B) \) : The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(W_1 \mid A) \) : The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(W_1 \mid B) \) : The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid B) = 0.20 \)

Now, we can compute \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid A)P(A) + P(W_1 \mid B)P(B)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.29
\]

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid A)P(A)}{P(W_1)}
\]
\[
P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A \mid W_1) \approx 0.414
\]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
