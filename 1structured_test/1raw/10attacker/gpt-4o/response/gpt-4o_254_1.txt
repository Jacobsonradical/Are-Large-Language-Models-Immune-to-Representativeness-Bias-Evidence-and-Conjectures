To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in \( P(A \mid W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims this.

We know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 \mid A) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 \mid B) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A \mid W1) = \frac{P(W1 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)} \]

We need \( P(W1) \):

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(A \mid W1) \):

\[ P(A \mid W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
