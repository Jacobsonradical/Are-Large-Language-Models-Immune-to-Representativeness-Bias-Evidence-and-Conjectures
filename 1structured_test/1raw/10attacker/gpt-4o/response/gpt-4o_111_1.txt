To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem.

Given the information:
1. 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
2. First witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time (and incorrectly 20% of the time), and the second witness identifies the height correctly 70% of the time (and incorrectly 30% of the time).
3. One witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the other witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the statement by the first witness.
- \( W_2 \) be the statement by the second witness.

We can use the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.70 \)

We want to estimate \( P(H | W_1) \) which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability of the first witness's statement:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) â‰ˆ 0.414 \]

Based on the provided information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
