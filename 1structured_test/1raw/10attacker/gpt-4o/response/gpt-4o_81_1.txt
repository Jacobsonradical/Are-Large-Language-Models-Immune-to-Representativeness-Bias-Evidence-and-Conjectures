To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence. Let's denote:

- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the problem, we have:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
  - \(P(H_2) = 0.85\)
  
- The reliability of the witnesses:
  - \(P(W_1|H_1) = 0.80\)
  - \(P(W_1|H_2) = 0.20\)
  - \(P(W_2|H_2) = 0.70\)
  - \(P(W_2|H_1) = 0.30\)

We are interested in determining the posterior probability \(P(H_1|W_1, W_2)\) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

First, we need to calculate the joint likelihood of both witnesses' statements:

\[ P(W_1, W_2|H_1) = P(W_1|H_1) \times P(W_2|H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2|H_2) = P(W_1|H_2) \times P(W_2|H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate the total probability of the witnesses' statements using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2|H_2) \times P(H_2) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_1|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(H_1|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
