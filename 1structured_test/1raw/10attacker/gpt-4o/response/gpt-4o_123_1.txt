To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we should use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker has a height of 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, let's define the necessary probabilities:

- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a person from the population is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(B|A) \) = Probability that the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually 185 cm or taller.
\[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]
- \( P(\neg A) \) = Probability that a person from the population is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- \( P(B|\neg A) \) = Probability that the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm.
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \]

Now, we need to find \( P(B) \), the total probability that the first witness identifies a person as 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.41} \} \]
