To solve this, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are looking for \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

We can use Bayes' theorem to calculate this:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, let's find \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \):

- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)

Since the witnesses' errors are independent,
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \times P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, let's find \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) \):

- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

Again, since the witnesses' errors are independent,
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \times P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we need the prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \):

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, let's calculate the denominator \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
