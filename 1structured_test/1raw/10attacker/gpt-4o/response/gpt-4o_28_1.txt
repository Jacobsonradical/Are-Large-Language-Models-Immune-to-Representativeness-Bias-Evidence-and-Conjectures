To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here are the steps involved in the calculation:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1^T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2^S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \): Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \): Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W_1^T | T) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W_1^T | S) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter as 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W_2^S | S) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W_2^S | T) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter.

3. **Calculate \( P(W_1^T \) and \( W_2^S ) \):**

   Using the law of total probability, we find the joint probability of the witnesses' statements.

   \( P(W_1^T, W_2^S) = P(W_1^T, W_2^S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1^T, W_2^S | S) \cdot P(S) \)

   Since the witnesses' assessments are independent:

   \( P(W_1^T, W_2^S | T) = P(W_1^T | T) \cdot P(W_2^S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)

   \( P(W_1^T, W_2^S | S) = P(W_1^T | S) \cdot P(W_2^S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

   Therefore:

   \( P(W_1^T, W_2^S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\)

4. **Calculate the Posterior Probability \( P(T | W_1^T, W_2^S) \):**

   By Bayes' theorem:

   \( P(T | W_1^T, W_2^S) = \frac{P(W_1^T, W_2^S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1^T, W_2^S)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232\)

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \( P(T | W_1^T, W_2^S) \approx 0.232 \).

So, we answer:

{probability: 0.232}
