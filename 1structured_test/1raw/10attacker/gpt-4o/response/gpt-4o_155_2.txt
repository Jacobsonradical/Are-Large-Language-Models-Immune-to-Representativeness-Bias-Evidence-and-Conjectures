To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Here are the steps to calculate this probability:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( T \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( T' \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1 \): First witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2 \): Second witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller. (We actually don't need this to answer the current question about the first witness.)

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(T') = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
   
   For the first witness:
   - The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they actually are (\( P(W1|T) \)): 80% or 0.8
   - The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller if they are not (\( P(W1|T') \)): 20% or 0.2

3. **Calculate \( P(W1) \):**
   The total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W1) = P(W1|T) \times P(T) + P(W1|T') \times P(T')
   \]
   \[
   P(W1) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
   \]
   \[
   P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
   Bayes' theorem allows us to find the desired probability \( P(T|W1) \):
   \[
   P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \times P(T)}{P(W1)}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
   \]
   \[
   P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
   \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
