To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( H \geq 185 \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H < 185 \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in \( P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

We will use Bayes' theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H \geq 185) P(H \geq 185)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

We need to calculate each term in this formula.

### Step 1: Prior probabilities
- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \)

### Step 2: Likelihoods
- \( P(W1 | H \geq 185) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies taller person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 | H < 185) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter person as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W2 | H \geq 185) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies taller person as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2 | H < 185) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter person 70% of the time)

### Step 3: Joint likelihoods
- \( P(W1, W2 | H \geq 185) = P(W1 | H \geq 185) \cdot P(W2 | H \geq 185) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1, W2 | H < 185) = P(W1 | H < 185) \cdot P(W2 | H < 185) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

### Step 4: Total probability of \(W1, W2\)
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H \geq 185) P(H \geq 185) + P(W1, W2 | H < 185) P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

### Step 5: Posterior probability
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H \geq 185) P(H \geq 185)}{P(W1, W2)} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | W1, W2) \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.2323 \} \]
