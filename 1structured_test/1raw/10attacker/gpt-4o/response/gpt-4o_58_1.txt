To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of stochastic events. Given our problem, we want to calculate \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \), where:

- \( H \) is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_1 \) is the testimony of the first witness.
- \( E_2 \) is the testimony of the second witness.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E_1, E_2 | H) \) is the probability of the testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E_1, E_2) \) is the total probability of the testimonies.

We already have the following probabilities from the problem description:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (where \( \neg H \) is the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

First, calculate \( P(E_1, E_2 | H) \):
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(E_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we can find \( P(E_1, E_2) \):
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed:
\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
