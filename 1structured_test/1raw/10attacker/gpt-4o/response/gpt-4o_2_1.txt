To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 \): The first witness's testimony (185 cm or taller)
- \( W2 \): The second witness's testimony (shorter than 185 cm)

We know the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \), the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \), the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1 \mid H) = 0.80 \), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2 \mid H) = 0.30 \), the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \), the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can find \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

First, let's calculate the joint probability for both witness testimonies given the height:
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \cdot P(W2 \mid H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) = P(W1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)} \]

Let's substitute the values:
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85} \]
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Hence the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
