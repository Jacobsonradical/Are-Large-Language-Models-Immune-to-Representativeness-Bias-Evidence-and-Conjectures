To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the data:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

For the first witness:

- \( P(W_1 \mid H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H_2) = 0.20 \)

For the second witness:

- \( P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.70 \)

We want to find the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements. Let's denote:

- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) = P(W_1 \mid H_1) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H_1) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) = P(W_1 \mid H_2) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H_2) \]

Given the data:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now compute \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
