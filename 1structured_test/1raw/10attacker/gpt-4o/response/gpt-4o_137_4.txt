To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Below are the variables and computations involved:

- \( P(\text{Tall}) \): The prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(\text{Short}) \): The prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

- For the first witness (who said the attacker was tall):
  - \( P(\text{Tall} | W1) \): Probability that the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony
  - \( P(W1 | \text{Tall}) \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person = 0.80
  - \( P(W1 | \text{Short}) \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall (error rate) = 0.20

- For the second witness (who said the attacker was short):
  - \( P(\text{Short} | W2) \): Probability that the attacker is short given the second witness's testimony
  - \( P(W2 | \text{Tall}) \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short (error rate) = 0.30
  - \( P(W2 | \text{Short}) \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short person = 0.70

First, we calculate the combined likelihood for each height category:

1. **Tall**:
\[ P(\text{Tall and W1 and W2}) = P(\text{Tall}) \cdot P(W1 | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(W2 | \text{Tall}) \]
\[ P(\text{Tall and W1 and W2}) = 0.15 \cdot 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.036 \]

2. **Short**:
\[ P(\text{Short and W1 and W2}) = P(\text{Short}) \cdot P(W1 | \text{Short}) \cdot P(W2 | \text{Short}) \]
\[ P(\text{Short and W1 and W2}) = 0.85 \cdot 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.119 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(\text{Tall} | W1 \text{ and } W2) \):

\[ P(\text{Tall} | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(\text{Tall and W1 and W2})}{P(\text{Tall and W1 and W2}) + P(\text{Short and W1 and W2})} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

The probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
