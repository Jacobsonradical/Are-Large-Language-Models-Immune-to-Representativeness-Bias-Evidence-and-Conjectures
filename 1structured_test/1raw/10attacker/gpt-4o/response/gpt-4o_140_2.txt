To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T^c \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \) as the evidence from the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) as the evidence from the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(T | E_1, E_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

However, since \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) provide conditional testimonies based on whether \( T \) or \( T^c \):

First, let's break \( P(E_1, E_2) \) down using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(E_1, E_2 | T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E_1 | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E_1 | T^c) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E_2 | T^c) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E_2 | T) = 0.3 \)

Assuming the witnessesâ€™ testimonies are independent, we can write:

\[ P(E_1, E_2 | T) = P(E_1 | T) \cdot P(E_2 | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | T^c) = P(E_1 | T^c) \cdot P(E_2 | T^c) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(E1, E2) \):

\[ P(E1, E2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(E_1, E_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
