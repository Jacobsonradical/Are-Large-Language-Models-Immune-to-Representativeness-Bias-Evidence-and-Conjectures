To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (P(185 cm or taller | witnesses' statements)), we will use Bayes' theorem. We need to consider the two statements from the witnesses and the general population statistics.

Let's define the following:
- \(T\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(S\): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\): The first witness's statement (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(W_2\): The second witness's statement (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The witnesses' accuracies:
- \(P(W_1 | T) = 0.8\)
- \(P(W_1 | S) = 0.2\)
- \(P(W_2 | T) = 0.3\)
- \(P(W_2 | S) = 0.7\)

The prior probabilities given by the city's population distribution:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(S) = 0.85\)

We need to calculate:
- \(P(T | W_1, W_2)\): The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Since the witnesses are independent:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The law of total probability for \(P(W_1, W_2)\):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.2323 \} \]
