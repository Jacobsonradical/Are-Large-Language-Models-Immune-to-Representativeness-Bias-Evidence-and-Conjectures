We will use Bayes’ theorem to solve this problem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( H^c \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We need to compute the probability \( P(H | W_1) \), where \( W_1 \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

We need to find \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given all possible heights. We can break this down using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]

From the given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is so)
- \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter)

Now we can find \( P(W_1) \):
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.29
\]

Next, we use Bayes’ theorem to find \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(H | W_1) \approx 0.414
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
