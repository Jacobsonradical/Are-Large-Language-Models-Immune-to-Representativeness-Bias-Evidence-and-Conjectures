To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Let's define the events:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the provided information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1|H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2|H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2|H_2) = 0.70 \)

We need to find the combined probability of both witnesses' claims given the height hypothesis. We are interested in \( P(H_1|W_1 \cap W_2) \). 

To achieve this, we use the product of the likelihoods of each witness conditioned on the height, and apply Bayes' rule:

\[ P(H_1|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) is the total probability of the witness statements:

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_2) P(H_2) \]

Calculating \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_1) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_1) = P(W_1|H_1) P(W_2|H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2|H_2) = P(W_1|H_2) P(W_2|H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we compute the total probability of the witness statements:

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
