To estimate the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the witnesses and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

The witnesses' accuracy levels provide conditional probabilities:
- Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the first witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time: \( P(W1 = T | T) = 0.80 \)
- Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the first witness incorrectly identifies this as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: \( P(W1 = T | S) = 0.20 \)
- Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the second witness correctly identifies this 70% of the time: \( P(W2 = S | S) = 0.70 \)
- Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the second witness incorrectly identifies this as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time: \( P(W2 = S | T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(T | \text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) \]

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | \text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) = \frac{P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S})} \]

First, calculate \( P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | T) \):
\[ P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | T) = P(W1 = T | T) \cdot P(W2 = S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | S) \):
\[ P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | S) = P(W1 = T | S) \cdot P(W2 = S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the marginal probability \( P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) \):
\[ P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) = P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S} | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(\text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(T | \text{W1 says T and W2 says S}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
