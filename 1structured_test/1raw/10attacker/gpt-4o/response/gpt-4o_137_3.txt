We can tackle this problem using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence. In this case, we're trying to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given this, we are interested in finding \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \).

Based on the problem details:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

The witnesses' accuracy details are as follows:
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies tall attacker)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (First witness mistakenly identifies short attacker as tall)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \) (Second witness mistakenly identifies tall attacker as short)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies short attacker)

Applying Bayes' theorem, we need to update the probabilities based on the given evidence:

The likelihood of both witnesses' statements if the attacker is tall:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \times P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

The likelihood of both witnesses' statements if the attacker is short:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \times P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

We can now calculate the posterior probabilities using these:

Normalize the probabilities using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
