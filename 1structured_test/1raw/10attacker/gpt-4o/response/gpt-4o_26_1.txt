Let's denote the events as follows:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- Probability that the first witness is correct: \( P(W_1 \mid H_1) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1 \mid H_2) = 0.20 \)
- Probability that the second witness is correct: \( P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.70 \) and \( P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.30 \)

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this. This is calculated using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ 
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]
\[ 
P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[ 
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 \mid W_1) \):

\[ 
P(H_1 \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
