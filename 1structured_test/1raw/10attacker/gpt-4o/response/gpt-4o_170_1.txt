To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims, we can use Bayesian inference.

We define:
- \( T \): The attacker's height (\( T = 1 \) if 185 cm or taller, \( T = 0 \) if shorter than 185 cm)
- \( W_1 \): The first witness's claim (\( W_1 = 1 \) if claims 185 cm or taller, \( W_1 = 0 \) if claims shorter)
- \( W_2 \): The second witness's claim (\( W_2 = 1 \) if claims 185 cm or taller, \( W_2 = 0 \) if claims shorter)

From the problem:
- \( P(T = 1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T = 0) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 = 1 | T = 1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 = 0 | T = 1) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_1 = 1 | T = 0) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_1 = 0 | T = 0) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_2 = 1 | T = 1) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 = 0 | T = 1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 = 1 | T = 0) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 = 0 | T = 0) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(T = 1 | W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T = 1 | W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) = \frac{P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T = 1) P(T = 1)}{P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0)} \]

The term \( P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) = P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T = 1) P(T = 1) + P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T = 0) P(T = 0) \]

Breaking down \( P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T) \):
\[ P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T = 1) = P(W_1 = 1 | T = 1) P(W_2 = 0 | T = 1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0 | T = 0) = P(W_1 = 1 | T = 0) P(W_2 = 0 | T = 0) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now plug these back in:
\[ P(W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, plug this into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T = 1 | W_1 = 1, W_2 = 0) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' claims, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
