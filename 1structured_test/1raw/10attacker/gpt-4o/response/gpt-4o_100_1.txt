To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information:

- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\) (prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(H_2) = 0.85\) (prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80\) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20\) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30\) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70\) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find the posterior probability \(P(H_1 | E_1E_2)\), i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1 E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 E_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1 E_2)} \]

First, let's calculate \(P(E_1 E_2 | H_1)\) and \(P(E_1 E_2 | H_2)\):

\[ P(E_1 E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(E_1 E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we need the marginal probability \(P(E_1 E_2)\):

\[ P(E_1 E_2) = P(E_1 E_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E_1 E_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]

\[ P(E_1 E_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]

\[ P(E_1 E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(H_1 | E_1 E_2)\):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1 E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H_1 | E_1 E_2) \approx 0.23226 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
