To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony, we use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(T') = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T') = 0.20 \)

To find \( P(W_1) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | T') \cdot P(T') \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W_1) \):
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
