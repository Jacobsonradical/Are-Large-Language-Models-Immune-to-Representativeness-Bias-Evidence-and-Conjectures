To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided by the witnesses and the general population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( H \), and the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as \( \neg H \).

Let's denote:
- \( W_1 \): the claim of the first witness (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( W_2 \): the claim of the second witness (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (probability the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

First, calculate the individual components:
1. The likelihood of both witnesses' claims given \( H \) (attacker is 185 cm or taller):
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
   \]

2. The likelihood of both witnesses' claims given \( \neg H \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
   \]

3. The total likelihood of both witnesses' claims:
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims and the prior population distribution, is around 0.232.
