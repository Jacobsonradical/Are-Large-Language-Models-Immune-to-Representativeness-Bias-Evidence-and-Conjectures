To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( L \) represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively.

Given:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness Accuracy:

- For the first witness (\( W_1 \)):
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (identifies correctly if 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.2 \) (identifies incorrectly if shorter than 185 cm)
  
- For the second witness (\( W_2 \)):
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (identifies incorrectly if 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.7 \) (identifies correctly if shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1 \text{ says } H, W_2 \text{ says } L) \).

First, we calculate the joint probability of the witnesses' statements given the two scenarios \( H \) and \( L \):

1. Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L | H) = P(W_1 \text{ says } H | H) \cdot P(W_2 \text{ says } L | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
   \]

2. Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L | L) = P(W_1 \text{ says } H | L) \cdot P(W_2 \text{ says } L | L) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
   \]

Next, we calculate the total probability of \( W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L \):

\[
P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L) = P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L | L) \cdot P(L)
\]

\[
= (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \text{ says } H \text{ and } W_2 \text{ says } L)}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{ \mathbf{probability: 0.232} \}
\]
