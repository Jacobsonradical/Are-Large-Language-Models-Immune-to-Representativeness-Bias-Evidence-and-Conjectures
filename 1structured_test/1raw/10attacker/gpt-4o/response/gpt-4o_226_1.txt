To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (The prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (The prior probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)
5. \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (The probability that the second witness correctly identifies a shorter person)
6. \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as a shorter person)

Now we want to find the conditional probability \( P(T | W1) \), where \( W1 \) represents the event that the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W1) \) (the total probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as taller):

\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W1) \):

\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
