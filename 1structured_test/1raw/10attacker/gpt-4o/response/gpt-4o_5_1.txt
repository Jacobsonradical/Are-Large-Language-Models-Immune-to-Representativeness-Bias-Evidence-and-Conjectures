To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem to combine the prior probability with the likelihood of the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's define:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | B) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

First, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)}
\]

Since \( W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \) are independent conditioned on the height of the attacker, we have:

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A)
\]
\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) = P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(W_2 | B)
\]

Next, we need the total probability \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substituting values, we get:

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, compute \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{probability: 0.232\}
\]
