Let's use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the claims of both witnesses and the prior probabilities of height in the population.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- P(T) = 0.15
- P(S) = 0.85
- P(W1_T \| T) = 0.8
- P(W1_T \| S) = 0.2
- P(W2_S \| T) = 0.3
- P(W2_S \| S) = 0.7

We want to calculate the posterior probability P(T \| W1_T, W2_S).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \| W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \| T) \cdot P(W2_S \| T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W1_T, W2_S) \):

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S \| T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S \| S) \cdot P(S) \]

Where:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S \| T) = P(W1_T \| T) \cdot P(W2_S \| T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S \| S) = P(W1_T \| S) \cdot P(W2_S \| S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.155 \]

Now, we can plug this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \| W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T \| W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
