To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimony and population data, we can apply Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior probabilities based on new evidence. Let's start by defining the events and applying Bayes' theorem step-by-step.

We want to find \( P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed they were.

### Given Data:

- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm)

Success rates (likelihood) for witnesses:
- First Witness:
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H < 185) = 0.20 \)
- Second Witness (not directly used here, but useful for consistency):
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H < 185) = 0.70 \)

### Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where the marginal probability \( P(W_1) \) can be expanded as:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W_1 \mid H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

### Calculation:

1. **Calculate the denominator \( P(W_1) \):**

\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W_1) = (0.12) + (0.17) = 0.29
\]

2. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**

\[
P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

### Final Estimate:

{ probability: 0.4138 }
