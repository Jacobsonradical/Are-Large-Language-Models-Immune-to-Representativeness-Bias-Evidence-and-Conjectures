To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which incorporates the witnesses' accuracy and the base rate from the population data.

Here are the givens:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

The first witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W1|\geq 185) \): Probability the first witness says \(\geq 185\) given true height \(\geq 185\) = 0.80
- \( P(W1|< 185) \): Probability the first witness says \(\geq 185\) given true height < 185 = 0.20

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(\geq 185|W1) \): Probability the attacker is \(\geq 185\) given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\geq 185|W1) = \frac{P(W1|\geq 185) \cdot P(\geq 185)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability that the first witness says \(\geq 185\):
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|\geq 185) \cdot P(\geq 185) + P(W1|< 185) \cdot P(< 185) \]

Now, we substitute the values:
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(\geq 185|W1) \):
\[ P(\geq 185|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\geq 185|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\geq 185|W1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
