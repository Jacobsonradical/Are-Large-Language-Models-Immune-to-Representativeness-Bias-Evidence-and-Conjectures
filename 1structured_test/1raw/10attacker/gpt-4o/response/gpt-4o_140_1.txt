To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(T|W1 \wedge W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

### Step 1: Base Rates
From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

### Step 2: Witness Accuracy
The accuracy of the witnesses:
- The first witness correctly identifies an attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies them 20% of the time.
  - \( P(W1|T) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W1|\neg T) = 0.2 \)
- The second witness correctly identifies an attacker as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and incorrectly identifies them 30% of the time.
  - \( P(W2|\neg T) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(W2|T) = 0.3 \)

### Step 3: Calculate Joint Probabilities
Let's use the Law of Total Probability to calculate \( P(W1 \wedge W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \wedge W2) = P(W1 \wedge W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \wedge W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 \wedge W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1 \wedge W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

So,

\[ P(W1 \wedge W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

### Step 4: Apply Bayes' Theorem
Now, we can find \( P(T | W1 \wedge W2) \):

\[ P(T | W1 \wedge W2) = \frac{P(W1 \wedge W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \wedge W2)} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(T | W1 \wedge W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.2323 \} \]
