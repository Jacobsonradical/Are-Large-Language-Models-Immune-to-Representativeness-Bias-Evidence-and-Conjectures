To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{H} \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_{L} \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_{H} \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{L} \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_{H} | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1_{L} | L) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W1_{H} | L) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W1_{L} | H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2_{H} | H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2_{L} | L) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2_{H} | L) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2_{L} | H) = 0.70 \)

We want to calculate \( P(H | W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) = \frac{P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L})} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | H) \) and \( P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | L) \):
\[ P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | H) = P(W1_{H} | H) \cdot P(W2_{L} | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.70 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | L) = P(W1_{H} | L) \cdot P(W2_{L} | L) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate the total probability of the evidence \( P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) = P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L} | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) = 0.56 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.119 = 0.203 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) \):
\[ P(H | W1_{H} \cap W2_{L}) = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.203} = \frac{0.084}{0.203} \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.

\(\boxed{probability: 0.414}\)
