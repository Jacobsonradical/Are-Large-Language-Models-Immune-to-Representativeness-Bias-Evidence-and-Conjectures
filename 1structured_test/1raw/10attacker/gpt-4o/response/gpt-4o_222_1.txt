To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The true event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The true event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_S \): Witness 1 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_T \): Witness 2 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we have:
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(T) = 0.15 \).
- Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(S) = 0.85 \).
- Probability of witness 1 correctly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller: \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \).
- Probability of witness 1 incorrectly identifying the attacker as 185 cm or taller: \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \).
- Probability of witness 2 correctly identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \).
- Probability of witness 2 incorrectly identifying the attacker as shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \).

We want to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | T) P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

To find \( P(W1_T, W2_S) \):
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | T) P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) P(S) \]

We have:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.232}
