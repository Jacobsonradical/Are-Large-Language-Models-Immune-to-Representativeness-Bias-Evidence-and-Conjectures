To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims this.

Given information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time for \( H_1 \))
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time for \( H_2 \))

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

To calculate \( P(W_1) \):

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Then,
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
