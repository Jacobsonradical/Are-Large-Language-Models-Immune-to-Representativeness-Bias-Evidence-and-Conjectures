To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witness testimonies and the general population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote the events as follows:
- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(S\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(S) = 0.85\) (the probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(W_1 | T) = 0.80\) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W_1 | S) = 0.20\) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(W_2 | S) = 0.70\) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(W_2 | T) = 0.30\) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \(P(T | W_1)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)}
\]
where \(P(W_1)\) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \(P(T | W_1)\):
\[
P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[
{probability: 0.4138}
\]
