To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let's define the following variables:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | \text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) \).

Given:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
  
- Likelihoods:
  - The first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time: \( P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller} | H_1) = 0.80 \)
  - The first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time: \( P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller} | H_2) = 0.20 \)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | \text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) = \frac{P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller} | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller})} \]

We need to calculate \( P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) \):

\[
P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) = P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller} | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller} | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
P(\text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, calculate the posterior probability:

\[
P(H_1 | \text{first witness claims 185 cm or taller}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

\{probability: 0.414\}
