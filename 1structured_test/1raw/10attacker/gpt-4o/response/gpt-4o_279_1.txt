To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We'll update our belief about the height of the attacker given the witnesses' testimonies and the prior probability of heights in the population.

First, let's denote:

- \( H \geq 185 \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H < 185 \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We'll use Bayes' theorem, which states:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, \text{witness statements}) = \frac{P(\text{witness statements} \,|\, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(\text{witness statements})} \]

Where:

- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (prior probability from population statistics)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote the witness statements by \( W_1 \) (first witness) and \( W_2 \) (second witness). Therefore:

- \( P(W_1 \,|\, H \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \,|\, H < 185) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \,|\, H < 185) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 \,|\, H \geq 185) = 0.30 \)

Using these, we can combine the probabilities of the witnesses:

1. Calculate the likelihood of the witnesses’ statements given the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \,|\, H \geq 185) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. Calculate the likelihood of the witnesses’ statements given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \,|\, H < 185) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we need the total probability of the witness statements:

\[ P(\text{witness statements}) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \,|\, H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \,|\, H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]

\[ P(\text{witness statements}) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(\text{witness statements}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, \text{witness statements}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H \geq 185 \,|\, \text{witness statements}) \approx 0.232 \]

So,

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
