To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's statements and the prior probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Additionally, given the conditions, the witnesses' abilities to correctly identify the height of a person are provided:
- First witness: 
  - \( P(E_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(E_1 | B) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm)
  
- Second witness: 
  - \( P(E_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(E_2 | B) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in \( P(A | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E_1)} \]

where \( P(E_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness's statement being true:

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(E_1 | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(A | E_1) \):

\[ P(A | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.414}
