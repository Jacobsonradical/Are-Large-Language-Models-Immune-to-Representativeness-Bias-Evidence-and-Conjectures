To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate \( P(H_1 | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

First, we need the following probabilities:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller, from \( b \))
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm, from \( b \))
  
From the accuracy of the witnesses:

- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

\( P(E_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
