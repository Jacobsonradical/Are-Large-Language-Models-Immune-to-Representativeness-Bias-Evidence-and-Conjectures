To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

First, let's establish the base rates and witness accuracy:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (The proportion of people who are 185 cm or taller in the city)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (The proportion of people who are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies tall attackers 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 \mid S) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies short attackers as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies tall attackers as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2 \mid S) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies short attackers 70% of the time)

We'll follow these steps to apply Bayes' Theorem for multiple pieces of evidence (witnesses):

1. Calculate the likelihoods:
    - \( P(W1, W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \times P(W2 \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
    - \( P(W1, W2 \mid S) = P(W1 \mid S) \times P(W2 \mid S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

2. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where \( P(W1, W2) \) is the total probability of the witnesses' statements, taken over all possible conditions (i.e., either the attacker is 185 cm or taller \( H \), or shorter \( S \)):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W1, W2 \mid S) \times P(S) \]
Substitute the values:
\[
P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

3. Finally, compute \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \):

\[
P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.232.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.232}
