To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to estimate \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Let's use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, let's calculate each component:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
    - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods**:
    - Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
        - \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
        - \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time, so the error rate is 30%)
    
    - Given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
        - \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \) (first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time, so the error rate is 20%)
        - \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

3. **Joint likelihood**:
    - \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
    - \( P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Total probability of \(W_1\) and \(W_2\)**:
    
    \[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
    \[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
    \[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

5. **Posterior Probability**:
    
    \[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
    \[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
    \[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
    \[ P(T | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
