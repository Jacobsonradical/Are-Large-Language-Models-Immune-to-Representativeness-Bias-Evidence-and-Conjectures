To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown using the provided information:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\text{height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods based on witnesses:**
   - First witness:
     - \( P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.20 \)
   - Second witness:
     - \( P(\text{witness 2 says height} < 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} < 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.70 \)
     - \( P(\text{witness 2 says height} < 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.30 \)

Given that the first witness claimed that the attacker had been 185 cm or taller, we want to find \( P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness says the height is 185 cm or taller.

Hence:
\[ P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = \frac{P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) * P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm})}{P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm})} \]

Calculate \( P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) * P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) + P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{height} < 185 \text{ cm}) * P(\text{height} < 185 \text{ cm}) \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = 0.29 \]

Now substitute into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{height} \geq 185 \text{ cm} | \text{witness 1 says height} \geq 185 \text{ cm}) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
