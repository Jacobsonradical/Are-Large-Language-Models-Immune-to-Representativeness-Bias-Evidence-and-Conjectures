To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to compute \( P(A | B_1 \text{ and } B_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

First, write out Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2)} \]

Where \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) \) is the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2) \) is the total probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies.

From the provided information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (\( \neg A \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

To find \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) \) and \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | \neg A) \), we use the witnesses' accuracy:
- First witness: For \( A \): \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \), \( P(\neg B_1 | A) = 0.2 \)
                 For \( \neg A \): \( P(B_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \), \( P(\neg B_1 | \neg A) = 0.8 \)
- Second witness: For \( A \): \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \), \( P(\neg B_2 | A) = 0.7 \)
                   For \( \neg A \) : \( P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \), \( P(\neg B_2 | \neg A) = 0.3 \)

Thus:
- \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \cdot P(B_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(B_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now calculate \( P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(A | B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \text{ and } B_2)} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A | B_1 \text{ and } B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \(0.232\).

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
