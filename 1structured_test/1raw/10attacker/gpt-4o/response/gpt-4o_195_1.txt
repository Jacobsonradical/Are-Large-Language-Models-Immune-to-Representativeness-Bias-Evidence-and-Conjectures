To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population distribution, we can apply Bayesian inference.

Let's define the following events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- Prior probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

Witness reliability:
- \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \).

First, let's calculate the total probability of the witnesses' statements \( P(E_1, E_2) \):

\[
P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H)P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(E_1, E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(E_2 | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(E_1, E_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now we calculate the posterior probability \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \):

\[
P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H)P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
{probability: 0.232}
\]
