To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1+ \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2- \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T | W1+) \).

The given probabilities are:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1+ | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W1+ | S) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W2- | T) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W2- | S) = 0.7 \)

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1+) = \frac{P(W1+ | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1+)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W1+) \):

\[ P(W1+) = P(W1+ | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1+ | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W1+) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1+) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1+) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute \( P(W1+) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1+) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1+) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1+) = \frac{12}{29} \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \( 0.414 \).
