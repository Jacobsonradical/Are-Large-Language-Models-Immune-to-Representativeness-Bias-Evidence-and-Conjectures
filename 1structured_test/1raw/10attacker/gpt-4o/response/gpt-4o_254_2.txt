To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (let's denote this event as \( H \)), given the information from the witnesses and the city's population, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- \( W1 \): The first witness claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- Accuracy of \( W1 \): 80% for identifying height as 185 cm or taller, 20% error.
- Accuracy of \( W2 \): 70% for identifying height as shorter than 185 cm, 30% error.
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): Probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \): Probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the city.

First, let's define:
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(H | W1 \cap W2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(W1 \cap W2 | H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) \]

Thus,
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then,
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(H) \cdot P(W1 \cap W2 | H) + P(\neg H) \cdot P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.15 \times 0.24 + 0.85 \times 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.155 \]

Therefore,
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(H) \cdot P(W1 \cap W2 | H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.15 \times 0.24}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
