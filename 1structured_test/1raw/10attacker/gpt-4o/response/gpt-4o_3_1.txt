To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayesian inference. Here's how we can do that step-by-step.

1. Define the events:
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(W1 | S) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(W2 | S) = 0.7 \)
   - \( P(W2 | T) = 0.3 \)

3. Calculate the joint probability of the witnesses' claims aligned with the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \times P(W2 | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
   \]

4. Calculate the joint probability of the witnesses' claims aligned with the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \times P(W2 | S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
   \]

5. Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) \):
   \[
   P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)}
   \]

6. The total probability of the witnesses' combined claims:
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) \times P(S)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

7. Finally, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims:
   \[
   P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
