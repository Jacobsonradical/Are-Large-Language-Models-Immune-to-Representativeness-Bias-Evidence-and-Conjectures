To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A|W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

From the information given:
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|A^c) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be found using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
