To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

We need to estimate \( P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
