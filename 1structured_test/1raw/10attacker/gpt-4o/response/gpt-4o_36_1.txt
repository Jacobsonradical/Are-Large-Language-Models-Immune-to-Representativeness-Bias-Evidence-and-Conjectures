To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information provided by both witnesses.

### Step-by-step solution using Bayes' theorem:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \):**
   \[
   P(H) = 0.15
   \]
   \[
   P(\neg H) = 0.85
   \]

2. **Likelihoods:**
   For the first witness (W1):
   \[
   P(W1 | H) = 0.80
   \]
   \[
   P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20
   \]

   For the second witness (W2):
   \[
   P(W2 | H) = 0.30
   \]
   \[
   P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70
   \]

3. **Joint likelihoods:**
   We need to determine \( P(W1, W2 | H) \) and \( P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \):

   \[
   P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1, W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
   \]

   \[
   P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
   \]

4. **Total Probability \( P(W1, W2) \):**
   \[
   P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85
   \]
   \[
   P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H | W1, W2) \):**
   \[
   P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)}
   \]
   \[
   P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155}
   \]
   \[
   P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
