To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the step-by-step process to calculate it:

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
  
From the given information, we have:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

We also have the accuracy of the witnesses:
- The first witness's accuracy given the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( W_1 | H_1 \)) is 80%, so \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.8 \)
- The first witness's accuracy given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( W_1 | H_2 \)) is 20%, so \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.2 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the formula to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness’s statement is:

\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W_1) \) which is the total probability that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller. It can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) P(H_2) \]

Plug in the values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_1 | W_1) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement is approximately \( 0.414 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
