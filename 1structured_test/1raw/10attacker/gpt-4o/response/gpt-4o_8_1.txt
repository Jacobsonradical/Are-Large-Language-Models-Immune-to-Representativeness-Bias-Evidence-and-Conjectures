To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that someone in the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that someone in the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm if the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, \( P(T | W_1) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W_1) \):
\[
P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
