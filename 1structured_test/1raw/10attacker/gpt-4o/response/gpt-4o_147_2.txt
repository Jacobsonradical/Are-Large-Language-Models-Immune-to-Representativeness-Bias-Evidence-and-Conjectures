To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)  (prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)  (prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm)

Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the witness accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)  (probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \)  (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.
