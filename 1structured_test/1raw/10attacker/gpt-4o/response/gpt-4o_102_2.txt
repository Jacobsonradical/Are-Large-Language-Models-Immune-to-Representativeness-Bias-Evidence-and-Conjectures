Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_S \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_T \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given that:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- For the first witness, \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W1_S | T) = 0.20 \)
                     \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \) and \( P(W1_S | S) = 0.80 \)
- For the second witness, \( P(W2_T | T) = 0.70 \) and \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \)
                       \( P(W2_T | S) = 0.30 \) and \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \).

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

Since \( P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) \):

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 \]

Similarly:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 \]

Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \cdot P(S) \]

So:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now substituting these into the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_S) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the above witness claims, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
