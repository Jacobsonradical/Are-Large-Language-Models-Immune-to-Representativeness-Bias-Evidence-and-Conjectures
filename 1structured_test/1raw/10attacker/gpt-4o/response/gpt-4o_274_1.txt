To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context can be mathematically represented as follows:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_1 | E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (hypothesis \( H_1 \)) given the evidence provided by the first witness (\( E \)).
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the probability that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence provided by the first witness.

1. **Calculate \( P(H_1) \)**: 
   The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller is given as 15%, or:
   \[ P(H_1) = 0.15 \]

2. **Calculate \( P(E | H_1) \)**: 
   The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is indeed that height is given as 80%, or:
   \[ P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \]

3. **Calculate \( P(\neg H_1) \)**: 
   The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm is:
   \[ P(\neg H_1) = 1 - P(H_1) = 0.85 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(E | \neg H_1) \)**: 
   The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 20%, or:
   \[ P(E | \neg H_1) = 0.20 \]

5. **Calculate \( P(E) \)**: 
   The total probability of the evidence provided by the first witness:
   \[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | \neg H_1) \cdot P(\neg H_1) \]
   \[ P(E) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
   \[ P(E) = 0.29 \]

6. **Calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \)**:
   \[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
   \[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
   \[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]

Rounding to two decimal points, the result can be presented as:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
