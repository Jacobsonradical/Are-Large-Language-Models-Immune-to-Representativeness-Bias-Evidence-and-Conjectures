To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   
2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \)
   
We want to find \( P(A | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:
\[ Numerator = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 = 0.12 \]
\[ Denominator = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
