To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T = \text{The attacker is 185 cm or taller} \)
- \( S = \text{The attacker is shorter than 185 cm} \)
- \( W_1 = \text{The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller} \)
- \( W_2 = \text{The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm} \)

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.8 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.2 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.3 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.7 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate the posterior probability \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the claims of both witnesses.

First, we calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) \) (probability of both witnesses' claims given the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) \) (probability of both witnesses' claims given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Using the law of total probability, we calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to calculate \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.2323 \).
