To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to calculating it, incorporating both the witness testimonies and the prior probability of people's heights in the population.

Let's define the following probabilities:

- \( H_{\geq 185} \): Probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_{< 185} \): Probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We seek to find \( P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies.

Given data:
- Prior probabilities from the population:
  - \( P(H_{\geq 185}) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(H_{< 185}) = 0.85 \)

- Witness accuracy:
  - First witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
    - \( P(\text{first says} \geq 185 | H_{\geq 185}) = 0.8 \)
    - \( P(\text{first says} \geq 185 | H_{< 185}) = 0.2 \)
  - Second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time:
    - \( P(\text{second says} < 185 | H_{< 185}) = 0.7 \)
    - \( P(\text{second says} < 185 | H_{\geq 185}) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can express the posterior probability using the formula:

\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) = \frac{P(\text{witnesses} | H_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(H_{\geq 185})}{P(\text{witnesses})} \]

Where:

\[ P(\text{witnesses}) = P(\text{witnesses} | H_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(H_{\geq 185}) + P(\text{witnesses} | H_{< 185}) \cdot P(H_{< 185}) \]

First, calculate \( P(\text{witnesses} | H_{\geq 185}) \):

\[ P(\text{witnesses} | H_{\geq 185}) = P(\text{first says} \geq 185 | H_{\geq 185}) \cdot P(\text{second says} < 185 | H_{\geq 185}) \]
\[ P(\text{witnesses} | H_{\geq 185}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(\text{witnesses} | H_{< 185}) \):

\[ P(\text{witnesses} | H_{< 185}) = P(\text{first says} \geq 185 | H_{< 185}) \cdot P(\text{second says} < 185 | H_{< 185}) \]
\[ P(\text{witnesses} | H_{< 185}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the denominator \( P(\text{witnesses}) \):

\[ P(\text{witnesses}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{witnesses}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) \):

\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_{\geq 185} | \text{witnesses}) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
