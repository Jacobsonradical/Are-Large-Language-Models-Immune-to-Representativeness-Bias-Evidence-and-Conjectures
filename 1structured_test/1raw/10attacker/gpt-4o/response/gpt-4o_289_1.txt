To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here’s the step-by-step calculation:

1. Let’s define the events:
   - \( T \): The attacker is taller than or equal to 185 cm.
   - \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1 \): The first witness claimed that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2 \): The second witness claimed that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - The first witness's accuracy:
     - \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \)
     - \( P(W1 | S) = 0.2 \)
   - The second witness's accuracy:
     - \( P(W2 | T) = 0.3 \)
     - \( P(W2 | S) = 0.7 \)

3. We want to find \( P(T | W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. Using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)}
   \]
   Where \( P(W1) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S)
   \]

4. Substitute the known values:
   \[
   P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. Now use Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(T | W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

So, our estimate of the probability based on the first witness's claim is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
