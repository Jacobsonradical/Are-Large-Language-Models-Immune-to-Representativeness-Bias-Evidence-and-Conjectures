To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs with new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the available information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1|A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1|B) = 0.20 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W2|A) = 0.30 \) (the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2|B) = 0.70 \) (the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A|W1) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W1) = \frac{P(W1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W1) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.
