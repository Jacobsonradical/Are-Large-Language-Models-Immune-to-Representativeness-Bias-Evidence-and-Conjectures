To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( H_t \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the first witness's claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the second witness's claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:

- Probability of \( H_t \) (Prior Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- Probability of \( H_s \) (Prior Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85
- Probability of the first witness identifying an attacker who is 185 cm or taller as tall (\( P(W_1 | H_t) \)) = 0.8
- Probability of the first witness erring (\( P(W_1 | H_s) \)) = 0.2
- Probability of the second witness identifying an attacker who is shorter than 185 cm correctly as short (\( P(W_2 | H_s) \)) = 0.7
- Probability of the second witness erring (\( P(W_2 | H_t) \)) = 0.3

We need to find:

\[ P(H_t | W_1) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_t | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we'll calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W_1 | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_t | W_1) \):

\[ P(H_t | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | W_1) = 0.4138 \]

So,

\[ \{probability: 0.4138\} \]
