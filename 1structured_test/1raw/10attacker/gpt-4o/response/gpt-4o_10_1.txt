To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

First, we need to define the events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.8 \) (The probability that the first witness is correct if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.2 \) (The probability that the first witness is wrong if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.7 \) (The probability that the second witness is correct if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.3 \) (The probability that the second witness is wrong if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We need to find:
- \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now we need to calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \) using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = 0.232 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
