To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we will use Bayes' theorem.

Let \(H\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \(S\) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
Let \(W_1\) be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \(W_2\) be the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \).

First, we calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Next, let's use the given accuracy rates for the witnesses:

For witness 1:
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (witness 1 accurately identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 \mid S) = 0.20 \) (witness 1 erroneously identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time)

For witness 2:
- \( P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.70 \) (witness 2 accurately identifies shorter height 70% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (witness 2 erroneously identifies taller people as shorter 30% of the time)

Now we can use Bayes' theorem. First, we find the joint probability \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) = P(W_1 \mid S) \cdot P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate the marginal probability of \(P(W_1 \cap W_2)\):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.232\}
