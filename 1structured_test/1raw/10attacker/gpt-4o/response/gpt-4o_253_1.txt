To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We seek \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

Where \( P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) \) is the joint probability of both witnesses' claims given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( P(E_1, E_2) \) is the total probability of both witnesses' claims.

Since the witnesses' testimonies can be considered independent:

\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Similarly:

\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then:

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
