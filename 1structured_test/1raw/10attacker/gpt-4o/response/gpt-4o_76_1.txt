To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s how we can structure the problem and compute the needed probabilities:

1. Denote the following events:
   - \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

3. We need \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims this.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
