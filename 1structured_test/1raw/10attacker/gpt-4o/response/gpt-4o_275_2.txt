To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of both witnesses.

First, we need the prior probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Next, we evaluate the likelihoods based on the witness accuracies:
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, the joint probabilities with the witnesses are:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) * P(W_2 | T) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) * P(W_2 | S) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The total probability for observing the witnesses' statements is:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) * P(T) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) * P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability:
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) * P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 * 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.23226 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{probability: 0.23226 \} \]
