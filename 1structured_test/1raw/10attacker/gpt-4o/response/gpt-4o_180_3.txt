To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- The first witness's probabilities:
  - \( P(W1|A) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
  - \( P(W1|B) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)
- The second witness's probabilities:
  - \( P(W2|A) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)
  - \( P(W2|B) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(A|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

First, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|W1) \):

\[
P(A|W1) = \frac{P(W1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)}
\]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness's statement:

\[
P(W1) = P(W1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

\[
P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(A|W1) \):

\[
P(A|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Now, let's incorporate the second witness's statement. We use \( P(A|W1) \) as our updated prior. Using Bayes' theorem again, we update it with the second witness:

\[
P(A|W1,W2) = \frac{P(W2|A) \cdot P(A|W1)}{P(W2|W1)}
\]

Where \( P(W2|W1) \) is the total probability of the second witness's statement given the first witness's statement:

\[
P(W2|W1) = P(W2|A) \cdot P(A|W1) + P(W2|B) \cdot P(B|W1)
\]

We need \( P(B|W1) \):

\[
P(B|W1) = 1 - P(A|W1) = 1 - 0.414 = 0.586
\]

Now, calculate \( P(W2|W1) \):

\[
P(W2|W1) = (0.30 \cdot 0.414) + (0.70 \cdot 0.586) \approx 0.1242 + 0.4102 = 0.5344
\]

Finally, we calculate \( P(A|W1,W2) \):

\[
P(A|W1,W2) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.414}{0.5344} \approx \frac{0.1242}{0.5344} \approx 0.23243
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately:

\[
\mathbf{Probability: 0.232}
\]
