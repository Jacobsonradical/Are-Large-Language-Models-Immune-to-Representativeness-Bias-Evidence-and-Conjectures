To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies and the known probabilities, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(T'\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W1_T\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W2_T'\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \(P(T | W1_T, W2_T')\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

From the given information, we have:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(T') = 0.85\)
- \(P(W1_T | T) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W1_T | T') = 0.20\)
- \(P(W2_T' | T) = 0.30\)
- \(P(W2_T' | T') = 0.70\)

We will use Bayes' theorem combined with the law of total probability:

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_T') = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_T' | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_T')} \]

First, let's find \(P(W1_T, W2_T')\) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_T') = P(W1_T, W2_T' | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_T' | T') \cdot P(T') \]

\[ P(W1_T, W2_T' | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_T' | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1_T, W2_T' | T') = P(W1_T | T') \cdot P(W2_T' | T') = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we can calculate \(P(W1_T, W2_T')\):

\[ P(W1_T, W2_T') = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Next, apply Bayes' theorem to find \(P(T | W1_T, W2_T')\):

\[ P(T | W1_T, W2_T') = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_T' | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_T')} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
