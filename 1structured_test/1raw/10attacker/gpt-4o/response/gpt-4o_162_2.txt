To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_T \): The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_T|T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W1_T|S) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W2_T|T) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W2_T|S) = 0.7 \)

We need to find \( P(T|W1_T, W2_T) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

First, we need to find the combined probability of both witness statements if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

1. Probability of both witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_T|T) = P(W1_T|T) \times P(W2_T|T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

2. Probability of both witnesses' testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_T|S) = P(W1_T|S) \times P(W2_T|S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

3. Total probability of the combined testimonies:
\[ P(W1_T, W2_T) = P(W1_T, W2_T|T) \times P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_T|S) \times P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_T) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_T) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1_T, W2_T) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_T|T) \times P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_T)} \]
\[ P(T|W1_T, W2_T) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1_T, W2_T) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
