To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem. The information provided gives us the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.

### Given Information:

- Prior probabilities:
  - \( P(\text{H}_1) = P(\text{taller than 185 cm}) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(\text{H}_2) = P(\text{shorter than 185 cm}) = 0.85 \)
  
- Likelihoods (based on the witness accuracy):
  - First witness:
    - \( P(\text{First witness says tall}|\text{H}_1) = 0.80 \)
    - \( P(\text{First witness says tall}|\text{H}_2) = 0.20 \)
  - Second witness:
    - \( P(\text{Second witness says short}|\text{H}_1) = 0.30 \)
    - \( P(\text{Second witness says short}|\text{H}_2) = 0.70 \)

### Calculation using Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem for the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(\text{H}_1|\text{First witness says tall}) = \frac{P(\text{First witness says tall}|\text{H}_1) \times P(\text{H}_1)}{P(\text{First witness says tall})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{First witness says tall}) \):
\[ P(\text{First witness says tall}) = P(\text{First witness says tall}|\text{H}_1) \times P(\text{H}_1) + P(\text{First witness says tall}|\text{H}_2) \times P(\text{H}_2) \]
\[ P(\text{First witness says tall}) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{First witness says tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{First witness says tall}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use this to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{H}_1|\text{First witness says tall}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_1|\text{First witness says tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{H}_1|\text{First witness says tall}) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness claimed so, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
