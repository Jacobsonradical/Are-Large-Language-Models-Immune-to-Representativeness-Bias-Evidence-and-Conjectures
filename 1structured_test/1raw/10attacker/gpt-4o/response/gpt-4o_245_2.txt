To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that any person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability that any person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the 1st witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the 1st witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2|T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the 2nd witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter)
- \( P(W_2|S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the 2nd witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in finding \( P(T|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(T|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|T) \):
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|T) = P(W_1|T) \cdot P(W_2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|S) \):
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|S) = P(W_1|S) \cdot P(W_2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then, we calculate \( P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we find \( P(T|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \):
\[ P(T|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = \frac{36}{155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{probability: 0.2323\}
\]
