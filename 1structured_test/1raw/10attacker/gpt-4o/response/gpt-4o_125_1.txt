To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given probabilities:
- Prior probabilities:
  - \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
  - \(P(H_2) = 0.85\)

- Likelihoods (based on the witnesses' accuracy):
  - \(P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80\)
  - \(P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20\)
  - \(P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30\)
  - \(P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70\)

We need to calculate \(P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) \]

And:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

First, let's calculate the joint probabilities:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \(P(E_1 \cap E_2)\):
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \(0.2323\).
