To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We have:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller),
2. \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that someone in the city is shorter than 185 cm),
3. \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall attacker),
4. \( P(W1 | S) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall),
5. \( P(W2 | T) = 0.3 \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall attacker as short),
6. \( P(W2 | S) = 0.7 \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short attacker).

We want to find \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness accounts.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \times P(W2 | T) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \times P(W2 | S) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | S) P(S) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

So, we have:

\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can compute \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
