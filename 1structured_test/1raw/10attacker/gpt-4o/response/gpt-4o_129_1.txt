To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence provided by the witnesses. 

From the information provided:

- The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller (\( P(H_1) \)): 15% = 0.15
- The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(H_2) \)): 85% = 0.85

Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time when that is indeed the case and 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter.

- \( P(E_1 | H_1) \) = 0.80
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) \) = 0.20

Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time when that is indeed the case and 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

- \( P(E_2 | H_2) \) = 0.70
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) \) = 0.30

The evidence used by the witnesses is:

- \( E_1 \): The claim from witness 1 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( E_2 \): The claim from witness 2 that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Under the assumption that these witnesses are independent, we can calculate the joint likelihoods:

\[ P(E | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(E | H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \times P(H_2)} \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{(0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{36}{155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
