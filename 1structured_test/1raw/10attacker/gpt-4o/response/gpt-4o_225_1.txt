To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayesian inference. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \).

First, we'll define:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Given the accuracy of the witnesses:
- For the first witness: \( P(W_1 \mid H_1) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 \mid H_2) = 0.2 \)
- For the second witness: \( P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.7 \)

We can use Bayes' theorem to combine these pieces of evidence.

First, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) = P(W_1 \mid H_1) \times P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) = P(W_1 \mid H_2) \times P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, using the law of total probability, we find \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) \times P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

The posterior probability \( P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \) is then:
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.232.
