To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- The prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) \), is 0.15.
- The prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(S) \), is 0.85.
  
The reliability of the witnesses is given by:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \): The first witness correctly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time.
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.2 \): The first witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time.
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.7 \): The second witness correctly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time.
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.3 \): The second witness incorrectly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

We need to find \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, we compute \( P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | S) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \times P(W2 | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \times P(W2 | S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, we compute the total probability \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we find \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \( 0.232 \).
