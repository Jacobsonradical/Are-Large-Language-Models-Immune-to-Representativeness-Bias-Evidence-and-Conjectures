To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( T \) = The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) = The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{T} \) = The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{N} \) = The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(N) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_{T} | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness is correct when attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1_{T} | N) = 0.20 \) (first witness is incorrect when attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2_{N} | N) = 0.70 \) (second witness is correct when attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2_{N} | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness is incorrect when attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We want to find \( P(T | W1_{T}, W2_{N}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

First, use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ 
P(T | W1_{T}, W2_{N}) = \frac{P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_{T}, W2_{N})} 
\]

Next, we need to find the joint probabilities \( P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | T) \) and \( P(W1_{T}, W2_{N}) \):

\[ 
P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | T) = P(W1_{T} | T) \cdot P(W2_{N} | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 
\]

\[ 
P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | N) = P(W1_{T} | N) \cdot P(W2_{N} | N) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 
\]

Using the law of total probability:

\[ 
P(W1_{T}, W2_{N}) = P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | N) \cdot P(N) 
\]

\[ 
P(W1_{T}, W2_{N}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 
\]

Now, we can find \( P(T | W1_{T}, W2_{N}) \):

\[ 
P(T | W1_{T}, W2_{N}) = \frac{P(W1_{T}, W2_{N} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_{T}, W2_{N})} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
