To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): The second witness says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

1. The prior probabilities:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

2. The witness reliability:
   - \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(T | W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) \). By Bayes' theorem, we need to find:

\[ P(T | W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | T) P(T)}{P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S)} \]

Let's break this down:

1. Calculate \( P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | T) \):
   \[ P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. Calculate \( P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | S) \):
   \[ P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

3. Calculate \( P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) = P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | T) P(T) + P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) \):

\[ P(T | W1_T \text{ and } W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S | T) P(T)}{P(W1_T \text{ and } W2_S)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
