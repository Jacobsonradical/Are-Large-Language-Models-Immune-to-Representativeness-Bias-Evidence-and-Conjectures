To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
    - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
    - Let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
    - Let \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

    Given:
    - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
    - \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller)
    - \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifies attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
    - \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Calculate the joint probabilities:**
    - \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \times P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
    - \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \times P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

3. **Calculate the marginal probabilities:**
    - \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \):
        \[
        P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) \times P(S) 
        \]
        \[
        P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) 
        \]
        \[
        P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 
        \]

4. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**
    \[
    P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)}
    \]

    Plug in the values:
    \[
    P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
    \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
