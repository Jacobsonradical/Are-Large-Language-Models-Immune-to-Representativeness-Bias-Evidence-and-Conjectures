To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( T \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{T} \): the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{S} \): the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

The witness accuracy rates:
- First witness:
  - \( P(W1_{T} \mid T) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W1_{T} \mid S) = 0.20 \)
- Second witness:
  - \( P(W2_{S} \mid T) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(W2_{S} \mid S) = 0.70 \)

We are interested in finding \( P(T \mid W1_{T}) \).

1. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}) = \frac{P(W1_{T} \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_{T})} \]

To find \( P(W1_{T}) \):
\[ P(W1_{T}) = P(W1_{T} \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_{T} \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1_{T}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.29 \]

Now calculate \( P(T \mid W1_{T}) \):
\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims this height, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, to answer in the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
