To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to determine \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements.

Given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (since the second witness errs 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we will find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

First, we need to calculate the joint probabilities:

- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Next, we calculate the total probability \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability:} \ 0.232 \} \]
