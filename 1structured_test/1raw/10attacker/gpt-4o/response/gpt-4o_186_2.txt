To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the probabilities given:
- \( P(A) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|W1) \): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg E|W1) \): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E|W2) \): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg E|W2) \): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information given:

*P(\text{attacker 185 cm or taller})*:
\[ P(\text{taller}) = 0.15 \]

*P(\text{attacker shorter than 185 cm})*:
\[ P(\text{shorter}) = 0.85 \]

*First witness*:
\[ P(\text{W1 says taller | attacker taller}) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(\text{W1 says taller | attacker shorter}) = 0.2 \]

*Second witness*:
\[ P(\text{W2 says shorter | attacker shorter}) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(\text{W2 says shorter | attacker taller}) = 0.3 \]

We are trying to estimate \( P(\text{taller}|\text{W1 says taller}) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{taller}|\text{W1 says taller}) = \frac{P(\text{W1 says taller}|\text{taller}) \cdot P(\text{taller})}{P(\text{W1 says taller})} \]

First, find \( P(\text{W1 says taller}) \):
\[ P(\text{W1 says taller}) = P(\text{W1 says taller}|\text{taller}) \cdot P(\text{taller}) + P(\text{W1 says taller}|\text{shorter}) \cdot P(\text{shorter}) \]
\[ = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{taller}|\text{W1 says taller}) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
