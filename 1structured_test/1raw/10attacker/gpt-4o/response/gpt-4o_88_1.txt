To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here, we want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witnesses. 

The relevant information is:
- \( P(A) \): Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(B) \): Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- \( P(E1|A) \): Probability the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8
- \( P(E1|B) \): Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.2
- \( P(E2|A) \): Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm = 0.3
- \( P(E2|B) \): Probability the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm = 0.7

First, we calculate the probability of each piece of evidence occurring overall (marginal likelihoods):
\[ P(E1) = P(E1|A)P(A) + P(E1|B)P(B) \]
\[ P(E1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Next, for simplicity, we assume independence between the witnesses (which may not be strictly valid but will be assumed here for this calculation):
\[ P(E2) = P(E2|A)P(A) + P(E2|B)P(B) \]
\[ P(E2) = (0.3)(0.15) + (0.7)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E2) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

To use Bayes' Theorem, the combined evidence (both witnesses' claims) should be considered:
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2|A) = P(E1|A)P(E2|A) \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2|A) = (0.8)(0.3) = 0.24 \]

\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2|B) = P(E1|B)P(E2|B) \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2|B) = (0.2)(0.7) = 0.14 \]

\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2) = P(E1 \text{ and } E2|A)P(A) + P(E1 \text{ and } E2|B)P(B) \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2) = (0.24)(0.15) + (0.14)(0.85) \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A|E1 \text{ and } E2) \):
\[ P(A|E1 \text{ and } E2) = \frac{P(E1 \text{ and } E2|A)P(A)}{P(E1 \text{ and } E2)} \]
\[ P(A|E1 \text{ and } E2) = \frac{(0.24)(0.15)}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|E1 \text{ and } E2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
