To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting witness statements and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- Probability that someone is 185 cm or taller in the population, \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \).
- Probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm in the population, \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \).

Witness testimonies and accuracy:
- First witness claims 185 cm or taller, with 80% accuracy:
  - \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- Second witness claims shorter than 185 cm, with 70% accuracy:
  - \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

First, we calculate the joint probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate the total probability \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply these to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( \boxed{0.232} \).
