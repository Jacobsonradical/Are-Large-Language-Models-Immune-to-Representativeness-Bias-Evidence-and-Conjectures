To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. 

Let's denote:
- \( T \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): Event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are asked to find \( P(T | W1, \text{ W2 says attacker is shorter than 185 cm}) \).

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (first witness accurately identifies 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies shorter person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller person as shorter)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (second witness accurately identifies shorter person)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, let's calculate the joint probabilities:
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we find \( P(W1, W2) \) which includes both scenarios where the attacker could be tall or short:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So our estimate is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.2323 \} \]
