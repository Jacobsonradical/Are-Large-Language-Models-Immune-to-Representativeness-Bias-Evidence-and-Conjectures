To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{T} \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The probabilities given in the problem are:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\overline{T}) = 0.85 \)

The reliability of the witnesses:
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \overline{T}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | \overline{T}) = 0.70 \)

We are interested in \( P(T | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

To find \( P(W_1) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | \overline{T}) \cdot P(\overline{T}) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T | W_1) \):
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.41 \]

So, the estimate is:
\[ \{ probability: 0.41 \} \]
