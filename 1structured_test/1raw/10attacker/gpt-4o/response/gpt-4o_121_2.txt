To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) be the events that the first and second witnesses claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) where \(\neg A\) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First witness:
- \( P(B_1|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(B_1|\neg A) = 0.20 \)

Second witness: 
- \( P(B_2|A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(B_2|\neg A) = 0.70 \)

We are looking for \( P(A|B_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B_1) = \frac{P(B_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1)}
\]

To find \( P(B_1) \), the total probability of the first witness's claim:
\[
P(B_1) = P(B_1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
P(B_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(B_1) = (0.12) + (0.17) = 0.29
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A|B_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(A|B_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.414} \}
\]
