To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information and the witnesses' reliability, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witnesses.

First, let's define the terms:
- \( P(H_1) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E | H_1) \): The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H_2) \): The probability of the evidence given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E) \): The overall probability of the evidence.

Given data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

Witness reliabilities:
- The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller: 80% accurate, 20% error.
- The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm: 70% accurate, 30% error.

The evidence \( E \) is a combination of witness testimonies:
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)}
\]

Now, we find \( P(E | H_1) \) and \( P(E | H_2) \):
- \( P(E | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Next, we calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \):
\[
P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.232}
\]
