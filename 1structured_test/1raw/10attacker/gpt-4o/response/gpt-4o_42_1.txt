To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements and their accuracy, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | \text{witnesses' statements}) \).

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(\text{statement 1} | H_1) = 0.8 \) (first witness's accuracy for 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{statement 1} | H_2) = 0.2 \) (first witness's error for shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(\text{statement 2} | H_1) = 0.3 \) (second witness's error for 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{statement 2} | H_2) = 0.7 \) (second witness's accuracy for shorter than 185 cm)

We also need the joint probability of both witnesses' statements. Since these probabilities are conditionally independent given the height assumption, we calculate as follows:

1. Calculate \( P(\text{statements} | H_1) \):
\[ P(\text{statements} | H_1) = P(\text{statement 1} | H_1) \times P(\text{statement 2} | H_1) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

2. Calculate \( P(\text{statements} | H_2) \):
\[ P(\text{statements} | H_2) = P(\text{statement 1} | H_2) \times P(\text{statement 2} | H_2) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

3. Compute the total probability of the statements:
\[ P(\text{statements}) = P(\text{statements} | H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(\text{statements} | H_2) \times P(H_2) \]
\[ P(\text{statements}) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{statements}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. Calculate the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | \text{statements}) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | \text{statements}) = \frac{P(\text{statements} | H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(\text{statements})} \]
\[ P(H_1 | \text{statements}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | \text{statements}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
