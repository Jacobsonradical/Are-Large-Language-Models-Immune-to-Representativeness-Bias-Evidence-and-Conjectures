To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, we can use Bayes' theorem. Given the information, we have:

### Notations
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness's claim (attacker is \(\geq 185\) cm).
- \( W_2 \): Second witness's claim (attacker is \(< 185\) cm).

### Given Probabilities
1. **Prior probabilities (from population data)**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

2. **Witness accuracy**
   - First witness accuracy \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
   - First witness inaccuracy \( P(W_1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
   
   - Second witness accuracy \( P(W_2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \)
   - Second witness inaccuracy \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)

### Using Bayes' Theorem
We need to find:
\[ P(T | W_1) \]
This can be calculated as:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

### Calculating \( P(W_1) \)
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

### Calculating \( P(T | W_1) \)
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

### Result
So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
