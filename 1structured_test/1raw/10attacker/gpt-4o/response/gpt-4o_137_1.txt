This is a classic problem of applying Bayes' theorem to update the probability based on new evidence. To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we need to consider both the probability provided by the witnesses and the base rate of the population's height distribution.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller in the population)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm in the population)

Given the first witness's testimony (\( T_1 \)):
- \( P(T_1|H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T_1|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|T_1) = \frac{P(T_1|H)P(H)}{P(T_1)} \]

Where \( P(T_1) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(T_1) = P(T_1|H)P(H) + P(T_1|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(T_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(T_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(T_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(H|T_1) \):

\[ P(H|T_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|T_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|T_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
