To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

First, define the provided probabilities:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
5. \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
6. \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)

Next, we find the joint probabilities using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) P(S) \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) P(W_2 | T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) P(W_2 | S) \]

Now, calculate:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

So:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to determine \( P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim and the second witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
