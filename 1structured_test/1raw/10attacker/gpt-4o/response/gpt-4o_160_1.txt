Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness claims.

We'll use Bayes' Theorem for this purpose. First, we need to calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)

Next, we'll use the provided witness accuracy information:
- \( P(W1 \mid H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 \mid L) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 \mid H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 \mid L) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Since \( P(W1, W2 \mid H) \) assumes independence between the witnesses:

\[ P(W1, W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \cdot P(W2 \mid H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Similarly:
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid L) = P(W1 \mid L) \cdot P(W2 \mid L) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 \mid L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, plug these values into Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus,
