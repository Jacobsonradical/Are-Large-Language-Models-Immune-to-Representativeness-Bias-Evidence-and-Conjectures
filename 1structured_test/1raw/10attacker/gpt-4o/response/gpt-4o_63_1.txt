To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and the demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Define the probabilities:**

   - \( P(\text{H}) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\neg \text{H}) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(\text{W1}|\text{H}) \): Probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(\text{W1}|\neg \text{H}) \): Probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(\text{W2}|\text{H}) \): Probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(\text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) \): Probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

2. **Assign the given probabilities:**

   - \( P(\text{H}) = 0.15 \) 
   - \( P(\neg \text{H}) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(\text{W1}|\text{H}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{W1}|\neg \text{H}) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(\text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{W2}|\text{H}) = 0.30 \)

3. **Calculate the combined likelihood of both witnesses' testimonies:**

   We want \( P(\text{H}|\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) \), which is the posterior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

   Using Bayes' theorem:

   \[
   P(\text{H}|\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) = \frac{P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2})}
   \]

   where \( P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\text{H}) = P(\text{W1}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{W2}|\text{H}) \) assuming independence, and similarly for \( P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) \).

4. **Calculate the likelihoods:**

   \[
   P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\text{H}) = P(\text{W1}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{W2}|\text{H}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) = P(\text{W1}|\neg \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
   \]

5. **Calculate the marginal probability \( P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) \):**

   \[
   P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) = P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H}) + P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}|\neg \text{H}) \cdot P(\neg \text{H})
   \]

   \[
   P(\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

6. **Putting it all together:**

   \[
   P(\text{H}|\text{W1} \text{ and } \text{W2}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

So, our estimate for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and city demographics, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
