To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here are the relevant facts and steps needed to calculate this probability:

Given data:
1. \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(\text{Short}) = 0.85 \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.
3. First witness' accuracy:
   - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) = 0.20 \)
4. Second witness' accuracy:
   - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{Second Witness says Short}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Second Witness says Short}) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) \).

First, calculate the probabilities considering the accuracy of the first witness:

- \( P(\text{First Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{First Witness says Tall} | \text{Short}) = 0.20 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) = \frac{P(\text{First Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{First Witness says Tall})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{First Witness says Tall}) = P(\text{First Witness says Tall} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{First Witness says Tall} | \text{Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]

Now plug in the values:
\[ P(\text{First Witness says Tall}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{First Witness says Tall}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{First Witness says Tall}) = 0.29 \]

Finally:
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First Witness says Tall}) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.41} \} \]
