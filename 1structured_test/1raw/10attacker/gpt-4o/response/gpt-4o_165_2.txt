Let's denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( T \), and the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as \( S \).

From the problem:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Let's denote the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( W_1 \), and the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm as \( W_2 \).

Given:
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)

We want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:
\[ P(T | W_1) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can plug this back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
