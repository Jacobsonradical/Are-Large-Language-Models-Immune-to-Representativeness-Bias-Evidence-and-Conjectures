To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:

- \( H \): Height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Height of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness stating the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness stating the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to compute \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2) \), the probability of \( H \) given the testimonies. 

Using Bayes' Theorem,

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we handle individual components starting with prior probabilities:

\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

Next, we incorporate the witness reliability:

For the first witness (\( W_1 \)):
\[ P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \]

For the second witness (\( W_2 \)):
\[ P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \]

To find the joint probability of both witnesses' testimonies, these are calculated as follows:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

The total probability \( P(W_1, W_2) \) is obtained by the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply these values in Bayes' formula:

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.2323 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \( \boxed{0.2323} \).
