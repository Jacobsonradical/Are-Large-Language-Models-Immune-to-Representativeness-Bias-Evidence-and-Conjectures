To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

First, calculate the joint probability \( P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | B) \):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W1 \cap W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \cdot P(W2 | B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Next, calculate the marginal probability \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \cap W2 | B) \cdot P(B)
\]

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W1 \cap W2) \):

\[
P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1 \cap W2)}
\]

\[
P(A | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

{probability: 0.232}
