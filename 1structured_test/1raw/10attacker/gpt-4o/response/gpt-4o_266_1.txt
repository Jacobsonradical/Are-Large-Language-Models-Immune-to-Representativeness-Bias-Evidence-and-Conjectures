To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We can calculate the following probabilities from the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(A | W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(W1) \), which is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W1) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 | B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Substitute the given values:

\[
P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

\[
P(W1) = (0.12) + (0.17)
\]

\[
P(W1) = 0.29
\]

Now, substitute \( P(W1) \) back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A | W1) \approx 0.414
\]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness claimed so, is approximately:

\[
\{probability: 0.414\}
\]
