To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event \( T \)), we can apply Bayes' theorem, considering the witnesses' reliability.

Let's denote:
- \( A = \) attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( B = \) attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 = \) first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W2 = \) second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|B) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(A|W1 \text{ claims 185 cm or taller}) \).

By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W1) = \frac{P(W1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W1) \):

\[
P(W1) = P(W1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(W1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85
\]

\[
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W1) \):

\[
P(A|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]

\[
P(A|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \}
\]
