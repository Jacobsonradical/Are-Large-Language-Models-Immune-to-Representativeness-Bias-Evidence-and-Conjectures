The problem can be approached using Bayes' Theorem. We are given the following information:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H') = 0.85 \): Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Witness 1's reliability: \( P(E1|H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(E1|H') = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2's reliability: \( P(E2|H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E2|H') = 0.7 \).

We want to find \( P(H|E1 \text{ and } E2') \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

First, we calculate \( P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H) \) and \( P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H') \):

- \( P(E1|H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E2'|H) = 1 - P(E2|H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H) = P(E1|H) \times P(E2'|H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \)

- \( P(E1|H') = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E2'|H') = 1 - P(E2|H') = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H') = P(E1|H') \times P(E2'|H') = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)

Next, we calculate the marginal probability \( P(E1 \text{ and } E2') \):

\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2') = P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H) \times P(H) + P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H') \times P(H') \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2') = (0.56 \times 0.15) + (0.06 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E1 \text{ and } E2') = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|E1 \text{ and } E2') = \frac{P(E1 \text{ and } E2'|H) \times P(H)}{P(E1 \text{ and } E2')} \]
\[ P(H|E1 \text{ and } E2') = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H|E1 \text{ and } E2') = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies is approximately 0.622.
