To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the events and their probabilities as follows:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Here's the breakdown of calculations:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness claims 185 cm or taller given the height is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness claims 185 cm or taller given the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2)} \]

Substituting in the known values:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85} \]

Simplify the denominator:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.17} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.414.
