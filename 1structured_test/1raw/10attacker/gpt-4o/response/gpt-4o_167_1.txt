To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define our variables first:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\neg W_1|\neg H) = 0.70 \)

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1|\neg H) \) and \( P(\neg W_1|H) \):
- \( P(W_1|\neg H) = 1 - P(\neg W_1|\neg H) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\neg W_1|H) = 1 - P(W_1|H) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \)

Now, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H|W_1) \):

\[ 
P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

We plug in the values:

\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.255
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.375
\]

Now, we calculate \( P(H|W_1) \):

\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(H|W_1) = 0.32
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{probability: 0.32\}
\]

So, in the format requested:

\{probability: 0.32\}
