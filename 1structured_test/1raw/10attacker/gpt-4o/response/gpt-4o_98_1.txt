To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A \mid W_1) \).

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \mid A) \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(A) \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15.
- \( P(W_1) \): Total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To calculate \( P(W_1) \), we need to consider both possibilities (attacker is 185 cm or taller, and attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]
Where:
- \( P(W_1 \mid B) \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

Now we can calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A \mid W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
