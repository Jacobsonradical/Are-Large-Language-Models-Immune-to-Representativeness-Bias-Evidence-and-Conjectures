To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we break down the problem:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) \).

First, calculate the joint probability \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \times P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \times P(W2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) \times P(B)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[ 
P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85}
= \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119}
= \frac{0.036}{0.155}
\approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
