To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness reports, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( A \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

From the problem, we can extract the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

For the first witness:
- \( P(W_1 \mid A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid B) = 0.20 \)

For the second witness:
- \( P(W_2 \mid A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid B) = 0.70 \)

First, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the intermediate probabilities:
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(B \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid B) \cdot P(B)}{P(W_1)} \]

To calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \mid B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]
\[ P(B \mid W_1) = \frac{0.20 \cdot 0.85}{0.29} = \frac{0.17}{0.29} \approx 0.586 \]

Next, we update given the second witness's information:
\[ P(A \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid W_1)}{P(W_2 \mid W_1)} \]
\[ P(W_2 \mid W_1) = P(W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A \mid W_1) + P(W_2 \mid B) \cdot P(B \mid W_1) \]

\[ P(W_2 \mid W_1) = (0.30 \cdot 0.414) + (0.70 \cdot 0.586) \]
\[ P(W_2 \mid W_1) = 0.124 + 0.410 = 0.534 \]

So,
\[ P(A \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.414}{0.534} = \frac{0.1242}{0.534} \approx 0.233 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability:} \ 0.233 \} \]
