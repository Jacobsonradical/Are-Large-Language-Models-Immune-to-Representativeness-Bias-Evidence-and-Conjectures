To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the detailed breakdown of the steps:

- Let \( T \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( S \) denote the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W1_T \) denote the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W2_T \) denote the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W2_S \) denote the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
3. \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \)
4. \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \)
5. \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \)
6. \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \)

We are required to find \( P(T | W1_T) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{P(T) \cdot P(W1_T | T)}{P(W1_T)} \]

First, we need \( P(W1_T) \):

\[ P(W1_T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Now substituting the values:

\[ P(W1_T) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_T) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{(0.15 \cdot 0.80)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
