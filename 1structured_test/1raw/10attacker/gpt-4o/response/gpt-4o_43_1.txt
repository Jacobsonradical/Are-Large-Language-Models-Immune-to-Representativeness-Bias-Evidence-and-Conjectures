We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem. Here's how we do it:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( S \) be the event that the attacker’s height is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Witnesses' accuracy:**
   - First witness: \( P(\text{identifying | T}) = 0.80 \), \( P(\text{identifying | S}) = 0.20 \)
   - Second witness: \( P(\text{identifying | T}) = 0.30 \), \( P(\text{identifying | S}) = 0.70 \)

3. **Population distribution:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Given the above information, we want to find \( P(T | \text{witness 1 says T and witness 2 says S}) \).

Let's denote:
- \( W1 = \text{Witness 1 says T} \)
- \( W2 = \text{Witness 2 says S} \)

First, we compute the likelihood of this combined testimony for both hypothesis \( T \) (attacker 185 cm or taller) and \( S \) (attacker shorter than 185 cm).

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

Where \( P(W1 \cap W2) \) can be found as:

\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.155 \]

Then,

\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is roughly:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
