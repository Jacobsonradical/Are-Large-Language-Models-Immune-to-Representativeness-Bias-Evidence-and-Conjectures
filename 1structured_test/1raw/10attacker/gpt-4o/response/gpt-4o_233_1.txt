To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We denote two hypotheses:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

The first witness's reports:
- \( P(E_1|H_1) = 0.80 \) (correctly identifies an attacker of height 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1|H_2) = 0.20 \) (incorrectly identifies an attacker of height shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)

The second witness's reports:
- \( P(E_2|H_2) = 0.70 \) (correctly identifies an attacker of height shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_2|H_1) = 0.30 \) (incorrectly identifies an attacker of height 185 cm or taller as shorter)

We need to find \( P(H_1|E_1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claims so.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1|E_1) = \frac{P(E_1|H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

First, compute \( P(E_1) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1|H_1) P(H_1) + P(E_1|H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1|E_1) \):
\[ P(H_1|E_1) = \frac{P(E_1|H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]
\[ P(H_1|E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1|E_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
