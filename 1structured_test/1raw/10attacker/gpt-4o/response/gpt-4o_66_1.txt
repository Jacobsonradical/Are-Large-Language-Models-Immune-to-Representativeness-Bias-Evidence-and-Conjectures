To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis \( H \) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence \( E \) is the testimonies of the witnesses.

Given:

- \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85.
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) \): The probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.8.
- \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the first witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.2.
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) \): The probability that the second witness would say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.3.
- \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \): The probability that the second witness would say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.7.
- We need to find \( P(H \mid E_1 \text{ and } E_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid H) \) and \( P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid \neg H) \):

\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, to get \( P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2) \):

\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(H \mid E_1 \text{ and } E_2) \):

\[ P(H \mid E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.2323 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.2323 \} \]
