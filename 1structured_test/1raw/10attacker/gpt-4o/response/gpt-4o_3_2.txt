To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian reasoning. We'll define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1S \): The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_2T \): The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We'll use the following probabilities given in the problem:
- The prior probability \( P(T) = 0.15 \) and \( P(S) = 0.85 \).
- The first witness's accuracies: \( P(W_1T | T) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1S | T) = 0.2 \), \( P(W_1T | S) = 0.2 \), \( P(W_1S | S) = 0.8 \).
- The second witness's accuracies: \( P(W_2T | T) = 0.7 \), \( P(W_2S | T) = 0.3 \), \( P(W_2T | S) = 0.3 \), \( P(W_2S | S) = 0.7 \).

We are given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller (\( W_1T \)) and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (\( W_2S \)). We want to find the posterior probability \( P(T | W_1T, W_2S) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1T, W_2S) = \frac{P(W_1T, W_2S | T) P(T)}{P(W_1T, W_2S)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1T, W_2S | T) \):

\[ P(W_1T, W_2S | T) = P(W_1T | T) P(W_2S | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1T, W_2S | S) \):

\[ P(W_1T, W_2S | S) = P(W_1T | S) P(W_2S | S) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate the marginal probability \( P(W_1T, W_2S) \):

\[ P(W_1T, W_2S) = P(W_1T, W_2S | T) P(T) + P(W_1T, W_2S | S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1T, W_2S) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1T, W_2S) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(T | W_1T, W_2S) \):

\[ P(T | W_1T, W_2S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
