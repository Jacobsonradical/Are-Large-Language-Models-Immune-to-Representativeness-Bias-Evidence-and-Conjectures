To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we need to consider both the prior probability based on the city's population and the likelihood of the witnesses' statements. We will use Bayes' Theorem to combine these pieces of information.

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) \) = 0.15.
   - The probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(S) \) = 0.85.

2. **Likelihood:**
   - Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(W_1|T) \) = 0.80.
   - Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(W_1|S) \) = 0.20.
   - Given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(W_2|T) \) = 0.30.
   - Given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(W_2|S) \) = 0.70.

3. **Joint Likelihood:**
   - The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given this evidence:

\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | S) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
