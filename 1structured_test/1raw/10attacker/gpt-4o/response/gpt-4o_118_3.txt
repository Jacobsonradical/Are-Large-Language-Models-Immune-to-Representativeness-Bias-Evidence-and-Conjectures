We will use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:
- \( H_t \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \)
- The first witness's accuracy: \( P(W_1 | H_t) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1 | H_s) = 0.20 \)
- The second witness's accuracy: \( P(W_2 | H_t) = 0.70 \) and \( P(W_2 | H_s) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate \( P(H_t | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_t | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_t) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_s) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_t) = P(W_1 | H_t) \cdot P(W_2 | H_t) = 0.80 \times 0.70 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_s) = P(W_1 | H_s) \cdot P(W_2 | H_s) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.56 \times 0.15) + (0.06 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_t | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H_t | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.622.
