To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) for the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) for the event that the attacker’s height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) for the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) for the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find the updated probability \( P(T | W1, W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

Given probabilities:
1. \( P(T) = \text{prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller} = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(S) = \text{prior probability that someone in the city is shorter than 185 cm} = 0.85 \)

Conditional probabilities based on witness accuracy:
1. \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
3. \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)
4. \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

We use Bayes' Theorem to compute \( P(T | W1, W2) \):

\[
P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)}
\]

Where \( P(W1, W2) \) is the total probability of both witnesses' statements:

\[
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Since witnesses are assumed to provide independent identification:

\[
P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Therefore:

\[
P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, the posterior probability is:

\[
P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

The estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.232.

So, the answer in the desired format is:

{probability: 0.232}
