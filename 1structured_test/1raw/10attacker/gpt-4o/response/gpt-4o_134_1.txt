To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) : The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) : The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) : The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \):

\[ P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \] (accuracy of first witness for 185 cm or taller)
\[ P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \] (accuracy of second witness for shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witnesses' assessments are assumed independent given the height of the attacker:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) \):

\[ P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \] (error rate of first witness for shorter than 185 cm)
\[ P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \] (accuracy of second witness for shorter than 185 cm)

Since the witnesses' assessments are assumed independent given the height of the attacker:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Given that:

\[ P(H) = 0.15 \] (proportion of the population 185 cm or taller)
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \] (proportion of the population shorter than 185 cm)

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
