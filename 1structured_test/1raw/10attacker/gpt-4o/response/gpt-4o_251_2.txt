To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses and population statistics, we can use Bayesian inference.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness's claim (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( W_2 \): The second witness's claim (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We are interested in \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Given information includes:
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, we have:

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \times P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, \( P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \times P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, using the law of total probability, we'll calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
