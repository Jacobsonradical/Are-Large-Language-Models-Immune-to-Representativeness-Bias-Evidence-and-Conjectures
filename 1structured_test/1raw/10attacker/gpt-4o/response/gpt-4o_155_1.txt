To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( L \) represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We are given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracies, so we can incorporate these into our calculation.

### Known Probabilities

1. Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(H) = 0.15
   \]

2. Probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(L) = 0.85
   \]

3. Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W1|H) = 0.80
   \]

4. Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(W1|L) = 0.20
   \]

5. Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(W2|H) = 0.30
   \]

6. Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(W2|L) = 0.70
   \]

### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(H|W1 \text{ claims } H) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ claims } H|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ claims } H)}
\]

We need to calculate \( P(W1 \text{ claims } H) \):

\[
P(W1 \text{ claims } H) = P(W1 \text{ claims } H | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ claims } H | L) \cdot P(L)
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
P(W1 \text{ claims } H) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

Calculating:
\[
P(W1 \text{ claims } H) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H|W1 \text{ claims } H) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
