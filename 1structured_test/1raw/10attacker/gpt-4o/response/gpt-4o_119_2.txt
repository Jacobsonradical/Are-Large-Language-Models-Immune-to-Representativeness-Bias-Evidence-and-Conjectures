To answer the question, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the prior probability of the attacker's height with the evidence provided by the witnesses. Here are the steps for the calculation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( S \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \) (because \( 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 \))
   - \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

3. **Calculate the combined evidence from both witnesses:**
   \[
   P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
   \]
   where
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24,
   \]
   and
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14.
   \]

4. **Calculate the total probability of the joint evidence \( P(W_1, W_2) \):**
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155.
   \]

5. **Finally, calculate \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \):**
   \[
   P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232.
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the combined witness testimony, is approximately 0.232.

\[
\{probability: 0.232\}
\]
