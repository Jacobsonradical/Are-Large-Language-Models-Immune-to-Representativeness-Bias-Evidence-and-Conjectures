To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:

- \( H_t \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_t) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_s) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_s) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_t) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(H_t | W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_t | W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2)} \]

The denominator can be expanded as:

\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2 | H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2 | H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]

Considering \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are conditionally independent given \( H_t \) or \( H_s \):

\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2 | H_t) = P(W_1 | H_t) \cdot P(W_2 | H_t) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2 | H_s) = P(W_1 | H_s) \cdot P(W_2 | H_s) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we can compute \( P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus, the desired probability is:

\[ P(H_t | W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
