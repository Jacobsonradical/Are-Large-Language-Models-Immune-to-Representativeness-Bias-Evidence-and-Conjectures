To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{T} \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{S} \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_{T} \mid T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1_{T} \mid S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2_{S} \mid S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2_{S} \mid T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find the joint probability of both witnesses' observations and the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller.

First, let's calculate:

1. **Joint Probability** for the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and both witnesses' observations aligning with this height (\( P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{T}) \)):

\[ P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{T}) = P(T) \times P(W1_{T} \mid T) \times P(W2_{S} \mid T) \]
\[ P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{T}) = 0.15 \times 0.80 \times 0.30 \]
\[ P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{T}) = 0.15 \times 0.24 = 0.036 \]

2. **Joint Probability** for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, and both witnesses' observations aligning with this height (\( P(S, W1_{S}, W2_{S}) \)):

\[ P(S, W1_{S}, W2_{S}) = P(S) \times P(W1_{T} \mid S) \times P(W2_{S} \mid S) \]
\[ P(S, W1_{S}, W2_{S}) = 0.85 \times 0.20 \times 0.70 \]
\[ P(S, W1_{S}, W2_{S}) = 0.85 \times 0.14 = 0.119 \]

3. **Normalization Factor**: Sum of all these probabilities:

\[ P(W1_{T}, W2_{S}) = P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{T}) + P(S, W1_{S}, W2_{S}) \]
\[ P(W1_{T}, W2_{S}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statement combinations (\( P(T \mid W1_{T}, W2_{S}) \)):

\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}, W2_{S}) = \frac{P(T, W1_{T}, W2_{S})}{P(W1_{T}, W2_{S})} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}, W2_{S}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(T \mid W1_{T}, W2_{S}) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
