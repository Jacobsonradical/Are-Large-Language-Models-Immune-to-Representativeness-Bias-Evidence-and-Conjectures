To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and the population proportion, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s how we can solve the problem step by step:

1. Define the events:
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2_S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Given data:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies \( T \))
   - \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies \( S \) as \( T \))
   - \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies \( S \))
   - \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies \( T \) as \( S \))

3. We want to find \( P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' reports.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T \cap W2_S)}
\]

4. We need to find \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \) and \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S) \):

\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

5. Using the law of total probability for \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S) \):

\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S) = P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T \cap W2_S | S) \cdot P(S)
\]

\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

6. Finally, compute \( P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) \):

\[
P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, our estimate is:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
