To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and population data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can approach the problem:

Define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{T} \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_{S} \): First witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_{T} \): Second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{S} \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- The first witness's accuracy:
  - \( P(W1_{T} | T) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W1_{S} | S) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W1_{T} | S) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(W1_{S} | T) = 0.20 \)

Let's consider the probability \( P(T | W1_{T}) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_{T}) = \frac{P(W1_{T} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_{T})} \]

To find \( P(W1_{T}) \), we can use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_{T}) = P(W1_{T} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_{T} | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(T | W1_{T}) \):

\[ P(T | W1_{T}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_{T}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1_{T}) \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[
\{probability: 0.4138\}
