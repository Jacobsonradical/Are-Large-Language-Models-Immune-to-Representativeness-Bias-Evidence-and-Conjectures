We can solve this using Bayes' theorem. Let's designate the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1H \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2L \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A|W1H, W2L) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1H | A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1H | B) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2L | A) = 0.30 \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being shorter)
- \( P(W2L | B) = 0.70 \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) = \frac{ P(W1H, W2L | A) P(A) }{ P(W1H, W2L | A) P(A) + P(W1H, W2L | B) P(B) } \]

We need to find \( P(W1H, W2L | A) \) and \( P(W1H, W2L | B) \):

\[ P(W1H, W2L | A) = P(W1H | A) \times P(W2L | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1H, W2L | B) = P(W1H | B) \times P(W2L | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now apply these to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) = \frac{ 0.24 \times 0.15 }{ (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) } \]
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) = \frac{ 0.036 }{ 0.036 + 0.119 } \]
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) = \frac{ 0.036 }{ 0.155 } \]
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) = \frac{ 36 }{ 155 } \]
\[ P(A | W1H, W2L) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the witnesses' statements, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
