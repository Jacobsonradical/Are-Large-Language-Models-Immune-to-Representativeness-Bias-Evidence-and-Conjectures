To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Define the Probabilities

1. **Prior Probability:**
   - \( P(\text{Tall}) = 0.15 \) (The probability that any randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\text{Short}) = 0.85 \) (The probability that any randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Witnesses' Accuracy:**
   - **First witness:**
     - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Tall}) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{First says Tall}) = 0.20 \)
     - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Short}) = 0.20 \)
     - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{First says Short}) = 0.80 \)
   - **Second witness:**
     - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Second says Tall}) = 0.70 \)
     - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{Second says Tall}) = 0.30 \)
     - \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{Second says Short}) = 0.30 \)
     - \( P(\text{Short} | \text{Second says Short}) = 0.70 \)

### Step 2: Set Up Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

We need to find \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) \)

We need to combine the probabilities from both witnesses:

1. **P(First says Tall and Second says Short | Tall):**
   \[ P(\text{First says Tall} | \text{Tall}) \times P(\text{Second says Short} | \text{Tall}) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. **P(First says Tall and Second says Short | Short):**
   \[ P(\text{First says Tall} | \text{Short}) \times P(\text{Second says Short} | \text{Short}) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

### Step 4: Use Law of Total Probability

\[ P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) = P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall}) + P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short} | \text{Short}) \cdot P(\text{Short}) \]

\[ P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Posterior Probability \( P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) \)

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) = \frac{P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short} | \text{Tall}) \cdot P(\text{Tall})}{P(\text{First says Tall and Second says Short})} \]

\[ P(\text{Tall} | \text{First says Tall and Second says Short}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

### Conclusion

{probability: 0.232}
