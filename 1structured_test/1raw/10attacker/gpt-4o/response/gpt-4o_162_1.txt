To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and the information about the population, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

First, let's set up the given probabilities:

### Prior Probabilities
\[
P(H) = 0.15
\]
\[
P(\neg H) = 0.85
\]

### Likelihoods for the first witness
\[
P(W_1 | H) = 0.80
\]
\[
P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20
\]

### Likelihoods for the second witness
\[
P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 
\]
\[
P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 
\]

We can now apply Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probabilities \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \) and \( P(\neg H | W_1, W_2) \).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem

First, we need the joint likelihood for both witnesses:

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Next, we use these joint likelihoods to find the normalizing constant, \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
