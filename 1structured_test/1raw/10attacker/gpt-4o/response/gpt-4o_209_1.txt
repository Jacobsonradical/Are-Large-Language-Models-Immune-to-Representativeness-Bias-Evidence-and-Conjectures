To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we will apply Bayes’ Theorem, which provides a way to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. We want to find \( P(H_1 | E) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witnesses.

Bayes’ Theorem states:

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(E | H_1) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_1) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

First, let’s compute each part:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods:**
   - The first witness identifies the correct height 80% of the time:
     - \( P(W1_correct | H_1) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(W1_correct | H_2) = 0.20 \)
   - The second witness identifies the correct height 70% of the time:
     - \( P(W2_correct | H_1) = 0.30 \)
     - \( P(W2_correct | H_2) = 0.70 \)

3. **Combine the likelihoods:**
   - \( P(E | H_1) = P(W1_correct | H_1) \cdot P(W2_correct | H_1) \)
     - \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(E | H_2) = P(W1_correct | H_2) \cdot P(W2_correct | H_2) \)
     - \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Total Probability of Evidence:**
   - \( P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \)
     - \( P(E) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \)
     - \( P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Now, we can find \( P(H_1 | E) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.232 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed is:

{probability: 0.232}
