To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies and the given population statistics, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( A_1 \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(A_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Let:
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We also have:
- \( P(W_1 | A_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | A_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A_2) = 0.70 \)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements \( P(A_1 | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

First, we compute \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_1) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_2) \):
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_1) = P(W_1 | A_1) \cdot P(W_2 | A_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_2) = P(W_1 | A_2) \cdot P(W_2 | A_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A_1 | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_1) \cdot P(A_1)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
where
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_1) \cdot P(A_1) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A_2) \cdot P(A_2) \]

Thus,
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally,
\[ P(A_1 | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately:
\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
