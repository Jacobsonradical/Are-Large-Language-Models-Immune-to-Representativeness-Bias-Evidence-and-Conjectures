To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and their reliability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Given:
1. The first witness's reliability:
   - Probability of correctly identifying 185 cm or taller (Witness 1 is correct): \(P(C1|T1) = 0.8\)
   - Probability of erroneously identifying 185 cm or taller (Witness 1 is incorrect): \(P(C1|T<185) = 0.2\)

2. The second witness's reliability:
   - Probability of correctly identifying shorter than 185 cm (Witness 2 is correct): \(P(C2|T<185) = 0.7\)
   - Probability of erroneously identifying shorter than 185 cm (Witness 2 is incorrect): \(P(C2|T1) = 0.3\)

3. Prior probabilities (based on population data):
   - Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller: \(P(T1) = 0.15\)
   - Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm: \(P(T<185) = 0.85\)

We want to find \(P(T1|C1, C2)\), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T1|C1, C2) = \frac{P(C1, C2|T1) \cdot P(T1)}{P(C1, C2)} \]

Where,

\[ P(C1, C2|T1) = P(C1|T1) \times P(C2|T1) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(C1, C2|T<185) = P(C1|T<185) \times P(C2|T<185) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(C1, C2) = P(C1, C2|T1) \cdot P(T1) + P(C1, C2|T<185) \cdot P(T<185) \]

\[ P(C1, C2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(C1, C2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]

\[ P(C1, C2) = 0.155 \]

Now combining these:

\[ P(T1|C1, C2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(T1|C1, C2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(T1|C1, C2) = 0.2323 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim and evidence from the second witness is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.2323 \} \]
