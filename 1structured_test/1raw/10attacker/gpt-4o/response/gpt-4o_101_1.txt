To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

Given:
- \( P(H1) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H2) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 1's accuracy:
  - \( P(W1|H1) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W1|H2) = 0.20 \)
- Witness 2's accuracy:
  - \( P(W2|H2) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(W2|H1) = 0.30 \)

First, we need to calculate the combined probability of witnessing data using Bayes' theorem.

The event \( E \) is having one witness say the attacker is 185 cm or taller and another say the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

### Step 1: Calculate \( P(E|H1) \) and \( P(E|H2) \).
- When the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( H1 \)):
  \[
  P(E|H1) = P(W1|H1) \cdot P(W2|H2) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
  \]
- When the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( H2 \)):
  \[
  P(E|H2) = P(W1|H2) \cdot P(W2|H2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(E) \):
\[
P(E) = P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(E|H2) \cdot P(H2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

### Step 3: Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{P(E|H1) \cdot P(H1)}{P(E)}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
P(H1|E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.232 \} \]
