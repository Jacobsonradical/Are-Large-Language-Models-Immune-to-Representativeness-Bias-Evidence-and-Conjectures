To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and the accuracy of their height recognition, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( H \geq 185 \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller
   - \( H < 185 \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
   - \( W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \): First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
   - \( W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \): Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \)
   - \( P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \mid H < 185) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \mid H < 185) = 0.7 \)
   - \( P(W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.3 \)

3. **Using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \geq 185 \mid W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \text{ and } W2 \text{ says } H < 185) \):**

   We want to find:
   \[
   P(H \geq 185 \mid W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \text{ and } W2 \text{ says } H < 185)
   \]

   By definition of conditional probability:
   \[
   P(H \geq 185 \mid W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \text{ and } W2 \text{ says } H < 185) = \frac{P(H \geq 185 \cap W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185)}{P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185)}
   \]

4. **Calculate the numerator \( P(H \geq 185 \cap W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185) \):**

   \[
   P(H \geq 185 \cap W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185) = P(H \geq 185) P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) P(W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \mid H \geq 185)
   \]

   \[
   = 0.15 \times 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.036
   \]

5. **Calculate the denominator \( P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185) \):**

   \[
   P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \cap W2 \text{ says } H < 185) = P(H \geq 185) P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \mid H \geq 185) P(W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \mid H \geq 185) + P(H < 185) P(W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \mid H < 185) P(W2 \text{ says } H < 185 \mid H < 185)
   \]

   \[
   = (0.15 \times 0.8 \times 0.3) + (0.85 \times 0.2 \times 0.7) 
   \]

   \[
   = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

6. **Calculate the desired probability:**

   \[
   P(H \geq 185 \mid W1 \text{ says } H \geq 185 \text{ and } W2 \text{ says } H < 185) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}
\]
