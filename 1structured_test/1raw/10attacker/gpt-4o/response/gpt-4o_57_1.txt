To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided by the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events and their probabilities:

- \( H_{185+} \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_{<185} \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{185+} \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{<185} \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know from the problem statement:

1. P(\( H_{185+} \)) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
2. P(\( H_{<185} \)) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
3. P(\( W1_{185+} | H_{185+} \)) = 0.80 (80% accuracy for the first witness when the height is 185 cm or taller).
4. P(\( W1_{185+} | H_{<185} \)) = 0.20 (20% error rate for the first witness when the height is shorter than 185 cm).
5. P(\( W2_{<185} | H_{185+} \)) = 0.30 (30% error rate for the second witness when the height is 185 cm or taller).
6. P(\( W2_{<185} | H_{<185} \)) = 0.70 (70% accuracy for the second witness when the height is shorter than 185 cm).

We need to calculate the posterior probability P(\( H_{185+} | W1_{185+} \)), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_{185+} | W1_{185+}) = \frac{P(W1_{185+} | H_{185+}) \cdot P(H_{185+})}{P(W1_{185+})} \]

Where \( P(W1_{185+}) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1_{185+}) = P(W1_{185+} | H_{185+}) \cdot P(H_{185+}) + P(W1_{185+} | H_{<185}) \cdot P(H_{<185}) \]

Plugging the values:
\[ P(W1_{185+}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_{185+}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_{185+}) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find the posterior probability:
\[ P(H_{185+} | W1_{185+}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{185+} | W1_{185+}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_{185+} | W1_{185+}) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
