To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(S\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W1\): The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W2\): The second witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the information we have:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(S) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W1|T) = 0.8\) (first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \(P(W1|S) = 0.2\) (first witness incorrectly identifies as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \(P(W2|T) = 0.3\) (second witness incorrectly identifies as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- \(P(W2|S) = 0.7\) (second witness correctly identifies as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Our goal is to calculate \(P(T|W1)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says so. This is given by Bayes' theorem:

\[P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)}\]

We also need \(P(W1)\), which can be determined using the law of total probability:

\[P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S)\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85)\]
\[P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(W1) = 0.29\]

Now, calculate \(P(T|W1)\):

\[P(T|W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(T|W1) \approx 0.414\]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
