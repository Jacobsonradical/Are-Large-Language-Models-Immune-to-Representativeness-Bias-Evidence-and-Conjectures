To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller (\( P(H_1) = 0.15 \))
- \( H_2 \): The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(H_2) = 0.85 \))
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We need to find \( P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

First, we need the joint probability \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \):

Given \( H_1 \) (attacker is 185 cm or taller):
- The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.8.
- The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.3.

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Now, we need the joint probability \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) \):

Given \( H_2 \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
- The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller is 0.2.
- The probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm is 0.7.

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
