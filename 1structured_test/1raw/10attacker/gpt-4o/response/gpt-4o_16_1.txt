Let's denote the hypotheses and the witness testimonies as follows:

- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
- \(P(H_2) = 0.85\)
- \(P(E_1|H_1) = 0.80\)
- \(P(E_1|H_2) = 0.20\)
- \(P(E_2|H_1) = 0.30\)
- \(P(E_2|H_2) = 0.70\)

We aim to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, i.e., \(P(H_1 | E_1)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \(P(E_1)\):

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \(P(H_1 | E_1)\):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.
