To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information given, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- Prior probability of \( H \): \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability of \( L \): \( P(L) = 0.85 \)
- Probability that the first witness correctly identifies height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \)
- Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies height if the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_1 \mid L) = 0.20 \)
- Probability that the second witness correctly identifies height if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_2 \mid L) = 0.70 \)
- Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies height if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \)

We need to calculate the posterior probability \( P(H \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness's claim, calculated as:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \mid L) \cdot P(L) \]

Now, substituting the values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is approximately:

{probability: 0.41}
