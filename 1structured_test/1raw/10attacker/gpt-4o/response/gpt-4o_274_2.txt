To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. Define the probabilities:
   - \( P(T) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(S) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1_T \): Probability that the first witness says 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W1_S \): Probability that the first witness says shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W2_T \): Probability that the second witness says 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2_S \): Probability that the second witness says shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. From the data provided:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - \( W1_T = 0.80 \)
   - \( W1_S = 0.70 \)
   - Therefore, \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \), \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
   - Therefore, \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \), \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)

3. We are to find the posterior probability \( P(T|W1 \text{ says } T, W2 \text{ says } S) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \cdot P(T) }{ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) } \]

Where:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

So, combining all these:

\[ P(T|W1 \text{ says } T, W2 \text{ says } S) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85} \]

\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119}  \]

\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So our estimate is:

\[ { probability: 0.232 } \]
