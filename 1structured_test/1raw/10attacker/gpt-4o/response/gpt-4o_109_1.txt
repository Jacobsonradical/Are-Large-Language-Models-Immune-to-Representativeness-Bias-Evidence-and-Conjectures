To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following probabilities:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm)

### Witness 1

- \( P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+} | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+} | B) = 0.20 \)

### Witness 2

- \( P(\text{Witness 2 says <185 cm} | A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\text{Witness 2 says <185 cm} | B) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(A | \text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm}) \).

First, we calculate the joint probabilities of the witnesses' statements under both scenarios:

1. When the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm} | A) = P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+} | A) \times P(\text{Witness 2 says <185 cm} | A)
   \]
   \[
   = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
   \]

2. When the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
   \[
   P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm} | B) = P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+} | B) \times P(\text{Witness 2 says <185 cm} | B)
   \]
   \[
   = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
   \]

Then, we use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:

\[
P(A | \text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm}) = \frac{P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm} | A) \times P(A)}{P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm})}
\]

We need the denominator \( P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm}) \):

\[
P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm}) = P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm} | A) \times P(A) + P(\text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm} | B) \times P(B)
\]

\[
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
\]

\[
= 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we calculate the desired probability:

\[
P(A | \text{Witness 1 says 185 cm+ and Witness 2 says <185 cm}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.232}
