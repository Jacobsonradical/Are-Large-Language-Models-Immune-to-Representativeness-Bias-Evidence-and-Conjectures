To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the two witnesses and the population data, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \).

Given:
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

We want to find the posterior probability: \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \).

First, we'll calculate the joint probability of the witnesses' claims given each hypothesis.

1. For \( H_1 \):
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) \]
\[ = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. For \( H_2 \):
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) \]
\[ = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we calculate the total probability of the evidence:
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) \times P(H_2) \]
\[ = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements is roughly 0.23.

So, the answer is:
{probability: 0.23}
