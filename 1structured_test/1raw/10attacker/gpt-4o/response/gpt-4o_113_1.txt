To estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and population data, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

We'll use the following notation:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness said the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time)
- \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time)
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies height 30% of the time)

We aim to find \( P(H_1 | E_1) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E_1) \), the total probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1)P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2)P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H_1 | E_1) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
