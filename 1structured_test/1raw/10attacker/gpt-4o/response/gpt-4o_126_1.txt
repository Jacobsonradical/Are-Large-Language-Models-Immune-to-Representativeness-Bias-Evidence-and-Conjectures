To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we'll use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies. Using Bayes' Theorem and combining both witnesses' testimonies, the joint probability can be resolved to:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

Where \( P(E_1, E_2) \) is the total probability of both events happening.

First, we calculate the individual components:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihood of witness statements given the attacker's height:**
   - \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

3. **Joint probabilities:**
   - \( P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Then, by combining the probabilities according to Bayes' Theorem, the total probability \( P(E_1, E_2) \):

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E_1, E_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{(0.24 \times 0.15)}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the combined testimonies of the witnesses, is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
