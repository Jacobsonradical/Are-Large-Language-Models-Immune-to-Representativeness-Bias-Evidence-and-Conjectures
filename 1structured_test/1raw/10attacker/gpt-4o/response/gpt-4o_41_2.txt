To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): First witness claims the attacker was taller.
- \( W2_T \): Second witness claims the attacker was taller.
- \( W2_S \): Second witness claims the attacker was shorter.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person from the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability that a random person from the city is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W1_T | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness accurately identifies a taller person).
- \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller).
- \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness accurately identifies a shorter person).
- \( P(W2_S | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a taller person as shorter).

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | H) P(H)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W1_T, W2_S | H) \) and \( P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \).

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | H) = P(W1_T | H) \times P(W2_S | H) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \times P(W2_S | S) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we can find \( P(W1_T, W2_S) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | H) P(H) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(H | W1_T, W2_S) \):

\[ P(H | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | H) P(H)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} \]
\[ P(H | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1_T, W2_S) = 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim and the second witnessâ€™s contradiction is:

{probability: 0.232}
