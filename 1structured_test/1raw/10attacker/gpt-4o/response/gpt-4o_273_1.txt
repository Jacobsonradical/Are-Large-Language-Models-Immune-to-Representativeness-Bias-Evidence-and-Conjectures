To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the population.
- \( P(B) \) is the overall probability that the witness would say the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given the information:
- First witness (correct 80% of the time, incorrect 20%):
  - \( P(E_1 | H \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(E_1 | H < 185) = 0.20 \)

- Second witness (correct 70% of the time, incorrect 30%):
  - \( P(E_2 | H < 185) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(E_2 | H \geq 185) = 0.30 \)

- Height statistics in the population:
  - \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
  - \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \)

We are only considering the first witness who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Bayes' theorem for the first witness is:

\[ P(H \geq 185 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(E_1)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(E_1) \):

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(E_1 | H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H \geq 185 | E_1) \):

\[ P(H \geq 185 | E_1) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
