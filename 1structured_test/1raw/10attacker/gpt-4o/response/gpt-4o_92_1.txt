To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the events:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) is the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | B) = 0.70 \)

We are interested in finding the posterior probability \( P(A | W_1) \), i.e., the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims this to be true. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

The term \( P(W_1) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
