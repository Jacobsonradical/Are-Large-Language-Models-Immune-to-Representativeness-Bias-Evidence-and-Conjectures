To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
- \(P(H_2) = 0.85\)
- \(P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80\)
- \(P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20\)
- \(P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30\)
- \(P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70\)

We want to find \(P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter.

Using Bayes' theorem, we derive:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]

First, we need the joint likelihoods:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) \]

So:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, combining with priors to find the denominator:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
