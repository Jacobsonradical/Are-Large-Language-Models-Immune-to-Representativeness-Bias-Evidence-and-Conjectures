To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now we know the following probabilities:

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

2. **Conditional probabilities for the first witness**:
   - \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)

3. **Conditional probabilities for the second witness**:
   - \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \).

First, let's find the joint probabilities using Bayes' theorem. The joint probability denominator is:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_1)P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_2)P(H_2) \]

Where:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) \]

So, we need to calculate:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) = (0.80) \cdot (0.30) = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H_2) = (0.20) \cdot (0.70) = 0.14 \]

Now, the joint probabilities:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( \boxed{0.232} \).
