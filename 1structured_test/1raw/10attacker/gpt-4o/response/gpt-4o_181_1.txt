To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the event:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

Let:
- \( W1_{T} \): The first witness claims the attacker is tall (185 cm or taller).
- \( W1_{S} \): The first witness claims the attacker is short (shorter than 185 cm).

We know:
- The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall person is \( P(W1_{T} | A) = 0.80 \).
- The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a tall person (i.e., identifies a short person as tall) is \( P(W1_{T} | B) = 0.20 \).

We need to find:
\[ P(A | W1_{T}) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W1_{T}) = \frac{P(W1_{T} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1_{T})} \]

To find \( P(W1_{T}) \):
\[ P(W1_{T}) = P(W1_{T} | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1_{T} | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_{T}) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can compute \( P(A | W1_{T}) \):
\[ P(A | W1_{T}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W1_{T}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W1_{T}) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.414.
