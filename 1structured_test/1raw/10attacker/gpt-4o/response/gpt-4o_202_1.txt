To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information by the two witnesses and their accuracy rates, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(S\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1^{+}\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2^{-} \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are provided with the following probabilities:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(S) = 0.85\)
- \(P(W_1^{+} | T) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W_1^{+} | S) = 0.20\)
- \(P(W_2^{-} | T) = 0.30\)
- \(P(W_2^{-} | S) = 0.70\)

We need to find \(P(T | W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-})\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-}) = \frac{P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-} | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-})} \]

First, let's calculate the joint probabilities:
\[ P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-} | T) = P(W_1^{+} | T) \cdot P(W_2^{-} | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-} | S) = P(W_1^{+} | S) \cdot P(W_2^{-} | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, use the law of total probability to find \(P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-})\):
\[ P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-}) = P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-} | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate the required conditional probability:
\[ P(T | W_1^{+} \text{ and } W_2^{-}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
