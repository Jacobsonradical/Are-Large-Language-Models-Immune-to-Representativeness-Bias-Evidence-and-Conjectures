To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.7 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(T) \cdot P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

Where \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(T) \cdot P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) + P(S) \cdot P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) \]

Now, we can plug in the known values:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.15 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.3) + (0.85 \cdot 0.2 \cdot 0.7) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.155 \]

Now we can find \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.15 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.3}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is given by:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
