To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements and the given population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( H_1 \) : The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) : The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) : The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) : The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

To find \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
