To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem.

Given the witnesses' reliability and the distribution of heights in the population, we need:

- P(A|W1 & W2): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.
- P(W1 & W2|A): Probability of both witnesses' testimonies given attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- P(A): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on population data (15%).
- P(W1 | A): Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are.
- P(W2 | A): Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that they are 185 cm or taller.

First, define our terms:
- A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B: Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- W1: First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem:
- P(A) = 0.15
- P(B) = 0.85
- P(W1 | A) = 0.80
- P(W1 | B) = 0.20
- P(W2 | A) = 0.30
- P(W2 | B) = 0.70

Bayes' theorem states:
\[
P(A | W1 \& W2) = \frac{P(W1 \& W2 | A) P(A)}{P(W1 \& W2)}
\]

First, we need to find \(P(W1 \& W2 | A)\):
\[
P(W1 \& W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \times P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

Next, find \(P(W1 \& W2 | B)\):
\[
P(W1 \& W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \times P(W2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, the total probability of \(W1 \& W2\):
\[
P(W1 \& W2) = P(W1 \& W2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W1 \& W2 | B) \times P(B) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W1 \& W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[{probability: 0.232}\]
