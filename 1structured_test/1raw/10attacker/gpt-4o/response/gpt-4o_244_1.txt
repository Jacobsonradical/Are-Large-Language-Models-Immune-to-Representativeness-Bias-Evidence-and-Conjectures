To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( \neg W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given the following probabilities:

1. \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
3. \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.8 \)
4. \( P(\neg W_1 \mid T) = 0.2 \)
5. \( P(W_1 \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \)
6. \( P(\neg W_1 \mid \neg T) = 0.8 \)
7. \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.3 \)
8. \( P(\neg W_2 \mid T) = 0.7 \)
9. \( P(W_2 \mid \neg T) = 0.7 \)
10. \( P(\neg W_2 \mid \neg T) = 0.3 \)

We want to find \( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability, we have:

\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, we find \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we find \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) = P(W_1 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Then, using the law of total probability, we find \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ { "probability": 0.2323 } \]
