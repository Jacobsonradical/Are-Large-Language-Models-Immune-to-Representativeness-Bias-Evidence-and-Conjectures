To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(H|W1, W2) \): the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, let's find \( P(W1, W2|H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(W2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, let's find \( P(W1, W2|\neg H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2|\neg H) = P(W1|\neg H) \cdot P(W2|\neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we need the denominator \( P(W1, W2) \). Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H|W1, W2) \):
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.232 \).

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
