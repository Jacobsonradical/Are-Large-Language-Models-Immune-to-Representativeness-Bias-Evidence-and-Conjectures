To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. The information available can be summarized as follows:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - \( P(T) \) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
   - \( P(S) \) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

2. Witness reliability:
   - First witness:
     - \( P(W1|T) \) = Probability that the first witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are = 0.8
     - \( P(W1|S) \) = Probability that the first witness identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter = 0.2
   - Second witness:
     - \( P(W2|T) \) = Probability that the second witness identifies the person as shorter given that they are taller = 0.3 (since 70% correctly identify as taller)
     - \( P(W2|S) \) = Probability that the second witness identifies the person as shorter given that they are shorter = 0.7

We need to find \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the person is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

where

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Calculating \( P(W1) \):

\[ P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculating \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer is:

\{probability: 0.4138\}
