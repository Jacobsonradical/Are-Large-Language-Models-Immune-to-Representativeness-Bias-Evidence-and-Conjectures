We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, denoted as \( H \).

Given:

1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) — the prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) — the prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
3. The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time:
   - \( P(\text{First witness says H} | H) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{First witness says H} | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
4. The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time:
   - \( P(\text{Second witness says H} | H) = 0.30 \) (because the second witness said shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(\text{Second witness says H} | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(H | \text{Both witnesses' claims}) \).

First, we combine the information from both witnesses to get the likelihood:

\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | H) = P(\text{First witness says H} | H) \times P(\text{Second witness says not H} | H) \]
\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | \neg H) = P(\text{First witness says H} | \neg H) \times P(\text{Second witness says not H} | \neg H) \]
\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | \text{Both witnesses' claims}) = \frac{P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | H) \times P(H)}{P(\text{Both witnesses' claims})} \]

\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims}) = P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | H) \times P(H) + P(\text{Both witnesses' claims} | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{Both witnesses' claims}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:

\[ P(H | \text{Both witnesses' claims}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
