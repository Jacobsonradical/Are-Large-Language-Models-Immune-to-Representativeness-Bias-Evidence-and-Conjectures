We can use Bayes' theorem to determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

Define the following events:
- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given probabilities:
\[ P(T) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg T) = 0.85 \]

Witness accuracies:
\[ P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \]
\[ P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \]

We need to compute \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \) â€” the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, calculate the likelihoods:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, find the total probability of both witnesses' claims \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg T) P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
