To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and their reliability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in \( P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem and considering both witnesses' statements, we get:

\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

Let's break it down:

1. Find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) \]
\[ = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. Find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) \]
\[ = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

3. Use the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

4. Finally, calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(H_1 | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ = 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and their reliability, is approximately 0.232.
