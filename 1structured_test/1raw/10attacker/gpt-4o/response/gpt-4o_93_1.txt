To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( A \): The first witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The second witness stating the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H|A, \neg B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|A, \neg B) = \frac{P(A, \neg B|H) P(H)}{P(A, \neg B)} \]

First, let's identify the components:

1. \( P(H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15.
2. \( P(\neg H) \): The prior probability that a randomly selected person in the city is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

Next, let's calculate the likelihoods:

1. \( P(A|H) \): The probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.80.
2. \( P(A|\neg H) \): The probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.20.
3. \( P(\neg B|H) \): The probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 0.30.
4. \( P(\neg B|\neg H) \): The probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.70.

The combined likelihoods are:

\[ P(A, \neg B|H) = P(A|H) \cdot P(\neg B|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(A, \neg B|\neg H) = P(A|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg B|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we need the total probability \( P(A, \neg B) \):

\[ P(A, \neg B) = P(A, \neg B|H) P(H) + P(A, \neg B|\neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(A, \neg B) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(A, \neg B) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we compute:

\[ P(H|A, \neg B) = \frac{P(A, \neg B|H) P(H)}{P(A, \neg B)} \]
\[ P(H|A, \neg B) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|A, \neg B) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|A, \neg B) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as stated by the first witness, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
