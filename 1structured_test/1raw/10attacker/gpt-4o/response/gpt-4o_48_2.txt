To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (event \( H \)), we will employ Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( E \) represents the evidence provided by the witnesses. 

First, letâ€™s break down the required components:

1. **Prior probability** \( P(H) \):
   - From information "b", 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller.
   \[ P(H) = 0.15 \]

   - The complement (person being shorter than 185 cm) is:
   \[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

2. **Likelihood of evidence given the hypotheses** \( P(E | H) \) and \( P(E | \neg H) \):
   - \( E \) can be broken down into \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) where \( E_1 \) is the evidence given by the first witness, and \( E_2 \) is the evidence given by the second witness.
   - For \( E_1 \) (first witness's claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
     - Correct identification by first witness when \( H \) is true (attack was 185 cm or taller): 80%
     \[ P(E_1 | H) = 0.8 \]
     - Incorrect identification by first witness when \( H \) is false (attack was shorter than 185 cm): 20%
     \[ P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \]
   - For \( E_2 \) (second witness's claim the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
     - Correct identification by the second witness when \( \neg H \) is true (attack was shorter than 185 cm): 70%
     \[ P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \]
     - Incorrect identification by the second witness when \( \neg H \) is false (attack was 185 cm or taller): 30%
     \[ P(E_2 | H) = 0.3 \]

3. **Combined likelihood** \( P(E | H) \) and \( P(E | \neg H) \):
   - Since both witnesses are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities:
   \[ P(E | H) = P(E_1 | H) \times P(E_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
   \[ P(E | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \times P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

4. **Total probability of evidence** \( P(E) \):
   - Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(E) = P(E | H)P(H) + P(E | \neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

5. **Posterior probability** \( P(H | E) \):
   \[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H)P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.2323 \} \]
