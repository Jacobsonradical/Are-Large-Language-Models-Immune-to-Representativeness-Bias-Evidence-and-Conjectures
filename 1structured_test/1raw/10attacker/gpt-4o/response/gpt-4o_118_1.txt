To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which is formulated as: 

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the posterior probability of the hypothesis (that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) given the evidence (witness testimonies).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood of the evidence.

Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Define events
- \(H_1\): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): First witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): Second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

### Step 2: Assign probabilities based on the given data

- **Prior probabilities**:
  - \(P(H_1) = 0.15\)
  - \(P(H_2) = 0.85\)

- **Likelyhood:**
  - For the first witness (E1):
    - \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
    - \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
  - For the second witness (E2):
    - \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
    - \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the combined likelihoods
We need to calculate \( P(E | H_1) \) and \( P(E | H_2) \). This involves both pieces of evidence given our hypotheses:

\[ P(E | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the marginal likelihood \( P(E) \)

\[ P(E) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

### Step 5: Apply Bayes' theorem

\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
