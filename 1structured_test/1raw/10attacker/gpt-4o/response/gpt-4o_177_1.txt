We can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies from the two witnesses.

Let's define the following:
- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The given probabilities are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W1 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter).
- \( P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter).

We aim to find \( P(H \mid W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2 \mid H) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg H) \):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \times P(W2 \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg H) = P(W1 \mid \neg H) \times P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Next, we calculate the total probability \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we substitute back into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H \mid W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.232}
\]
