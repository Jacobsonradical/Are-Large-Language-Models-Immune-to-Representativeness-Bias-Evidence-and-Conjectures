To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Let's denote:
- \(A\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We have the following information:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(B) = 0.85\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm.

We have two witnesses:
- The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%, so:
  - \(P(\text{First witness says } A | A) = 0.8\)
  - \(P(\text{First witness says } A | B) = 0.2\)
- The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with an accuracy of 70%, so:
  - \(P(\text{Second witness says } B | B) = 0.7\)
  - \(P(\text{Second witness says } B | A) = 0.3\)

We want to find \(P(A | \text{First witness says } A)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | \text{First witness says } A) = \frac{P(\text{First witness says } A | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{First witness says } A)} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{First witness says } A) = P(\text{First witness says } A | A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{First witness says } A | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substitute the known values into the equations:

\[ P(\text{First witness says } A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{First witness says } A) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(\text{First witness says } A) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \(P(A | \text{First witness says } A)\):

\[ P(A | \text{First witness says } A) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | \text{First witness says } A) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | \text{First witness says } A) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness' claim, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
