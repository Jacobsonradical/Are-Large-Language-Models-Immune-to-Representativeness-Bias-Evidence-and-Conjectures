To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' reports and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg T \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1_{T} \): the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W2_{\neg T} \): the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the problem, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

The accuracy rates of the witnesses provide the following probabilities:

- \( P(W1_{T} \mid T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W1_{T} \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W2_{\neg T} \mid T) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W2_{\neg T} \mid \neg T) = 0.7 \)

We want to find \( P(T \mid W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T}) \). By Bayesâ€™ theorem, we need to calculate the joint likelihoods and normalize them:

\[ P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T} \mid T) = P(W1_{T} \mid T) \times P(W2_{\neg T} \mid T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T} \mid \neg T) = P(W1_{T} \mid \neg T) \times P(W2_{\neg T} \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Using these, we calculate the total probability of the witnesses' claims:

\[ P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T}) = P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T} \mid T) \times P(T) + P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T} \mid \neg T) \times P(\neg T) \]
\[ = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T}) = \frac{P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T} \mid T) \times P(T)}{P(W1_{T} \cap W2_{\neg T})} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
