To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define:
- \( H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witnesses' abilities are as follows:
- First witness (W1) correctly identifies height 80% of the time:
  - \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- Second witness (W2) correctly identifies height 70% of the time:
  - \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate \( P(H | \text{W1 claims tall}) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1)} \]

Firstly, we need to find \( P(W1) \):
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W1) \):
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Thus, the estimate is: {probability: 0.4138}
