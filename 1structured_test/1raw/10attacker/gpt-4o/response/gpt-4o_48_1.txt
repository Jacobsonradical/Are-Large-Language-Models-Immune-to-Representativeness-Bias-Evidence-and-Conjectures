To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witness testimonies and the given city population data, we can apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( F \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \): Probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \): Probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(F | H_1) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(F | H_2) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate:

\[ P(H_1 | E, F) \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(H_1 | E, F) = \frac{P(E, F | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E, F)} \]

First we need to find \( P(E, F) \):

\[ P(E, F) = P(E, F | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E, F | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

From independence of E and F, we have:

\[ P(E, F | H_1) = P(E | H_1) \cdot P(F | H_1) \]
\[ P(E, F | H_2) = P(E | H_2) \cdot P(F | H_2) \]

So:
\[ P(E, F | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E, F | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Thus:
\[ P(E, F) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E, F) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E, F) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E, F) = \frac{P(E, F | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E, F)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E, F) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
