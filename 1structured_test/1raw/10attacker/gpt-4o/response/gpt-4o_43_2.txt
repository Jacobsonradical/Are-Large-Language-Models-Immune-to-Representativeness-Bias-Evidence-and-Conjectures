To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information provided, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We have the following given probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1_T | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2_S | T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements of both witnesses. 

To do this, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T \cap W2_S)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \) and \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S | S) \):
\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Next, we calculate \( P(W1_T \cap W2_S) \):
\[
P(W1_T \cap W2_S) = P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T \cap W2_S | S) \cdot P(S) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T | W1_T \cap W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T \cap W2_S | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T \cap W2_S)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
