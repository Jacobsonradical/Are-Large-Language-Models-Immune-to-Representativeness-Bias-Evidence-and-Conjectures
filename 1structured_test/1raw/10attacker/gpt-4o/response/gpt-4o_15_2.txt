To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.

Let's define the events as follows:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (First witness's accuracy if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \) (First witness's error if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Second witness's error if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | B) = 0.70 \) (Second witness's accuracy if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Firstly, we use Bayes' Theorem for the first witness:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

The total probability \( P(W_1) \) is given by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Next, we update our probability with the second witness:
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 | A, W_1) \cdot P(A | W_1)}{P(W_2 | W_1)} \]

We assume conditional independence given \( A \):
\[ P(W_2 | A, W_1) = P(W_2 | A) \]
\[ P(W_2 | W_1) = P(W_2 | A) \cdot P(A | W_1) + P(W_2 | B) \cdot P(B | W_1) \]
Where \( P(B | W_1) = 1 - P(A | W_1) \):
\[ P(B | W_1) = 1 - 0.4138 = 0.5862 \]

Now calculate \( P(W_2 | W_1) \):
\[ P(W_2 | W_1) = (0.30 \cdot 0.4138) + (0.70 \cdot 0.5862) = 0.12414 + 0.41034 = 0.53448 \]

Finally:
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.30 \cdot 0.4138}{0.53448} = \frac{0.12414}{0.53448} \approx 0.2322 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements is approximately:
\[ {probability: 0.2322} \]
