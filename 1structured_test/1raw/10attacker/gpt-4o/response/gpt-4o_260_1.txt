To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step approach to calculate it:

First, let's define the events:
- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B_1 \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B_2 \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
- \( P(A) \) = Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P(A^c) \) = Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

- \( P(B_1 | A) \) = Probability that the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- \( P(B_1 | A^c) \) = Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter as 185 cm or taller = 0.20

- \( P(B_2 | A) \) = Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller as shorter = 0.30
- \( P(B_2 | A^c) \) = Probability that the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm = 0.70

We need to find:
\[ P(A | B_1, B_2) \]

Using Bayes' theorem for multiple events:
\[ P(A | B_1, B_2) = \frac{P(B_1, B_2 | A)P(A)}{P(B_1, B_2)} \]

\[ P(B_1, B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) \times P(B_2 | A) \]
\[ P(B_1, B_2 | A^c) = P(B_1 | A^c) \times P(B_2 | A^c) \]

So:
\[ P(B_1, B_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(B_1, B_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(B_1, B_2) = P(B_1, B_2 | A)P(A) + P(B_1, B_2 | A^c)P(A^c) \]

Thus:
\[ P(B_1, B_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B_1, B_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find:
\[ P(A | B_1, B_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
