To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given data and the testimony of the witnesses, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \lnot H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_H \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_{\lnot H} \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\lnot H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \)
- The first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time:
    - \( P(W1_H | H) = 0.80 \)
    - \( P(W1_H | \lnot H) = 0.20 \)
- The second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time:
    - \( P(W2_{\lnot H} | \lnot H) = 0.70 \)
    - \( P(W2_{\lnot H} | H) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(H | W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H}) \).

Using Bayesian inference and the fact that the witnesses' testimonies are independent,

1. Calculate the likelihood of both witnesses' claims given \( H \):

\[ P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H} | H) = P(W1_H | H) \times P(W2_{\lnot H} | H) \]
\[ = 0.80 \times 0.30 \]
\[ = 0.24 \]

2. Calculate the likelihood of both witnesses' claims given \( \lnot H \):

\[ P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H} | \lnot H) = P(W1_H | \lnot H) \times P(W2_{\lnot H} | \lnot H) \]
\[ = 0.20 \times 0.70 \]
\[ = 0.14 \]

3. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probability:

\[ P(H | W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H}) = \frac{P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H} | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H})} \]

Where \( P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H}) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H}) = P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H} | H) \times P(H) + P(W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H} | \lnot H) \times P(\lnot H) \]
\[ = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Now we can substitute this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W1_H \land W2_{\lnot H}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ = 0.2323 \]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.2323} \} \]
