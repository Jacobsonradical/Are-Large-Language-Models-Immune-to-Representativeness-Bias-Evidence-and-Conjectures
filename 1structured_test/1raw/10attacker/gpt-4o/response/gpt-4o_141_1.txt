To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and the population data, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H \) = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \) = Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 \) = First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg W1 \) = First witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W2 \) = Second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg W2 \) = Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\neg W1|H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\neg W1|\neg H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\neg W2|H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(\neg W2|\neg H) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(H | W1, W2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W1, W2 | H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Similarly, calculate \( P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \):
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = 0.30 \cdot 0.70 = 0.21 \]

Next, we need to find \( P(W1, W2) \):
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.21 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.1785 = 0.2145 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W1, W2) \):
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.2145} \]
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.2145} \]
\[ P(H | W1, W2) \approx 0.1678 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is: 
\[ {probability: 0.1678} \]
