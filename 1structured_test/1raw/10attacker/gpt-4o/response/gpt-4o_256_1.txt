To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (as the first witness claimed), we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the events as follows:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2|T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2|S) = 0.70 \)

We want to calculate \( P(T|W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

First, we find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T)P(T) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S)P(S) \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T)P(W_2 | T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S)P(W_2 | S) \]

So,
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Thus,
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

So,
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
