To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_a \): The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_b \): The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are asked to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements. This is \( P(H_a | W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \).

Bayes' theorem states:

\[
P(H_a | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H_a) \cdot P(H_a)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

First, let's determine the priors:
- \( P(H_a) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_b) = 0.85 \)

Next, we consider the likelihoods based on the witness accuracy:
- For the first witness:
  - \( P(W_1 | H_a) = 0.80 \) (first witness correct when attacker is tall)
  - \( P(W_1 | H_b) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrect when attacker is short)
- For the second witness:
  - \( P(W_2 | H_a) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrect when attacker is tall)
  - \( P(W_2 | H_b) = 0.70 \) (second witness correct when attacker is short)

Using the total probability theorem for the denominator, \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H_a) \cdot P(H_a) + P(W_1, W_2 | H_b) \cdot P(H_b)
\]

Where:
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H_a) = P(W_1 | H_a) \cdot P(W_2 | H_a) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H_b) = P(W_1 | H_b) \cdot P(W_2 | H_b) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Then:
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Lastly, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H_a | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[
\{ probability: 0.232 \}
\]
