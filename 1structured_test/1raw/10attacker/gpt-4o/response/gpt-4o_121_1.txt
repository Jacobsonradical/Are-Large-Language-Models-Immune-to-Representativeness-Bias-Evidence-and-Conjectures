To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. We'll apply Bayes' theorem, which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( F \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on city population)
- \( P(F) = 0.85 \) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm based on city population)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \) (first witness accuracy if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | F) = 0.20 \) (first witness error if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | F) = 0.70 \) (second witness accuracy if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \) (second witness error if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

We'll use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | F) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | F) = P(W_1 | F) \cdot P(W_2 | F) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, we can find the total probability \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | F) \cdot P(F)
\]

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \}
\]
