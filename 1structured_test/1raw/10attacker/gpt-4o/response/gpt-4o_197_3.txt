To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \(H\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg H\) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W1\) as the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(W2\) as the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\)

Witness reliabilities:
- For the first witness: \(P(W1 | H) = 0.8\) and \(P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.2\)
- For the second witness: \(P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.7\) and \(P(W2 | H) = 0.3\)

We need to find \(P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2)\).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

First, let's find \(P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H)\):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, let's find \(P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \neg H)\):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Then, we compute the total probability of observing the witnesses' claims, \(P(W1 \text{ and } W2)\), using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find the desired probability:
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
