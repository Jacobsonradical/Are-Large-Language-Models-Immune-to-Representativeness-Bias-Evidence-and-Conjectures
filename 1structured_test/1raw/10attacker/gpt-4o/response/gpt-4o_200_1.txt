To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the structured way to approach the problem:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( T \geq 185 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( T < 185 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(T \ge 185) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(T < 185) = 0.85 \)

3. **Witness Probabilities:**
   - **First Witness**:
     - \( P(W1 | T \ge 185) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(W1 | T < 185) = 0.20 \)
   - **Second Witness**:
     - \( P(W2 | T \ge 185) = 0.30 \)
     - \( P(W2 | T < 185) = 0.70 \)

4. **Combine Witnesses' Information:**
   The combined observation from both witnesses is tricky, but we can simplify this by considering the independence of the witnesses (although real-world correlations might exist, we proceed with the given data). 

Let's calculate the combined likelihood of the attacker's height:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T \ge 185) = P(W1 | T \ge 185) \cdot P(W2 | T \ge 185) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T < 185) = P(W1 | T < 185) \cdot P(W2 | T < 185) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

5. **Posterior Probability Using Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(T \ge 185 | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

The denominator can be expressed as:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]

So,
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally,
\[ P(T \ge 185 | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately:

\[ \{ "probability": 0.2323 \} \]
