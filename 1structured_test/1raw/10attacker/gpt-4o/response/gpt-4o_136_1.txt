To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

First, let's denote the following:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (since 70% correct, 30% error)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \)

We are interested in \( P(T | W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ 
P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} 
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S) 
\]

Let's compute \( P(W1) \):
\[ 
P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 
\]
\[ 
P(W1) = 0.29 
\]

Now, compute \( P(T | W1) \):
\[ 
P(T | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
\]
\[ 
P(T | W1) \approx 0.4138 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ 
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} 
\]

Rounded to two significant figures, the final answer is:

\[ 
\{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \} 
\]
