To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A \mid W_1) \) and then incorporate the information from the second witness. The application of Bayes' theorem goes as follows:

\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

Based on the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \)

So,
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now,
\[ P(A \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim is approximately 0.414.

Hence,
