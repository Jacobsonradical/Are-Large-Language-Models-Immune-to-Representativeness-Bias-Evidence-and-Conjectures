To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_H \): the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_L \): the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we know the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \)

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H | \text{evidence}) = \frac{P(\text{evidence} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{evidence})} \]

First, we calculate \( P(\text{evidence} | H) \) and \( P(\text{evidence} | L) \).

The evidence consists of two parts: witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and witness 2 claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(W1_H | H) = 0.8 \) (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W2_L | L) = 0.7 \) (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The probabilities of the witnesses making errors are:
- \( P(W1_H | L) = 0.2 \) (the first witness is wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2_L | H) = 0.3 \) (the second witness is wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

So, we calculate:
\[ P(\text{evidence} | H) = P(W1_H | H) \times P(W2_L | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Similarly:
\[ P(\text{evidence} | L) = P(W1_H | L) \times P(W2_L | L) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, we find \( P(\text{evidence}) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(\text{evidence}) = P(\text{evidence} | H) \cdot P(H) + P(\text{evidence} | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(\text{evidence}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | \text{evidence}) = \frac{P(\text{evidence} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{evidence})} \]
\[ P(H | \text{evidence}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | \text{evidence}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
