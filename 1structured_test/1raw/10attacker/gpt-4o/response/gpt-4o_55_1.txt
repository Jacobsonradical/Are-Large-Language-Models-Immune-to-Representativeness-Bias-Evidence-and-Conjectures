Let's denote the following events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_H \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W1_S \): The first witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W2_H \): The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_S \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the probability, by population proportion, that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (the probability, by population proportion, that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1_H | H) = 0.8 \) (the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1_S | S) = 0.7 \) (the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, 70% of the time)

From this, we can also infer:

- \( P(W1_H | S) = 0.2 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W1_S | H) = 0.3 \) (the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm, 30% of the time)

The goal is to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed this, i.e., \( P(H | W1_H) \).

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(H | W1_H) = \frac{P(W1_H | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1_H)} \]

Where \( P(W1_H) \) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1_H) = P(W1_H | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1_H | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1_H) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_H) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1_H) = 0.29 \]

Next, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | W1_H) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1_H) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1_H) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately \( 0.414 \).

Therefore, the estimate of the probability is:

{probability: 0.414}
