To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- \( L \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the height is 185 cm or taller
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the height is shorter than 185 cm

We need to find \( P(H \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \). Let's break it down using the given data:

1. **Prior Probabilities**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - For the first witness: 
     - \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy for 185 cm or taller)
     - \( P(W_1 \mid L) = 0.20 \) (error rate for shorter than 185 cm)
   - For the second witness:
     - \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (error rate for 185 cm or taller)
     - \( P(W_2 \mid L) = 0.70 \) (70% accuracy for shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Combined Likelihood**:
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid L) = P(W_1 \mid L) \times P(W_2 \mid L) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Total Probability of Evidence**:
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid L) \times P(L) \)
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

5. **Posterior Probability**:
   - \( P(H \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \)
   - \( P(H \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232}
