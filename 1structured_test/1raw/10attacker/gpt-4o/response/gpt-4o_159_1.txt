We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claimed that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claimed that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We start with the following probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we have the witness accuracy:
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a taller person as shorter)
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a shorter person as shorter)

We are interested in \( P(A | W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 | B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W1) \):
\[ P(A | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | W1) \approx 0.41 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.41.
