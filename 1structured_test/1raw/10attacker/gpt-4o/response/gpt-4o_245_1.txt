To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and their reliability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. 

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) \). Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg T) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg T) = P(W_1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we use the Law of Total Probability to find \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we calculate \( P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
