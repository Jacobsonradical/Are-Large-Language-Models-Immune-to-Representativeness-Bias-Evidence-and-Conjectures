To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem, which is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here:
- \(A\) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) is the event that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(B|A) = 0.80\) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(\neg A) = 0.85\) (the prior probability that any randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \(P(B|\neg A) = 0.20\) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

First, we need to calculate the total probability \(P(B)\) that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(A|B)\):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138.

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
