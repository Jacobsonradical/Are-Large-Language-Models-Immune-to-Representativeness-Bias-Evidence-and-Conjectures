To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness reports, we can utilize Bayes' theorem. 

Given information:
- First witness (W1): \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
- Second witness (W2): \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) and \( P(W2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \)
- Population distribution: \( P(T) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)

We are interested in \( P(T | W1, W2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (T) given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem in this context, we start with:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Since the witnesses' testimonies are conditionally independent given the height:
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg T) = P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(W2 | \neg T) \]

The total probability of both witnesses' observations is:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

And the posterior probability:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.2323} \} \] 

So to provide the probability in correct format:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.2323} \} \]
