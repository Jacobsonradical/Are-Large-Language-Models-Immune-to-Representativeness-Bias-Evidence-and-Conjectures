To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from the two witnesses and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_{T} \): First witness claims "185 cm or taller".
- \( W2_{T} \): Second witness claims "shorter than 185 cm".

Given:
- P(W1_T | T) = 0.8
- P(W1_T | S) = 0.2
- P(W2_T | T) = 0.3
- P(W2_T | S) = 0.7

And:
- P(T) = 0.15
- P(S) = 0.85

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(T | W1_T \cap W2_T) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the claims of the witnesses.

According to Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T | W1_T \cap W2_T) = \frac{P(W1_T \cap W2_T | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T \cap W2_T)} \]

We need to first find \( P(W1_T \cap W2_T) \):

\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T) = P(W1_T \cap W2_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T \cap W2_T | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Since the witnesses' claims are conditionally independent given the attacker's height, we get:

\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_T | T) \]
\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T | S) = P(W1_T | S) \cdot P(W2_T | S) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T | S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_T \cap W2_T) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T | W1_T \cap W2_T) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T \cap W2_T) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_T \cap W2_T) \approx 0.2323 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.
