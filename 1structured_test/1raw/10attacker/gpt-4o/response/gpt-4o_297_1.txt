To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claims this.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller based on the first witness's claim is approximately 0.414.
