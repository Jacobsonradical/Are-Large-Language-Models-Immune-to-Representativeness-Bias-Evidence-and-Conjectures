To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Specifically, we want to determine the probability that the height \( H \) is 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( H_t \)), given the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( T_1 \) is the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T_2 \) is the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem we know:
- \( P(T_1|H_t) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(T_1|H_s) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(T_2|H_t) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(T_2|H_s) = 0.7 \)

We need to find the combined probability given both testimonies, i.e., \( P(H_t | T_1 \text{ and } T_2) \).

First, we calculate \( P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_t) \) and \( P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_s) \):

\[ P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_t) = P(T_1|H_t) \cdot P(T_2|H_t) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_s) = P(T_1|H_s) \cdot P(T_2|H_s) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, using the law of total probability, we calculate \( P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2) \):

\[ P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2) = P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_t) \cdot P(H_t) + P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_s) \cdot P(H_s) \]
\[ P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H_t | T_1 \text{ and } T_2) \):

\[ P(H_t | T_1 \text{ and } T_2) = \frac{P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2|H_t) \cdot P(H_t)}{P(T_1 \text{ and } T_2)} \]
\[ P(H_t | T_1 \text{ and } T_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.23226.
