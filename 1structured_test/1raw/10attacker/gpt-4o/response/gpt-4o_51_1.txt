To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall attacker)
- \( P(W_1|B) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as tall)
- \( P(W_2|A) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall attacker as short)
- \( P(W_2|B) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a short attacker)

We are interested in the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

\[ P(A|W_1) \]

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W_1) \):

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1|B) \cdot P(B) \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W_1) \):

\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
