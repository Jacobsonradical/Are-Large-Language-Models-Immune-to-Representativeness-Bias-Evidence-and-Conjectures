To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the provided information, we can instantiate the following probabilities:

From the population data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)

From the witness accuracy data:
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.7 \)

We are interested in calculating \( P(H_1 | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(E_1) \). This is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting in the known values:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E_1) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.414 \} \]
