To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness's statement (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( E_2 \): The second witness's statement (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(H_1 | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

Bayes' theorem states:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1)} \]

We can break down \( P(E_1) \) as follows:

\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

From the given information:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies \( H_1 \)).
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.30 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies \( H_2 \) as \( H_1 \)).

Substitute these values into the equations:

\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.375 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E_1) \):

\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E_1) = 0.32 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.32 \} \]
