To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( H_t \): the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_s \): the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using the information provided, we can calculate the following probabilities:

1. Prior probabilities:
   - \( P(H_t) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(H_s) = 0.85 \)

2. Probability of witnesses being correct:
   - \( P(E_1 | H_t) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(E_1 | H_s) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(E_2 | H_t) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(E_2 | H_s) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(H_t | E_1 \land E_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies. We'll use Bayes' Theorem for this calculation.

First, we assess the evidence provided by the witnesses:

Updating for the first witness:
\[ P(H_t | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H_t) \times P(H_t)}{P(E_1)} \]

Where \( P(E_1) \) is the total probability of the evidence from the first witness:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H_t) \times P(H_t) + P(E_1 | H_s) \times P(H_s) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.29 \]

Then,
\[ P(H_t | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_t | E_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Next, using \( P(H_t | E_1) \) as the prior for incorporating the second witness's information:

Updating for the second witness:
\[ P(H_t | E_1 \land E_2) = \frac{P(E_2 | H_t) \times P(H_t | E_1)}{P(E_2 | E_1)} \]

Where \( P(E_2 | E_1) \) is the total probability of the evidence from the second witness given the first witness's evidence:
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = P(E_2 | H_t) \times P(H_t | E_1) + P(E_2 | H_s) \times P(H_s | E_1) \]

Using \( P(H_s | E_1) = 1 - P(H_t | E_1) \):
\[ P(H_s | E_1) = 1 - 0.4138 \]
\[ P(H_s | E_1) \approx 0.5862 \]

So,
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = (0.30 \times 0.4138) + (0.70 \times 0.5862) \]
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = 0.12414 + 0.41034 \]
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = 0.53448 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H_t | E_1 \land E_2) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.4138}{0.53448} \]
\[ P(H_t | E_1 \land E_2) = \frac{0.12414}{0.53448} \]
\[ P(H_t | E_1 \land E_2) \approx 0.2323 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.
