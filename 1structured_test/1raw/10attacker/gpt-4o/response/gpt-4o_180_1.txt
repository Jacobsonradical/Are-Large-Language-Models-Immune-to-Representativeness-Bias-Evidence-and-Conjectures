To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1(T) \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2(S) \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided, we have:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1(T) \| T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1(T) \| S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2(S) \| S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2(S) \| T) = 0.30 \)

We want to find \( P(T \| W_1(T) \)).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \| W_1(T)) = \frac{P(W_1(T) \| T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1(T))} \]

First, let's calculate \( P(W_1(T)) \), which is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W_1(T)) = P(W_1(T) \| T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1(T) \| S) \cdot P(S) \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(W_1(T)) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1(T)) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]
\[ P(W_1(T)) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \| W_1(T)) = \frac{(0.80) \cdot (0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \| W_1(T)) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \| W_1(T)) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
