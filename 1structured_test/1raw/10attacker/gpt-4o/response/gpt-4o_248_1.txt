To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): Attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): Attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(A|W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

First, we find the probabilities of each witness's claim given the attacker's height. From the given information:

- For the first witness:
  - \( P(W_1|A) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W_1|B) = 0.2 \)

- For the second witness:
  - \( P(W_2|A) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(W_2|B) = 0.7 \)

Also, we have the prior probabilities of the attacker's height based on the city's population:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability of \( A \):

\[ P(A|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

To find \( P(W_1, W_2) \), we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | B) P(B) \]

Now, \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | B) \) can be considered as the product of individual probabilities (assuming the witnesses' observations are independent):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) P(W_2 | A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | B) = P(W_1 | B) P(W_2 | B) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Substituting these values back into the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we find the posterior probability:

\[ P(A|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]

Thus, the probability is about 0.232 or 23.2%.
