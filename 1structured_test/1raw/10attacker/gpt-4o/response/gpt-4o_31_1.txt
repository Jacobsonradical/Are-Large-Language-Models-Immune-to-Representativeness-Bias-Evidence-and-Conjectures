To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Bayes' Theorem is defined as:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Here, we need to define the following probabilities:
- \( A \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A' \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( B_1 \): First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \): Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(A) \)): 0.15
- Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(A') \)): 0.85
- Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller (\( P(B_1|A) \)): 0.80
- Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller (\( P(B_1|A') \)): 0.20
- Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(B_2|A') \)): 0.70
- Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter (\( P(B_2|A) \)): 0.30

We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim, \( P(A|B_1) \).

By Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B_1) = \frac{P(B_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1)} \]

We first need to calculate \( P(B_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B_1) = P(B_1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1|A') \cdot P(A') \]
\[ P(B_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(B_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|B_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B_1) \approx 0.41 \]

Thus, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
