To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need \( P(H \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

To find \( P(W_1) \):

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Plugging in the known values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(H \mid W_1) \):

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
