To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( F1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( F2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(F1|T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness identifies correctly given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(F1|S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness identifies incorrectly given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(F2|T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness identifies incorrectly given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(F2|S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness identifies correctly given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|F1) = \frac{P(F1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(F1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(F1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(F1) = P(F1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(F1|S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(F1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(F1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(F1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(T|F1) \):

\[ P(T|F1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|F1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|F1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
