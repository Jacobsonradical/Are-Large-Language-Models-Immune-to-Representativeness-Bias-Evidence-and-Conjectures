To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given data, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define our terms:
- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the city population data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Now, let's define the witnesses' claims:
- Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The witnesses' accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.70 \)

We need to find the posterior probability \( P(T \mid W_1) \).

Applying Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(T \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)}
\]

We also need to calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \mid S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now we can find \( P(T \mid W_1) \):

\[
P(T \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[
{probability: 0.4138}
