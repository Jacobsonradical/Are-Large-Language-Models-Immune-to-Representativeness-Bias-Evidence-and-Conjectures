To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the relevant probabilities:

1. \( P(H) \) - the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(P) \) - the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
3. \( P(E|H) \) - the likelihood that the witnesses would testify as they did if the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
4. \( P(E|P) \) - the likelihood that the witnesses would testify as they did if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:

- The probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the population \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm in the population \( P(P) = 0.85 \).

The witnesses' reliability:

- First witness (witness1): Correctly identifies height (185 cm or taller) 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time.
- Second witness (witness2): Correctly identifies height (shorter than 185 cm) 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time.

We need to calculate:

1. \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller}, W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | H) \)
2. \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller}, W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | P) \)

From the witness reliabilities:
- \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller} | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | H) = 0.30 \)
  
- \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller} | P) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | P) = 0.70 \)

Using the independence of witnesses, we find:

- \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller}, W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1 \, \text{claims taller}, W2 \, \text{claims shorter} | P) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W1 \, \text{claims taller}, W2 \, \text{claims shorter}) \):

\[
P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | P) \cdot P(P)
\]

So:
\[
P(E) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85)
\]

\[
P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H | E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: 0.232} \}
\]
