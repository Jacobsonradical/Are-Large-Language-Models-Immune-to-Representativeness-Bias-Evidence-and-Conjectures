To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and the population distribution, we can use Bayesian inference.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(T \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid T) \):
- \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid T) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)

Next, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid S) \):
- \( P(W_1 \mid S) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid S) = P(W_1 \mid S) \cdot P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]

Where:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Thus:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(T \mid W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore:
