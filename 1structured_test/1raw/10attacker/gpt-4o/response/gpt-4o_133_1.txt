To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T' \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

According to Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim can be calculated as:

\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Let's break down the components:
- \( P(T) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. From the population data, this is 0.15.
- \( P(T') \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 0.85.
- \( P(W_1|T) \): The probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is 0.80.
- \( P(W_1|T') \): The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller. This is 0.20.

Bayes' theorem requires us to compute \( P(W_1) \) which can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1|T') \cdot P(T') \]

Substitute the values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Finally, compute \( P(T|W_1) \):

\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.41.

The final estimate is:
\[ \{probability: 0.41\} \]
