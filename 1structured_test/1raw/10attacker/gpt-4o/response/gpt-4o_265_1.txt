To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

First, we need to calculate \( P(W1 \mid H) \) and \( P(W2 \mid H) \), as well as \( P(W1 \mid \neg H) \) and \( P(W2 \mid \neg H) \):
- \( P(W1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (first witness correctly identifies a tall person 80% of the time)
- \( P(W1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) (second witness correctly identifies a short person 70% of the time)

Next, we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1, W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \cdot P(W2 \mid H) \)
- \( P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) = P(W1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W2 \mid \neg H) \)
- \( P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid H) P(H) + P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \)

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

Let's calculate:

\[ P(W1, W2 \mid H) = P(W1 \mid H) \cdot P(W2 \mid H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) = P(W1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid H) P(H) + P(W1, W2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \mid W1, W2) \):

\[
P(H \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately

\{ probability: 0.2323 \}
