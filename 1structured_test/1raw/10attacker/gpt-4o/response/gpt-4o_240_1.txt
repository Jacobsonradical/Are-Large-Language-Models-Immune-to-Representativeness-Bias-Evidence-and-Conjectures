To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rates, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote the following:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate the probability \( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \).

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.8 \) (first witness correctly identifies tall)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies tall)
- \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.3 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies tall as short)
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg T) = 0.7 \) (second witness correctly identifies short)

We need to find \( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where,
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) = P(W_1 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg T) \]

First, let's compute \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg T) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.232.
