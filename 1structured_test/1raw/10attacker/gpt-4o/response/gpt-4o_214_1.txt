To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian analysis. 

Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( \bar{H} \) represent the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Let \( W1 \) and \( W2 \) represent the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively.

We are given:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
2. \( P(\bar{H}) = 0.85 \)
3. The accuracy of the first witness:
    - \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \)
    - \( P(W1|\bar{H}) = 0.20 \)
4. The accuracy of the second witness:
    - \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \)
    - \( P(W2|\bar{H}) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we need to find \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \bar{H}) \):
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \bar{H}) = P(W1 | \bar{H}) \cdot P(W2 | \bar{H}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we find the total probability \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | \bar{H}) \cdot P(\bar{H}) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) \):
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ P(H | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
