To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's set this up with the given information.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- The prior probability \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The prior probability \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- The first witness's reliability: \( P(W_1|T) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1|\neg T) = 0.20 \).
- The second witness's reliability: \( P(W_2|T) = 0.30 \) and \( P(W_2|\neg T) = 0.70 \).

We want to find \( P(T|W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2|\neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

We assume independence between the witnesses' reports given the attacker's actual height:
\[ P(W_1, W_2|T) = P(W_1|T) \cdot P(W_2|T) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2|\neg T) = P(W_1|\neg T) \cdot P(W_2|\neg T) \]

Therefore:
\[ P(W_1, W_2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2|\neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now combining these with the priors:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T|W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{(0.24 \times 0.15)}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, according to the evidence presented, is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
