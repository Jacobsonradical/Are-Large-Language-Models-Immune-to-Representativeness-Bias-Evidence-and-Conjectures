To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Let's define:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the evidence from the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the evidence from the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We want to calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \} \]
