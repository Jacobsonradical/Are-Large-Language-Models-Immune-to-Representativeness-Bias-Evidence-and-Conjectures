To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to figure out the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and the population distribution.

Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the problem:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \) (since the second witness erred 30% of the time)
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \)

We need to compute the joint probability of both witnesses' statements:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \times P(W2 | A) \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \times P(W2 | B) \]

Then we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) \times P(B) \]

Finally, we use Bayes' Theorem to estimate \( P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) \):

\[ P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

Now, plug in the given values:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[
P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \\
= 0.036 + 0.119 \\
= 0.155
\]

Finally, apply Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \\
= \frac{0.036}{0.155} \\
= 0.232 \\
\]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
