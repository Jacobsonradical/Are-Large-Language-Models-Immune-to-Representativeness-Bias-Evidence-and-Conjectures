To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( T \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the testimony of the first witness (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( W_2 \) be the testimony of the second witness (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the problem statement, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

Now, we need to calculate \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | S) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
