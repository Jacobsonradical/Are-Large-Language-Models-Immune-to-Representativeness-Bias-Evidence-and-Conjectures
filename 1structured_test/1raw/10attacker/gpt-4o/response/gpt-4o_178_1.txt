We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the information from both witnesses. This is a problem of conditional probability, which can be solved using Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define:
- \( P(H) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|\neg H) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.70 \)

We need to find \( P(H|W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \). According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

We can find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Since \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) are conditionally independent given \( H \) or \( \neg H \):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(W_2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2|\neg H) = P(W_1|\neg H) \cdot P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):
\[ P(H|W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \text{{probability}} = 0.232 \]
