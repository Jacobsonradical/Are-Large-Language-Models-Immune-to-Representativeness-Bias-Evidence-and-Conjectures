To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's how we can set it up:

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the evidence from the first witness (who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller).
- \( W_2 \) be the evidence from the second witness (who claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm).

### Probabilities Given:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of being 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
5. \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
6. \( P(W_2 | B) = 0.70 \) (probability the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

### Intermediate Calculations

1. **Calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \):**
   Since the witnesses’ testimonies are independent:
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. **Calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \):**
   Likewise:
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) = P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(W_2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

3. **Calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \cdot P(B) \]
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
   \[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

### Final Calculation

Now apply Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, given the witnesses' statements and the prior probabilities, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
