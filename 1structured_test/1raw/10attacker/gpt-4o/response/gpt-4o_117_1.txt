To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 = T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 = \neg T \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 = T \,|\, T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 = \neg T \,|\, T) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_1 = T \,|\, \neg T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_1 = \neg T \,|\, \neg T) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) = \frac{P(W_1 = T \,|\, T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 = T)} \]

To find \( P(W_1 = T) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 = T) = P(W_1 = T \,|\, T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 = T \,|\, \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W_1 = T) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 = T) = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(W_1 = T) = 0.375 \]

Now we can find \( P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) \):
\[ P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(T \,|\, W_1 = T) \approx 0.32 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ {probability: 0.32} \]
