To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This will allow us to update our beliefs about the attacker's height given the witness testimonies.

Let's denote:

- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

1. \(\Pr(T) = 0.15\) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
2. \(\Pr(\neg T) = 0.85\) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

The reliability of the first witness (\( W1 \)) is:
- \(\Pr(W1 \mid T) = 0.80\)
- \(\Pr(W1 \mid \neg T) = 0.20\)

The reliability of the second witness (\( W2 \)) is:
- \(\Pr(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.70\)
- \(\Pr(W2 \mid T) = 0.30\)

We need to find \(\Pr(T \mid W1 \cap W2)\), given the conflicting reports from the witnesses.

### Bayes' Theorem Application

First, we will use Bayes' theorem to find \(\Pr(T \mid W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
\Pr(T \mid W1 \cap W2) = \frac{\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid T) \Pr(T)}{\Pr(W1 \cap W2)}
\]

We use the law of total probability to find \(\Pr(W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
\Pr(W1 \cap W2) = \Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid T) \Pr(T) + \Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg T) \Pr(\neg T)
\]

We need to find \(\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid T)\) and \(\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg T)\):

\[
\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid T) = \Pr(W1 \mid T) \times \Pr(W2 \mid T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid \neg T) = \Pr(W1 \mid \neg T) \times \Pr(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now we can find \(\Pr(W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
\Pr(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we can find \(\Pr(T \mid W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
\Pr(T \mid W1 \cap W2) = \frac{\Pr(W1 \cap W2 \mid T) \Pr(T)}{\Pr(W1 \cap W2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately \(0.232\).
