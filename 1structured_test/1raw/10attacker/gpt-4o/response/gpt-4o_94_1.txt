To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and the probabilities associated with their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

We denote:
- \( P(H \geq 185) \) as the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H < 185) \) as the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H < 185) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H < 185) = 0.70 \)

We need to calculate the combined probability that both witnesses' statements are true given the heights. For that, we'll use:

\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, calculate the numerator \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) = P(W_1 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H \geq 185) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H < 185) = P(W_1 \mid H < 185) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H < 185) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H < 185) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate the total \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H < 185) \cdot P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H \geq 185) \cdot P(H \geq 185)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \geq 185 \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
