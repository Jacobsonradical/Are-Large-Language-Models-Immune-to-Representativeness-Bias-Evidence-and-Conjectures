To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

By Bayes' theorem, we have:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Since \( P(W_1, W_2) \) is composed of the sum of the two possible scenarios (attacker being 185 cm or taller, and attacker being shorter), we can write:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) \]

Substitute the given probabilities:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
