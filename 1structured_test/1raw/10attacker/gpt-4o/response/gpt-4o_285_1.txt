To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which can be formulated as follows:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H | E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence from both witnesses.
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represents the evidence from the witnesses.

First, let's define the probabilities:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)

Now let's define the likelihoods for both witnesses:

For the first witness:
- \( P(W1 = 185 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identified height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 = 185 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identified height as 185 cm or taller when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

For the second witness:
- \( P(W2 < 185 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identified height as shorter than 185 cm when the person is actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 < 185 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identified height as shorter than 185 cm when the person is actually shorter than 185 cm)

To calculate \( P(E)\) (the overall evidence):
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
Where:
\[ P(E | H) = P(W1 = 185 | H) \cdot P(W2 < 185 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E | \neg H) = P(W1 = 185 | \neg H) \cdot P(W2 < 185 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

So:
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
