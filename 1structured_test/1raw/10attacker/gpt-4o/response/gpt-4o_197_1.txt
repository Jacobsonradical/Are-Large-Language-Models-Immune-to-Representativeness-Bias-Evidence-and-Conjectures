To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem in this context can be framed as:

\[ P(T | E) = \frac{P(E | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( T \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence from the witnesses.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E | T) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence under all the circumstances.

We know:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(T^c) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

For the evidence \( E \), we need to account for both witnesses.

First, let's calculate \( P(E | T) \):
- The first witness has an 80% chance of correctly identifying \( T \) and a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying \( T \).
- The second witness has a 30% chance of incorrectly identifying \( T \), meaning a 70% chance of incorrectly identifying \( T^c \).

Given \( T \) (185 cm or taller), the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" and the second witness says "shorter than 185 cm":
\[ P(E | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Now, let's calculate \( P(E | T^c) \):
- The first witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly identifying \( T^c \), meaning a 20% chance of saying "185 cm or taller".
- The second witness has a 70% chance of correctly identifying \( T^c \), meaning a 70% chance of saying "shorter than 185 cm".

Given \( T^c \) (shorter than 185 cm), the probability that the first witness says "185 cm or taller" and the second witness says "shorter than 185 cm":
\[ P(E | T^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, the total probability of the evidence \( E \):

\[ P(E) = P(E | T) \cdot P(T) + P(E | T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.155 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | E) \):

\[ P(T | E) = \frac{P(E | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(T | E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | E) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller according to the first witness:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
