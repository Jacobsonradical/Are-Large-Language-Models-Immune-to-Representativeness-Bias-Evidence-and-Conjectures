To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the statements from both witnesses.

First, we need the conditional probabilities and population data:

- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \cap W2)}
\]

To find \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2 | S) \cdot P(S)
\]

Since \(W1\) and \(W2\) are conditionally independent given \(T\) and \(S\):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W1 \cap W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, substitute and calculate \(P(W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
P(W1 \cap W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Next, we use Bayes' Theorem to find \(P(T | W1 \cap W2)\):

\[
P(T | W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \}
\]
