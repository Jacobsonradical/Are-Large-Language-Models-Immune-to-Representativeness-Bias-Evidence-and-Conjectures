To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and their reliability, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are interested in \( P(T \mid W_1, W_2) \).

From the given data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

\[ P(T \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ P(S \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid S) \cdot P(S)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where \( P(W_1, W_2) \) is the total probability of both witness statements occurring.

First, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid T) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid S) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid T) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid T) \]
\[ = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid S) = P(W_1 \mid S) \cdot P(W_2 \mid S) \]
\[ = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate the total probability of both witnesses' statements (\( P(W_1, W_2) \)):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can find \( P(T \mid W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(T \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
