To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness's claims, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(\text{H} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{H}) \cdot P(\text{H})}{P(\text{E})} \]

where:
- \( \text{H} \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \text{E} \) is the evidence, i.e., the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

### Given Data:
1. \( P(\text{T}) = 0.15 \) (Probability attacker is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(\text{S}) = 0.85 \) (Probability attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
3. Probability first witness accurate:
   - \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{T}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{T}) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{S}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{S}) = 0.30 \)
4. Probability second witness accurate:
   - \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{T}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{T}) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(\text{Correct} | \text{S}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{Incorrect} | \text{S}) = 0.20 \)

### Calculation:

1. The first witness claims: 
   - \( P(\text{E}_1 | \text{T}) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{E}_1 | \text{S}) = 0.20 \)

2. The second witness claims: 
   - \( P(\text{E}_2 | \text{S}) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{E}_2 | \text{T}) = 0.30 \)

#### Calculate P(E | T) and P(E | S):
- \( P(\text{E} | \text{T}) = P(\text{E}_1 | \text{T}) \cdot P(\text{E}_2 | \text{T}) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(\text{E} | \text{S}) = P(\text{E}_1 | \text{S}) \cdot P(\text{E}_2 | \text{S}) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

#### Calculate P(E):
\[ P(\text{E}) = P(\text{E} | \text{T}) \cdot P(\text{T}) + P(\text{E} | \text{S}) \cdot P(\text{S}) \]
\[ P(\text{E}) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(\text{E}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

#### Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(\text{T} | \text{E}) = \frac{P(\text{E} | \text{T}) \cdot P(\text{T})}{P(\text{E})} \]
\[ P(\text{T} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(\text{T} | \text{E}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(\text{T} | \text{E}) \approx 0.232 \]

### Final Estimate:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]

The estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.232.
