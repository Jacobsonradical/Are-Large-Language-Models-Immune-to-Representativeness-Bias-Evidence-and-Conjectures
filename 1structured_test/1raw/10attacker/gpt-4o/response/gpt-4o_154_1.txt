To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayesian reasoning. Let \(H\) represent the scenario where the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \(\neg H\) represent the scenario where the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- Prior probabilities based on the population distribution:
  - \(P(H) = 0.15\)
  - \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\)
- Witness 1's accuracy:
  - \(P(\text{Witness 1 says } H|H) = 0.80\)
  - \(P(\text{Witness 1 says } \neg H |H) = 0.20\)
  - \(P(\text{Witness 1 says } H| \neg H) = 0.30\)
  - \(P(\text{Witness 1 says } \neg H |\neg H) = 0.70\)

We need to find \(P(H|\text{Witness 1 says } H)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|\text{Witness 1 says } H) = \frac{P(\text{Witness 1 says } H|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{Witness 1 says } H)}
\]

First, we calculate the total probability \(P(\text{Witness 1 says } H)\):
\[
P(\text{Witness 1 says } H) = P(\text{Witness 1 says } H|H) \cdot P(H) + P(\text{Witness 1 says } H| \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
P(\text{Witness 1 says } H) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.30 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(\text{Witness 1 says } H) = 0.12 + 0.255
\]
\[
P(\text{Witness 1 says } H) = 0.375
\]

Next, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|\text{Witness 1 says } H) = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.15)}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(H|\text{Witness 1 says } H) = \frac{0.12}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(H|\text{Witness 1 says } H) = 0.32
\]

So, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{probability: 0.32\}
\]
