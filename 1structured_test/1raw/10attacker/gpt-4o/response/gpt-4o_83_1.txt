To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to estimate \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \)

We apply Bayes' theorem as follows:

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate the total probability, \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ probability: 0.232 \} \]
