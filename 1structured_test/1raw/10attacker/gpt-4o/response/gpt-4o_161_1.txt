To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and their accuracy, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Let's denote:

- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the second witness claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First, we calculate the prior probabilities from the population statistics:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we need to use the witnesses' accuracy to calculate the likelihoods:
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

We can apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given by:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:
