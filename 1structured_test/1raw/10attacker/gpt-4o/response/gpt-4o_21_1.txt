To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the city population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

First, let's define the events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:

- Prior probability of \( T \): \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability of \( S \): \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

- The accuracy of the first witness:
  - \( P(W_1 \mid T) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W_1 \mid S) = 0.2 \)

- The accuracy of the second witness:
  - \( P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.3 \)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements (\( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \)). First, let's calculate the joint probability of both witnesses making their claims using the law of total probability.

1. Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) = P(W_1 \mid T) \cdot P(W_2 \mid T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

2. Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) = P(W_1 \mid S) \cdot P(W_2 \mid S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

3. Calculate the total probability \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. Finally, calculate \( P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
