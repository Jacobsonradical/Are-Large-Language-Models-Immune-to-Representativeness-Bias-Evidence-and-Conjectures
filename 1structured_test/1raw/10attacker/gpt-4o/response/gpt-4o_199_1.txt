To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' observations and their reliability, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here we incorporate the population statistics along with the witnesses' reliability.

Let's define:
- \( T \): attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T \mid W1, W2) \).

According to Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, we calculate each term one by one.

1. **Prior probability** \( P(T) \) and \( P(S) \):
   \[ P(T) = 0.15 \]
   \[ P(S) = 0.85 \]
   
2. **Reliability of the witnesses**:

   For the first witness:
   \[ P(W1 \mid T) = 0.80 \]
   \[ P(W1 \mid S) = 0.20 \]
   
   For the second witness:
   \[ P(W2 \mid S) = 0.70 \]
   \[ P(W2 \mid T) = 0.30 \]

Now we need \( P(W1, W2 \mid T) \) and \( P(W1, W2) \).

3. **Combining the witnesses**:

   \[ P(W1, W2 \mid T) = P(W1 \mid T) \cdot P(W2 \mid T) \]
   \[ P(W1, W2 \mid S) = P(W1 \mid S) \cdot P(W2 \mid S) \]

   Substituting the known values:
   \[ P(W1, W2 \mid T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
   \[ P(W1, W2 \mid S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

4. **Calculating the marginal probability** \( P(W1, W2) \):

   We use the Law of Total Probability:
   \[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 \mid S) \cdot P(S) \]
   \[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
   \[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

5. **Finally, applying Bayes’ Theorem**:

   \[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]
   \[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
   \[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
   \[ P(T \mid W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the given information, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
