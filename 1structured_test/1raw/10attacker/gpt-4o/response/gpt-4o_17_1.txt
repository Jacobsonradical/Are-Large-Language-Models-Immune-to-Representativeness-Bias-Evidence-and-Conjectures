To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Assign probabilities:**
   - From information "a":
     - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
     - \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
   - From information "b":
     - The first witness's reliability:
       - \( P(W1 \mid T) = 0.80 \)
       - \( P(W1 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \)
     - The second witness's reliability:
       - \( P(W2 \mid T) = 0.30 \)
       - \( P(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.70 \)

3. **Calculate \( P(T \mid W1, W2) \) using Bayes' theorem:**

    Bayes' theorem states:
    \[
    P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)}
    \]
    We need to calculate \( P(W1, W2 \mid T) \):
    \[
    P(W1, W2 \mid T) = P(W1 \mid T) \cdot P(W2 \mid T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
    \]

    We calculate \( P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) \):
    \[
    P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) = P(W1 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
    \]

    Next, we calculate \( P(W1, W2) \) using the law of total probability:
    \[
    P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
    \]
    \[
    P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
    \]

4. **Finally, compute \( P(T \mid W1, W2) \):**
   \[
   P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.232.

\[{probability: 0.232}\]
