To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step calculation.

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( H' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(H') = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
   - The first witness's accuracy:
     - \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \) (80% chance first witness correctly identifies height if attacker is 185 cm or taller)
     - \( P(W_1|H') = 0.20 \) (20% chance first witness incorrectly identifies height if attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
   - The second witness's accuracy:
     - \( P(W_2|H') = 0.70 \) (70% chance second witness correctly identifies height if attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
     - \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \) (30% chance second witness incorrectly identifies height if attacker is 185 cm or taller)

3. **Calculate the joint probability:**
   - We need \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H') \).

     Since the witnesses are independent, we have:
     \[
     P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
     \]
     \[
     P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H') = P(W_1 | H') \cdot P(W_2 | H') = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
     \]

4. **Calculate the total probability for the observations \( W_1 \cap W_2 \):**
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H') \cdot P(H')
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

5. **Use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):**
   \[
   P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the accounts of both witnesses, is approximately **0.232**.

Therefore, in the required format:

\[
\{probability: 0.232\}
\]
