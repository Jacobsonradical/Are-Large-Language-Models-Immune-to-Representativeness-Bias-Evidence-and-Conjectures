To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which in this case is:

\[ P( H | E ) = \frac{ P( E | H ) \cdot P( H ) }{ P( E ) } \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses.

Given:
- \( P( H ) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- \( P( \neg H ) \): Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

For the first witness:
- \( P( E_1 | H ) \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80
- \( P( E_1 | \neg H ) \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20

For the second witness:
- \( P( E_2 | H )\): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.30
- \( P( E_2 | \neg H ) \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies the height as shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.70

We seek \( P( H | E_1 \text{ and } E_2 ) \). Using Bayes' Theorem, we need to calculate the joint probabilities.

1. Joint probability of witnesses' statements given the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(E | H) = P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) \times P(E_2 | H) \]
\[ P(E | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. Joint probability of witnesses' statements given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(E | \neg H) = P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \times P(E_2 | \neg H) \]
\[ P(E | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

3. Total probability of the evidence under all hypotheses:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. Finally, using Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | E) \):
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.2323 \} \]
