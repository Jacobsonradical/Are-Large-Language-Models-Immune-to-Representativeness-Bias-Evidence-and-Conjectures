To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \geq 185 \): The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 < 185 \): The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 \geq 185 \mid S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 < 185 \mid S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2 < 185 \mid T) = 0.30 \)

We want to find the posterior probability \( P(T \mid W1 \geq 185) \).

By Bayes' theorem,
\[
P(T \mid W1 \geq 185) = \frac{P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \geq 185)}
\]

First, we need to find \( P(W1 \geq 185) \):
\[
P(W1 \geq 185) = P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \geq 185 \mid S) \cdot P(S)
\]
\[
P(W1 \geq 185) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W1 \geq 185) = 0.12 + 0.17
\]
\[
P(W1 \geq 185) = 0.29
\]

Now use this in Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(T \mid W1 \geq 185) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T \mid W1 \geq 185) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\]
\[
P(T \mid W1 \geq 185) \approx 0.4138
\]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

In the requested format:
\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
