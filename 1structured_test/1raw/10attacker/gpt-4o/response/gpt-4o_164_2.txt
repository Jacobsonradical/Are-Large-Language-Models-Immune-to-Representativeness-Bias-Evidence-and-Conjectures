To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us update the probability estimate for a hypothesis when given new evidence. Here, we are interested in the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\(H\)) given the witness testimonies (\(E_1\) and \(E_2\)).

First, let's define the probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): the prior probability that a person is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg H)\): the prior probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E_1 | H)\): the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(E_1 | \neg H)\): the probability that the first witness erroneously identifies a person as 185 cm or taller when the person is shorter.
- \(P(E_2 | H)\): the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E_2 | \neg H)\): the probability that the second witness erroneously identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm when the person is 185 cm or taller.

From the information provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\)
- \(P(E_1 | H) = 0.8\)
- \(P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.2\)
- \(P(E_2 | H) = 0.3\) (since the second witness errs 30% of the time for taller people)
- \(P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.7\)

We need to calculate \(P(H | E_1, E_2)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

By Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

To find \(P(E_1, E_2 | H)\):

\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(E_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

To find \(P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H)\):

\[ P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The total probability \(P(E_1, E_2)\) can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H)P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]

\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \(P(H | E_1, E_2)\):

\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

{probability: 0.2323}
