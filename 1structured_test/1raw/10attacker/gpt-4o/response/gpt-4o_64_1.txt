To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events.

Let's define the following:
- \( H_L \): The event that the attacker is less than 185 cm.
- \( H_H \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_{W1} \): Evidence provided by the first witness (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( E_{W2} \): Evidence provided by the second witness (attacker is less than 185 cm).

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H_L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E_{W1} | H_H) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy for the first witness if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E_{W1} | H_L) = 0.20 \) (20% error rate for the first witness if the attacker is less than 185 cm).
- \( P(E_{W2} | H_L) = 0.70 \) (70% accuracy for the second witness if the attacker is less than 185 cm).
- \( P(E_{W2} | H_H) = 0.30 \) (30% error rate for the second witness if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We need to find \( P(H_H | E_{W1} \cap E_{W2}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. To simplify, let's first use the Bayes theorem:

\[ 
P(H_H | E_{W1}) = \frac{P(E_{W1} | H_H) \cdot P(H_H)}{P(E_{W1})}
\]

Where \( P(E_{W1}) \) is the total probability of the first witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of the actual height:

\[ 
P(E_{W1}) = P(E_{W1} | H_H) \cdot P(H_H) + P(E_{W1} | H_L) \cdot P(H_L) 
\]

Substituting the numbers:

\[ 
P(E_{W1}) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 
\]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ 
P(H_H | E_{W1}) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony is approximately 0.414. 

So, the estimated probability is:

{probability: 0.414}
