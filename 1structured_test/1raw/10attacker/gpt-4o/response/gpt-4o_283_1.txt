To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will apply Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \(H_1\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(E_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \(P(H_1) = 0.15\) (prior probability that someone is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H_2) = 0.85\) (prior probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80\) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20\) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30\) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70\) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm)

We want \(P(H_1 | E_1 \text{ and } E_2)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2)} \]

First, we calculate \(P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_1)\):
\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Similarly, calculate \(P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_2)\):
\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \(P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2)\):
\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, substitute the values back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \text{ and } E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
