To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( ¬T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \): Probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(¬T) = 0.85 \): Probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|¬T) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|¬T) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(T|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

We need to calculate \( P(W1, W2|T) \), \( P(W1, W2|¬T) \), and \( P(W1, W2) \).

1. \( P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(W2|T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
2. \( P(W1, W2|¬T) = P(W1|¬T) \cdot P(W2|¬T) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, \( P(W1, W2) \) is a total probability:

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2|¬T) \cdot P(¬T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can find \( P(T|W1, W2) \):

\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T|W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
