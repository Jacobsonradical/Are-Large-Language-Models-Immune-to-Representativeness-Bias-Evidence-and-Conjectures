To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies and other provided information, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Given:
- Prior probability of being 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- Reliability of the first witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller correctly, \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- Reliability of the first witness identifying someone as shorter incorrectly, \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- Reliability of the second witness identifying someone as shorter correctly, \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)
- Reliability of the second witness identifying someone as 185 cm or taller incorrectly, \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)

We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so, \( P(T|W1) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185 cm or taller.
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

First, calculate \( P(W1) \):
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the probability is:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.414} \} \]
