To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given the following probabilities:
1. \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
4. \( P(W_1 | B) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone's height as 185 cm or taller)
5. \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone of height 185 cm or taller as shorter)
6. \( P(W_2 | B) = 0.70 \) (The probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \).

First, letâ€™s compute \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) = P(W_1 | B) \cdot P(W_2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we compute the joint probability of W_1 and W_2 for both scenarios:

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \cdot P(B) \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119  \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
