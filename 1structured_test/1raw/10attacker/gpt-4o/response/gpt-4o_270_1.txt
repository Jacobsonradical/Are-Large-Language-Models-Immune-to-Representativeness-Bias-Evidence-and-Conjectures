To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following:

- \( A \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so and the second witness claims otherwise.

Using Bayes' theorem, we need to calculate:

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Using the law of total probability, calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can find \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[ P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
