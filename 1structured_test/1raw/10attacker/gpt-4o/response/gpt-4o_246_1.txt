To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \(H_1\) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H_2\) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \(P(H_1) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \(P(H_2) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \(P(\text{First witness says taller}|H_1) = 0.80\)
   - \(P(\text{First witness says taller}|H_2) = 0.20\)
   - \(P(\text{Second witness says shorter}|H_1) = 0.30\)
   - \(P(\text{Second witness says shorter}|H_2) = 0.70\)

3. **Combined likelihood of both witnesses**:
   - \(P(\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}|H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24\)
   - \(P(\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}|H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14\)

4. **Posterior probability using Bayes' theorem**:
   - \(P(H_1|\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}) = \frac{P(\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}|H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}|H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}|H_2) \times P(H_2)}\)

Substitute the values:
\[P(H_1|\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{(0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85)}\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[0.24 \times 0.15 = 0.036\]

Calculate the denominator:
\[0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\]

Therefore, the posterior probability is:
\[P(H_1|\text{First says taller and Second says shorter}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2322\]

So, the estimate of the probability is:
