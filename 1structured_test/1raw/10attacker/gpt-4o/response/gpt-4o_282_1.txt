To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness stating the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

We are looking for \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

We need to compute \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) \) and the total probability \( P(W_1, W_2) \).

The joint probabilities are:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Thus, the numerator \( P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) \) is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 = 0.036 \]

The total probability \( P(W_1, W_2) \) is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1, W_2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, the probability \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \) is:
\[ P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = \frac{36}{155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.232}
