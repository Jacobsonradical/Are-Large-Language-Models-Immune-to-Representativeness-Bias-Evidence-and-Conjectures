To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll denote:

- \(A\): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(A'\): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
1. \(P(A) = 0.15\)
2. \(P(A') = 0.85\)
3. \(P(W_1 | A) = 0.80\)
4. \(P(W_1 | A') = 0.20\)
5. \(P(W_2 | A) = 0.30\)
6. \(P(W_2 | A') = 0.70\)

We want to find \(P(A | W_1)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)}\]

We first need to find \(P(W_1)\):

\[P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 | A') \cdot P(A')\]

Substituting the known values:

\[P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)\]
\[P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(W_1) = 0.29\]

Now we can calculate \(P(A | W_1)\):

\[P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(A | W_1) \approx 0.4138\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
