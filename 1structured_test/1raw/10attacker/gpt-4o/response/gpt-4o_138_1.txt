To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here is a step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( S \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
  
2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \): Probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \): Probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness mistakes an attacker shorter than 185 cm to be 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness mistakes an attacker 185 cm or taller to be shorter.

3. **Calculate the combined likelihoods:**
   - \( P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short | } T) = P(W1|T) \times P(W2|T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short | } S) = P(W1|S) \times P(W2|S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(T | W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short}) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short | } T) \times P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short})}
   \]

5. **Calculate the denominator (total probability of the witnesses' reports):**
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short}) = P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short | } T) \times P(T) + P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short | } S) \times P(S)
   \]
   \[
   P(W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short}) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

6. **Final calculation:**
   \[
   P(T | W1 \text{ says tall}, W2 \text{ says short}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
