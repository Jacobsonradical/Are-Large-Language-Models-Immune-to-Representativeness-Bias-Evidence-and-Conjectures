To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and accuracies, we can use Bayesian reasoning.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter.

The probability we are interested in is \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2) \).

We will use Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability.

First, calculate the prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

Next, calculate the likelihoods for each witness:
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with an 80% accuracy, so:
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (error rate)

- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter with a 70% accuracy, so:
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (error rate)
  - \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \)

We need to calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, let's calculate the total probability \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.2323} \} \]
