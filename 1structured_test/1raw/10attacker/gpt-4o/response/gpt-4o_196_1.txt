To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, we can apply Bayes' theorem.

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( S \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W1_H \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W2_S \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_H | H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1_H | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2_S | H) = 0.30 \)

We need to find \( P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

By Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_H \cap W2_S | H) P(H)}{P(W1_H \cap W2_S)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1_H \cap W2_S | H) \) and \( P(W1_H \cap W2_S | S) \):

\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S | H) = P(W1_H | H) \cdot P(W2_S | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S | S) = P(W1_H | S) \cdot P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate the total probability \( P(W1_H \cap W2_S) \):

\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S) = P(W1_H \cap W2_S | H) P(H) + P(W1_H \cap W2_S | S) P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1_H \cap W2_S) = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) \):

\[ P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W1_H \cap W2_S) \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.23.

Here is the final answer in the requested format:
