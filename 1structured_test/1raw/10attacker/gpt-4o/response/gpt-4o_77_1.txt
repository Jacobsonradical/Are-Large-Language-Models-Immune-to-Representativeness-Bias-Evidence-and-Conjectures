To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
1. The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller with a probability of 0.8 and erred in 20% of the cases.
2. The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with a probability of 0.7 and erred in 30% of the cases.
3. 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( T \geq 185 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T < 185 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \geq 185 \): The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 < 185 \): The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W1 \geq 185, W2 < 185) \propto P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T \geq 185) \times P(W2 < 185 \mid T \geq 185) \times P(T \geq 185) \]

And similarly for \( T < 185 \):
\[ P(T < 185 \mid W1 \geq 185, W2 < 185) \propto P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T < 185) \times P(W2 < 185 \mid T < 185) \times P(T < 185) \]

We need to calculate the proportions:

1. For \( T \geq 185 \):

\[ P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T \geq 185) = 0.8 \]
\[ P(W2 < 185 \mid T \geq 185) = 0.3 \]
\[ P(T \geq 185) = 0.15 \]

So, the numerator for \( P(T \geq 185 \mid W1 \geq 185, W2 < 185) \) is:

\[ P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T \geq 185) \times P(W2 < 185 \mid T \geq 185) \times P(T \geq 185) = 0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15 = 0.036 \]

2. For \( T < 185 \):

\[ P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T < 185) = 0.2 \]
\[ P(W2 < 185 \mid T < 185) = 0.7 \]
\[ P(T < 185) = 0.85 \]

So, the numerator for \( P(T < 185 \mid W1 \geq 185, W2 < 185) \) is:

\[ P(W1 \geq 185 \mid T < 185) \times P(W2 < 185 \mid T < 185) \times P(T < 185) = 0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.119 \]

Now, we calculate the probability:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W1 \geq 185, W2 < 185) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = \frac{36}{155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the probability estimate that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \boxed{0.232} \]

Thus, your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.232}
