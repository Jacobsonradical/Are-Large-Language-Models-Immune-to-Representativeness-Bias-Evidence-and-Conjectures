To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Define the Events:**
   - \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(S\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \(W1\): Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \(W2\): Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given Probabilities:**
   - \(P(T) = 0.15\)
   - \(P(S) = 0.85\)
   - \(P(W1 | T) = 0.80\)
   - \(P(W1 | S) = 0.20\) (since Witness 1 makes an error 20% of the time)
   - \(P(W2 | T) = 0.30\) (since Witness 2 makes an error 30% of the time)
   - \(P(W2 | S) = 0.70\)

3. **Probability of Witnesses' Claims Given Population Distribution:**
   - Using the law of total probability:
     - \(P(W1) = P(W1 \cap T) + P(W1 \cap S) = P(W1 | T)P(T) + P(W1 | S)P(S) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
     - \(P(W2) = P(W2 \cap T) + P(W2 \cap S) = P(W2 | T)P(T) + P(W2 | S)P(S) = (0.30)(0.15) + (0.70)(0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \)

4. **Posterior Probability Calculation:**
   - We are interested in \(P(T | W1)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim.
   - By Bayes' theorem:
     \[
     P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
