To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here's how we can perform the necessary calculations:

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information, we have the following probabilities:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

For the first witness:
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

For the second witness:
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \) (probability that the witness incorrectly identifies a person 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability that the witness correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm).

We want to find \( P(H|W1 \cap W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We'll use Bayes' theorem for this:

\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]

First, we need to compute \( P(W1 \cap W2|H) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2|H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(W2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we need to compute \( P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H) = P(W1|\neg H) \cdot P(W2|\neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now we can find the total probability \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W1 \cap W2) \):

\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232 \} \]
