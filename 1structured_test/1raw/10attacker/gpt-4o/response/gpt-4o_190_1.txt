To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies and the population data, I will apply Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(T | W1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given \( W1 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 | T) \) = the probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall attacker as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
- \( P(T) \) = the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- \( P(W1) \) = the total probability of \( W1 \)

To find \( P(W1) \), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

Where:
- \( P(W1 | S) \) = the probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short attacker as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2
- \( P(S) \) = the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85

Now calculate \( P(W1) \):
\[ P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(T | W1) \):
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T | W1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.414} \]
