To evaluate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( H_0 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

First, let's define the probabilities given in the problem:

- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_0) = 0.85 \): Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_1 | H_0) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given they are shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given they are 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_2 | H_0) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given they are shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the joint probability for each hypothesis and then normalize them.

Calculate the joint probability \( P(H_1, W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H_1, W_1, W_2) = P(W_1 | H_1) * P(W_2 | H_1) * P(H_1) \]
\[ P(H_1, W_1, W_2) = 0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 \]
\[ P(H_1, W_1, W_2) = 0.036 \]

Calculate the joint probability \( P(H_0, W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H_0, W_1, W_2) = P(W_1 | H_0) * P(W_2 | H_0) * P(H_0) \]
\[ P(H_0, W_1, W_2) = 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85 \]
\[ P(H_0, W_1, W_2) = 0.119 \]

Now, we normalize these to find the conditional probability \( P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(H_1, W_1, W_2)}{P(H_1, W_1, W_2) + P(H_0, W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
