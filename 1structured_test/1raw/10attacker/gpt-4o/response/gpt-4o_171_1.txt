To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:

- \(T_{\ge 185}\): The attacker is \( \ge 185 \) cm.
- \(T_{< 185}\): The attacker is \( < 185 \) cm.
- \(W_1\): The first witness claims the attacker is \( \ge 185 \) cm.
- \(W_2\): The second witness claims the attacker is \( < 185 \) cm.

From the given data, we have:

- \(P(T_{\ge 185}) = 0.15\)
- \(P(T_{< 185}) = 0.85\)
- \(P(W_1 \mid T_{\ge 185}) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W_1 \mid T_{< 185}) = 0.20\)
- \(P(W_2 \mid T_{\ge 185}) = 0.30\)
- \(P(W_2 \mid T_{< 185}) = 0.70\)

We need to estimate \(P(T_{\ge 185} \mid W_1)\), the probability that the attacker was \( \ge 185 \) cm given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T_{\ge 185} \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid T_{\ge 185}) \cdot P(T_{\ge 185})}{P(W_1)} \]

First, we need to calculate \(P(W_1)\), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is \( \ge 185 \) cm. This can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid T_{\ge 185}) \cdot P(T_{\ge 185}) + P(W_1 \mid T_{< 185}) \cdot P(T_{< 185}) \]

Substituting the known probabilities:
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T_{\ge 185} \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{\ge 185} \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T_{\ge 185} \mid W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as estimated by combining the given information, is approximately:
