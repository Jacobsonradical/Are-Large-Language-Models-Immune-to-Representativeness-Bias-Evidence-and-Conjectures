This problem can be solved using Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( T \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We aim to find \( P(T | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim:

\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

Given:
- The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time: \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- The first witness incorrectly identifies height 20% of the time: \( P(W_1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \)
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller: \( P(T) = 0.15 \)

To find \( P(W_1) \), the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]

\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(T | W_1) \):

\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]

\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \} \]
