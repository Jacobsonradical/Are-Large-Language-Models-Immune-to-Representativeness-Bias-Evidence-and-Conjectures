To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_T \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness accuracies (given a sample of people, half shorter than 185 cm and half 185 cm or taller):
- First witness: \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W1_T | \neg T) = 0.2 \)
- Second witness: \( P(W2_T | T) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W2_T | \neg T) = 0.7 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W1_T, W2_T) \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T | W1_T, W2_T) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_T | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_T)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(W1_T, W2_T) \) using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W1_T, W2_T) = P(W1_T, W2_T | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_T | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

Calculate the joint probabilities:
- \( P(W1_T, W2_T | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(W2_T | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1_T, W2_T | \neg T) = P(W1_T | \neg T) \cdot P(W2_T | \neg T) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now, we can find \( P(W1_T, W2_T) \):

\[
P(W1_T, W2_T) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T | W1_T, W2_T) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
