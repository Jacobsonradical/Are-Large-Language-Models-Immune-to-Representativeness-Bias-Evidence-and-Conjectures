To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Here is the information we have:
1. The prior probability that any randomly selected person from the city is 185 cm or taller is 15% (0.15).
2. The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 85% (0.85).

For the first witness:
- The probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller is 80% (0.80).
- The probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (i.e., the person is actually shorter than 185 cm) is 20% (0.20).

For the second witness:
- The probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm is 70% (0.70).
- The probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm (i.e., the person is actually 185 cm or taller) is 30% (0.30).

We will use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A | B) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.
- \( P(B | A) \) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.80).
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (0.15).
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | A') \cdot P(A') \]

Where:
- \( P(B | A') \) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.20).
- \( P(A') \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (0.85).

Let's compute \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can apply Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A | B) \approx 0.414 \]

So the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
