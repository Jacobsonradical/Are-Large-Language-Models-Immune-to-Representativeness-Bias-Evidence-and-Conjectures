To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events to help:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are looking for \( P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) \). To find this, we'll need to calculate several probabilities using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability.

1. **Prior probabilities** (given by the city's population):
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods** (accuracy of the witnesses):
   - \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \)

3. **We need to find:** \( P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) \).

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1 \text{ and } W2)} \]

**To find \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \)**:
Using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

**Calculating \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) \)**:
Since witness reports are conditionally independent given the attacker's height:
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

**Substituting back:**
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

**Now find \( P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) \)**:
\[ P(T | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\{probability: 0.232\}
