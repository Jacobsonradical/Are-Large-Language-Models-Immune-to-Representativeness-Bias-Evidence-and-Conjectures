To solve this problem, we'll need to employ Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events and provides a way to update the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. 

Given:

- Witness 1 claims the height is 185 cm or taller, with an 80% accuracy for heights 185 cm or taller and a 20% error rate.
- Witness 2 claims the height is shorter than 185 cm, with a 70% accuracy for heights shorter than 185 cm and a 30% error rate.
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

We want to find the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T | W1) \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(T | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)}
\]

First, calculate \( P(W1) \):
\[
P(W1) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1 | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T)
\]

From the given data:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.8 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies a tall attacker)
- \( P(W1 | \neg T) = 0.3 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a shorter attacker as tall)
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm)

Then,
\[
P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.3 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375
\]

Now, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(T | W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.375}
\]
\[
P(T | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \approx 0.32
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[
\{probability: 0.32\}
\]
