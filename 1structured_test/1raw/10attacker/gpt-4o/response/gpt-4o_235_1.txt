To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (denoted as \(H\)) given the witnesses' testimonies, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote the following:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
   \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
2. First witness accuracy: \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
3. Second witness accuracy: \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \), \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \).

Using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

We need to find \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \), \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \), and \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \(P(W_1, W_2)\):
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

The estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
