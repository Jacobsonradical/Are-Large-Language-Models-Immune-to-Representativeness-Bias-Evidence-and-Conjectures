To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|B) = 0.20 \)

The second witness's accuracy:
- \( P(W_2|A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2|B) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, we want to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements. We first calculate the joint probability of the witnesses' claims:

\[ P(W_1 \land W_2|A) = P(W_1|A) \cdot P(W_2|A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \land W_2|B) = P(W_1|B) \cdot P(W_2|B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A|W_1 \land W_2) \):

\[ P(A|W_1 \land W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \land W_2|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \land W_2)} \]

We need to find the total probability of the witnesses' claims:

\[ P(W_1 \land W_2) = P(W_1 \land W_2|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \land W_2|B) \cdot P(B) \]
\[ P(W_1 \land W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \land W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \land W_2) = 0.155 \]

Now we can calculate \( P(A|W_1 \land W_2) \):

\[ P(A|W_1 \land W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|W_1 \land W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|W_1 \land W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
