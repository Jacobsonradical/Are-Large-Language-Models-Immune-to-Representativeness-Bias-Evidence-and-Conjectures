To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from both witnesses and the general population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events as follows:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(A \mid W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

Given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg A) = 0.70 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) = P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(W_2 \mid A) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg A) = P(W_1 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg A) \]

And:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg A) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) = P(W_1 \mid A) \cdot P(W_2 \mid A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg A) = P(W_1 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 \mid \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A \mid W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(A \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately \( 0.232 \).
