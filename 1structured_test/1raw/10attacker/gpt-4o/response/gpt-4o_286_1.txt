To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the step-by-step process:

Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:

1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller).
2. The accuracy of the first witness ( \( W_1 \) ): \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \) (since the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time and errs 20%).
3. The accuracy of the second witness ( \( W_2 \) ): \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) and \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.70 \) (since the second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time and errs 30%).

We need to calculate the probability \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | L) \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | L) = P(W_1 | L) \cdot P(W_2 | L) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | L) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.232.
