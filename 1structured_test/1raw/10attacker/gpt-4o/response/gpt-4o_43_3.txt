To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the formula for Bayes' theorem in the context of our problem:

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the terms:

1. \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. According to the information, this is 15% or 0.15.
2. \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is 85% or 0.85.
3. \( P(B | A) \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.
4. \( P(B | \neg A) \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This is the error rate for the first witness when the attacker is shorter, which is 20% or 0.2.

We need to calculate \( P(B) \), which is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:

\[
P(B) = P(B | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
\]

Plugging in the values, we get:

\[
P(B) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, we can use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):

\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414
\]

Therefore, our estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is roughly 0.414.
