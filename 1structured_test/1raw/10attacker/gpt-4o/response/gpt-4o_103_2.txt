To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

First, let's define the following events:
- \(T\): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(S\): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W1_T\): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W2_S\): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \(P(T) = 0.15\)
- \(P(S) = 0.85\)
- \(P(W1_T | T) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W1_T | S) = 0.20\)
- \(P(W2_S | S) = 0.70\)
- \(P(W2_S | T) = 0.30\)

We want to find \(P(T | W1_T, W2_S)\), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

First, we calculate the joint probability of the witness statements for each case:

1. For the attacker being 185 cm or taller:
\[ 
P(W1_T, W2_S | T) = P(W1_T | T) \times P(W2_S | T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 
\]

2. For the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:
\[ 
P(W1_T, W2_S | S) = P(W1_T | S) \times P(W2_S | S) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 
\]

Now, we use the law of total probability to calculate the marginal likelihood \(P(W1_T, W2_S)\):

\[ 
P(W1_T, W2_S) = P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \times P(T) + P(W1_T, W2_S | S) \times P(S) 
\]

\[ 
P(W1_T, W2_S) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[ 
P(W1_T, W2_S) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 
\]

Finally, we apply Bayes' theorem to find \(P(T | W1_T, W2_S)\):

\[ 
P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{P(W1_T, W2_S | T) \times P(T)}{P(W1_T, W2_S)} 
\]

\[ 
P(T | W1_T, W2_S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.232}
