To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's the information we have:

1. Probability of a random person being 185 cm or taller (\(P(T)\)) = 0.15
2. Probability of a random person being shorter than 185 cm (\(P(S)\)) = 0.85
3. Probability that the first witness correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (\(P(W1|T)\)) = 0.80
4. Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm (\(P(W1|S)\)) = 0.20
5. Probability that the second witness correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm (\(P(W2|S)\)) = 0.70
6. Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller (\(P(W2|T)\)) = 0.30

To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (\(P(T|W1)\)), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness's claim and it can be found using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Let's calculate \( P(W1) \):

\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]

\[ P(W1) = (0.12) + (0.17) \]

\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can find \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]

\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.

So, the answer is:

{probability: 0.414}
