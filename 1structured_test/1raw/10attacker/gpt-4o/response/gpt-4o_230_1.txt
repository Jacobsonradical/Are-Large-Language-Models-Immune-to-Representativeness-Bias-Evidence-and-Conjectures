To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | A) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 | B) = 0.70 \)

First, we need to find the joint probability for both witnesses. Specifically, we need \( P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \) and \( P(W1 \cap W2 | B) \)

Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are independent, we have:
- \( P(W1 \cap W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(W2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1 \cap W2 | B) = P(W1 | B) \cdot P(W2 | B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

We use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W1, W2) \):

\[
P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 \cap W2 | B) \cdot P(B)}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
P(A | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119}
\]

\[
= \frac{0.036}{0.155}
\]

\[
\approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
