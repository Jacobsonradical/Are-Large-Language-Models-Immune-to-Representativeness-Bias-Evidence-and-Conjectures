To estimate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Given:
- P(T) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
- P(S) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
- P(W1|T) = Probability that the first witness correctly identifies (attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- P(W1|S) = Probability that the first witness errs (attacker is shorter than 185 cm but claims 185 cm or taller) = 0.20

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:

\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(T|W1) \):

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

So the answer is:

{probability: 0.4138}
