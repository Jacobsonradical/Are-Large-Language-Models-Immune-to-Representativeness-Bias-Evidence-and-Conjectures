To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \): Prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \): Prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm.

For the first witness:
- \( P(W1 | H1) = 0.80 \): Probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1 | H2) = 0.20 \): Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.

For the second witness:
- \( P(W2 | H2) = 0.70 \): Probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2 | H1) = 0.30 \): Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find \( P(H1 | W1 \text{ and } W2) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H1 | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H1) \cdot P(H1)}{ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) } \]

Where \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2) \) can be expanded using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H1) \cdot P(H1) + P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H2) \cdot P(H2) \]

We can calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H1) \) and \( P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H2) \) since the witnesses' testimonies are independent.

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H1) = P(W1 | H1) \cdot P(W2 | H1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2 | H2) = P(W1 | H2) \cdot P(W2 | H2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, substitute these into the expanded law of total probability:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H1 | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H1 | W1 \text{ and } W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness testimonies, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability} : 0.232 \} \]
