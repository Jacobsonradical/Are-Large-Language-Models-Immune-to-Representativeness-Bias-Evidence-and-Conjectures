To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define the events:**
   - \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Translate the given probabilities:**
   - Prior probabilities: 
     - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
     - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
   - Likelihoods:
     - \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \)
     - \( P(W_1 | S) = 0.20 \)
     - \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \)
     - \( P(W_2 | S) = 0.70 \)

3. **Calculate the combined likelihoods of the evidence:**
   The combined likelihood given both witnesses' testimonies is:
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \cdot P(W_2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) = P(W_1 | S) \cdot P(W_2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Calculate the total probability of the evidence (testimonies):**
   Using the law of total probability:
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | S) \cdot P(S)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

5. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   P(T | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
