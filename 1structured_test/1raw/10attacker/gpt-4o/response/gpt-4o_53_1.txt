To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

- The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time.
- The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time.
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(A|W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|A) P(A)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

We can break this down further:

\[ P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) \cdot P(W2|A) \]

\[ P(W1, W2|B) = P(W1|B) \cdot P(W2|B) \]

So,

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) P(A) + P(W1, W2|B) P(B) \]

Given the probabilities:
- \( P(W1|A) = 0.80 \) (first witness says 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2|A) = 0.30 \) (second witness says shorter given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|B) = 0.20 \) (first witness says 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter)
- \( P(W2|B) = 0.70 \) (second witness says shorter given the attacker is shorter)
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter)

Substitute these values in:

\[ P(W1, W2|A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2|B) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate \( P(A|W1, W2) \):

\[ P(A|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[ \{probability: 0.232\} \]
