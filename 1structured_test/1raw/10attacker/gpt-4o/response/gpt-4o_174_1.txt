To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E \): The evidence from the two witnesses.

Given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- The first witness has an 80% accuracy for \( H_1 \) and a 20% error rate for \( H_2 \).
- The second witness has a 70% accuracy for \( H_2 \) and a 30% error rate for \( H_1 \).

We need to calculate \( P(H_1 | E) \).

First, let's consider the combined effect of both witnesses. We can denote:

- \( W_1 \) = The first witness says the attacker is \( \geq 185 \) cm.
- \( W_2 \) = The second witness says the attacker is \( < 185 \) cm.

The likelihoods for the evidence are:
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \) and \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{P(E | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E | H_2) P(H_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E | H_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(W_2 | H_1) \]
\[ P(E | H_2) = P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(W_2 | H_2) \]

Now, plug in the values:
\[ P(E | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{(0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H_1 | E) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
