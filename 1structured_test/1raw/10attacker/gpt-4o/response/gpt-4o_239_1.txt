To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to determine \( P(H_1 | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Given information:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

First, we calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1)P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2)P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1)P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, my estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \} \]
