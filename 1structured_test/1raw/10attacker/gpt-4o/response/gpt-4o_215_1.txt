To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A' \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A') = 0.85 \) (probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | A') = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness erroneously identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | A)  = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness erroneously identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm) 
- \( P(W_2 | A') = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm)

The combined probability of both witnesses' claims given the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

The combined probability of both witnesses' claims given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A') = P(W_1 | A') \times P(W_2 | A') = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we can apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A') \cdot P(A')} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85} \]

Calculate the numerator:
\[ 0.24 \cdot 0.15 = 0.036 \]

Calculate the denominator:
\[ 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

{probability: 0.2323}
