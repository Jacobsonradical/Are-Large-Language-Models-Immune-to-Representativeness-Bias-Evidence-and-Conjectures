To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the statements from the two witnesses and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have the following probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(T | W1, W2) \).

First, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(W1, W2 | T) \) and \( P(W1, W2 | S) \).

\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) \]

\[ P(W1, W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, use the law of total probability to find \( P(W1, W2) \):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]

\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T | W1, W2) \):

\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.232 \} \]
