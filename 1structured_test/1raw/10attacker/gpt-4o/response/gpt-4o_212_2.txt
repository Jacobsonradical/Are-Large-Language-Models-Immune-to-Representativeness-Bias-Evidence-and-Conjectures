To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( S \) as the event "the attacker is shorter than 185 cm."
- \( W1_{T} \) as the event "the first witness says the attacker is taller."
- \( W2_{S} \) as the event "the second witness says the attacker is shorter."

Given data:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.80 \), \( P(W1_S | T) = 0.20 \) (first witness accuracy and error rates)
- \( P(W2_S | S) = 0.70 \), \( P(W2_T | S) = 0.30 \) (second witness accuracy and error rates)

Since the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter, it contradicts the first witness's claim. Therefore, we need to consider both pieces of evidence, and then aggregate them.

Using Bayes' theorem, we compute:

1. Probability that both witnesses are correct, given that the attacker is taller (185 cm or more):

\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | T) = P(W1_{T} | T) \cdot P(W2_{S} | T) \]
Since \( W2_{S} | T \) is essentially the error rate for the second witness:
\[ P(W2_{S} | T) = 0.30 \]
\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. Probability that the scenario is as the witnesses claim but the attacker is shorter:

\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | S) = P(W1_{T} | S) \cdot P(W2_{S} | S) \]
Using the error rate for the first witness:
\[ P(W1_{T} | S) = 0.20 \]
\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to revise our belief about the height:
\[ P(T | W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) = \frac{P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | T) \cdot P(T)}{ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) } \]
Where \( P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) \) is a normalization factor:
\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) = P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S} | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) = (0.24 \cdot 0.15) + (0.14 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we plug back in:
\[ P(T | W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1_{T} \text{ and } W2_{S}) \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.232.
