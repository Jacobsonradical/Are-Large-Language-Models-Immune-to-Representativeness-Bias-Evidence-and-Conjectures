To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following probabilities:

- \( P(H) \): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W1|H) \): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1|S) \): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W2|H) \): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W2|S) \): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time).
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time).
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

We are interested in \( P(H|W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter.

Using Bayes' theorem, we get:

\[ P(H|W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2)} \]

Where:

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(\neg W2|H) \]
\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Now, calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(\neg W2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.70 = 0.56 \]

Calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|S) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|S) = P(W1|S) \cdot P(\neg W2|S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now calculate \( P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \):

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2|S) \cdot P(S) \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = 0.56 \cdot 0.15 + 0.06 \cdot 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H|W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) \):

\[ P(H|W1 \text{ and } \neg W2) = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.6222 \]
