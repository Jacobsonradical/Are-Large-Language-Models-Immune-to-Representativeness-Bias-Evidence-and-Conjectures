To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following events:

- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

We break this down as follows:

1. **Prior Probability \( P(T) \) and \( P(S) \)**:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies height when 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W1|S) = 0.30 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies height when shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Total Probability \( P(W1) \)** can be computed using the law of total probability:
   
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.30 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.255 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.375 \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:

\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.375} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.375} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = 0.32 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.32 \} \]
