To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the two witnesses' statements and their accuracy rates, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( T \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) as the evidence from the first witness (attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( W2 \) as the evidence from the second witness (attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

We are interested in \( P(T | W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1, W2 | T) \) is the likelihood of both witnesses' statements given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W1, W2) \) is the total probability of the witnesses' statements.

First, we determine the prior probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)

Next, calculate the likelihoods:
- \( P(W1 | T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- Therefore, \( P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) \cdot P(W2 | T) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)

And for the attacker being shorter than 185 cm:
- \( P(W1 | S) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | S) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
- Therefore, \( P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) \cdot P(W2 | S) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, we calculate the total probability of the witnesses' statements:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 | S) \cdot P(S) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T | W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ \{ "probability": 0.232 \} \]
