To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which incorporates prior probabilities and likelihoods according to the witnesses' accuracy and the population statistics.

Given:
- The prior probability \( P(T \ge 185) \) is 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The prior probability \( P(T < 185) \) is 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

For the first witness:
- Probability of them saying 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(W1 \mid T \ge 185) = 0.8 \).
- Probability of them saying 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( P(W1 \mid T < 185) = 0.2 \).

For the second witness:
- Probability of them saying shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is 185 cm or taller \( P(W2 \mid T \ge 185) = 0.3 \).
- Probability of them saying shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm \( P(W2 \mid T < 185) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

We need to calculate:
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid T \ge 185) = P(W1 \mid T \ge 185) \cdot P(W2 \mid T \ge 185) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid T < 185) = P(W1 \mid T < 185) \cdot P(W2 \mid T < 185) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The total probability \( P(W1, W2) \) is:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid T \ge 185) \cdot P(T \ge 185) + P(W1, W2 \mid T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(T \ge 185 \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]
