To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence.

Let's define the following:
- \( H_1 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H_1) \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- \( P(H_2) \) (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Witness accuracy:
- First witness:
  - \( P(E_1|H_1) \) (Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
  - \( P(E_1|H_2) \) (Probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2
- Second witness:
  - \( P(E_2|H_1) \) (Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller) = 0.3
  - \( P(E_2|H_2) \) (Probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7

We are given that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

To find the desired posterior probability \( P(H_1|E_1, E_2) \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements), we use Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H_1|E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2|H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)}
\]

First, we calculate \( P(E_1, E_2|H_1) \):

\[
P(E_1, E_2|H_1) = P(E_1|H_1) \cdot P(E_2|H_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]

Next, we calculate \( P(E_1, E_2|H_2) \):

\[
P(E_1, E_2|H_2) = P(E_1|H_2) \cdot P(E_2|H_2) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Now, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(E_1, E_2) \):

\[
P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2|H_1)P(H_1) + P(E_1, E_2|H_2)P(H_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85
\]

\[
P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, we can find \( P(H_1|E_1, E_2) \):

\[
P(H_1|E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

So, here's the final estimate:

\[
\{ probability: 0.2323 \}
\]
