To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses and the population information, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Bayes' theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(H\) is the hypothesis (the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(E\) is the evidence (testimonies of the two witnesses).

First, we need to define some events and probabilities:
- \(P(H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen individual is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg H)\): The prior probability that a randomly chosen individual is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(P(E|H)\): The probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true.
- \(P(E|\neg H)\): The probability of the evidence given that the hypothesis is false.
- \(P(E)\): The overall probability of the evidence.

From the information provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\)

According to the witnesses' accuracy:
- First witness: 80% accuracy if 185 cm or taller, and 20% error if shorter.
- Second witness: 70% accuracy if shorter, and 30% error if 185 cm or taller.

Hence:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 + 0.2 \cdot 0.7 \]
\[ P(E|H) = 0.24 + 0.14 = 0.38 \]

\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.7 \cdot 0.8 + 0.3 \cdot 0.2 \]
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.56 + 0.06 = 0.62 \]

Now, we need to calculate \(P(E)\), which is the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E) = P(E|H) \cdot P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.38 \cdot 0.15 + 0.62 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.057 + 0.527 = 0.584 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(H|E)\):

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.38 \cdot 0.15}{0.584} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ \frac{0.057}{0.584} \]
\[ P(H|E) ≈ 0.0976 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (as the first witness claimed) is approximately 0.0976.
