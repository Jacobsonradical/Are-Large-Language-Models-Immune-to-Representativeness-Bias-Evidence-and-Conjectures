To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' reports, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_T \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_T \): The second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1_T | T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W1_T | \neg T) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg W1_T | T) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\neg W1_T | \neg T) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W2_T | T) = 0.3 \) (70% identified correctly implies 30% identified incorrectly)
- \( P(W2_T | \neg T) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\neg W2_T | T) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\neg W2_T | \neg T) = 0.3 \)

We need to find \( P(T | W1_T, \neg W2_T) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller while the second witness claimed otherwise.

Using Bayes' theorem for combined evidence:
\[ P(T | W1_T, \neg W2_T) = \frac{P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | T)P(T)}{P(W1_T, \neg W2_T)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | T) \):
\[ P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | T) = P(W1_T | T) \cdot P(\neg W2_T | T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.7 = 0.56 \]

Second, calculate \( P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | \neg T) \):
\[ P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | \neg T) = P(W1_T | \neg T) \cdot P(\neg W2_T | \neg T) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Next, calculate the total probability \( P(W1_T, \neg W2_T) \):
\[ P(W1_T, \neg W2_T) = P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | T)P(T) + P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | \neg T)P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1_T, \neg W2_T) = (0.56 \cdot 0.15) + (0.06 \cdot 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T | W1_T, \neg W2_T) \):
\[ P(T | W1_T, \neg W2_T) = \frac{P(W1_T, \neg W2_T | T)P(T)}{P(W1_T, \neg W2_T)} = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore,
\[ \{probability: 0.622\} \]
