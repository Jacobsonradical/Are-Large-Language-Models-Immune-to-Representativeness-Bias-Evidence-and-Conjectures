To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define the events and their probabilities:

- Let \( T \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- Probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, \( P(T) \): 0.15 (given the population statistics).
- Probability of the attacker's height being shorter than 185 cm, \( P(T^c) \): 0.85.
- Probability of the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, \( P(W1|T) \): 0.80.
- Probability of the first witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, \( P(W1|T^c) \): 0.20.
- Probability of the second witness correctly identifying the attacker's height, \( P(W2|T^c) \): 0.70.
- Probability of the second witness incorrectly identifying the attacker's height, \( P(W2|T) \): 0.30.

We need to estimate \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed it.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]

Substituting the values:
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.29 \]

Now, calculate \( P(T|W1) \):
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T|W1) \approx 0.41 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
