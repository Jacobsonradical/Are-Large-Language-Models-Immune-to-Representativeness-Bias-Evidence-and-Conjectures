To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. We will take into consideration both the witness reliability and the population distribution. We'll start by defining the events:

- \(A\): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W1\): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W2\): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using the provided information:

1. \(P(A) = 0.15\) (Probability that someone is 185 cm or taller in the population).
2. \(P(B) = 0.85\) (Probability that someone is shorter than 185 cm in the population).
3. \(P(W1 | A) = 0.80\) (First witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller).
4. \(P(W1 | B) = 0.20\) (First witness incorrectly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller).
5. \(P(W2 | A) = 0.30\) (Second witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm).
6. \(P(W2 | B) = 0.70\) (Second witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm).

We want to calculate \(P(A | W1)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

By applying Bayes' theorem:

\[P(A | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)}\]

where \(P(W1)\) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be computed as:

\[P(W1) = P(W1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1 | B) \cdot P(B)\]

Therefore:

\[P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)\]
\[P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[P(W1) = 0.29\]

Now substitute back into Bayes' theorem:

\[P(A | W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[P(A | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[P(A | W1) \approx 0.414\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is:

\[{probability: 0.414}\]
