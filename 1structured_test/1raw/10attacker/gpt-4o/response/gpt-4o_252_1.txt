To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:

- \( H_1 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following probabilities:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(E_1 | H_2) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.70 \)

We are interested in finding \( P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem for multiple evidence, we have:

\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \):
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \cdot P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we find \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) \):
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \cdot P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(E_1 \cap E_2) \):
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we can calculate \( P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) \):
\[ P(H_1 | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
