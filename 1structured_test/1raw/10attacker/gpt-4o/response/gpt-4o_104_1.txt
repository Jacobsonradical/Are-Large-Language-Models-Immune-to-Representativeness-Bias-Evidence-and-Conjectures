To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

In our case:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

First, we need to calculate \( P(A) \), \( P(B|A) \), and \( P(B) \).

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**

From the given information, 
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
(as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).

2. **Calculate \( P(B|A) \):**

This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. From the problem statement, the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time:
\[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]

3. **Calculate \( P(\neg A) \):**

This is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
\[ P(\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \]

4. **Calculate \( P(B|\neg A) \):**

This is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The first witness errs 20% of the time:
\[ P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(B) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer: {probability: 0.4138}**
