To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We need to calculate \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (or 15%).
- \( P(\neg A) \): The prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.85 (or 85%).

The performance of the first witness:
- \( P(B|A) \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller is 0.80 (or 80%).
- \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 0.20 (or 20%).

Bayes' Theorem is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(B) \), the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(A|B) \):
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
