To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Here, we need to calculate the posterior probability \[ P(H_1|E) \], where \( H_1 \) is the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses.

We have the following details:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a randomly chosen person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1|H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1|H_2) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the person as 185 cm or taller given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_2|H_1) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies the person as shorter than 185 cm given that the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_2|H_2) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies the person as shorter than 185 cm given that the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in the case where \( E = E_1 \cap E_2 \), meaning the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem with combined evidence, we have:

\[ P(H_1|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) P(H_1)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]

First, calculate the likelihoods:

\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) = P(E_1 | H_2) \times P(E_2 | H_2) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate the total probability of the evidence:

\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_1) P(H_1) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H_2) P(H_2) \]

\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, we can compute the posterior probability:

\[ P(H_1|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
