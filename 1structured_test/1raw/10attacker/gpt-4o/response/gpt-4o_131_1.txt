To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence provided by the two witnesses, we can use Bayesian inference. The probability can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- Witness 1's accuracy: 80% for >= 185 cm, 20% for < 185 cm.
- Witness 2's accuracy: 70% for < 185 cm, 30% for >= 185 cm.
- Population statistics: 85% are < 185 cm, 15% are >= 185 cm.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is ≥ 185 cm.
- \( B \) be the event that the attacker's height is < 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(A | \text{witnesses}) \), the posterior probability that the attacker is ≥ 185 cm given the witnesses' statements.

First, we calculate the likelihoods:

1. For the first witness claiming 185 cm or taller:
   - If the attacker is ≥ 185 cm: \( P(\text{Claim} | A) = 0.80 \)
   - If the attacker is < 185 cm: \( P(\text{Claim} | B) = 0.20 \)

2. For the second witness claiming shorter than 185 cm:
   - If the attacker is < 185 cm: \( P(\text{Claim} | B) = 0.70 \)
   - If the attacker is ≥ 185 cm: \( P(\text{Claim} | A) = 0.30 \)

Calculate the joint likelihood of the witnesses' claims given each height scenario.

For the attacker being ≥ 185 cm:
\[ P(C_1 \ge 185 \text{ and } C_2 < 185 | A) = P(C_1 \ge 185 | A) \cdot P(C_2 < 185 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

For the attacker being < 185 cm:
\[ P(C_1 \ge 185 \text{ and } C_2 < 185 | B) = P(C_1 \ge 185 | B) \cdot P(C_2 < 185 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | \text{witnesses}) = \frac{P(\text{witnesses} | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(\text{witnesses})} \]

Where:
\[ P(\text{witnesses}) = P(\text{witnesses} | A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{witnesses} | B) \cdot P(B) \]

Given the prior probabilities:
\[ P(A) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.85 \]

Calculate the posterior probability:
\[ P(\text{witnesses}) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Therefore:
\[ P(A | \text{witnesses}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.232}
