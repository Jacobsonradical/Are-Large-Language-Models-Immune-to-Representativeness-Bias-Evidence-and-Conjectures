To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H_{\geq} \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_{<} \) as the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The given probabilities are:

- \( P(H_{\geq}) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H_{<}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_{\geq}) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 | H_{<}) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_{\geq}) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H_{<}) = 0.7 \)

We want to find \( P(H_{\geq} | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

From Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H_{\geq} | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{\geq}) \cdot P(H_{\geq})}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{\geq}) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{\geq}) = P(W_1 | H_{\geq}) \cdot P(W_2 | H_{\geq}) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{<}) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{<}) = P(W_1 | H_{<}) \cdot P(W_2 | H_{<}) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, we calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{\geq}) \cdot P(H_{\geq}) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H_{<}) \cdot P(H_{<}) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, we find \( P(H_{\geq} | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[ P(H_{\geq} | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.2323 \} \]
