To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Letâ€™s define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We are interested in \( P(A|B) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims they are.

From the information provided:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.80 \) (the first witness correctly identifies 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.20 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies 20% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem: 
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

First, we need to find \( P(B) \):

\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(B) = 0.29 \]

Now we can find \( P(A|B) \):

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately \( 0.414 \).
