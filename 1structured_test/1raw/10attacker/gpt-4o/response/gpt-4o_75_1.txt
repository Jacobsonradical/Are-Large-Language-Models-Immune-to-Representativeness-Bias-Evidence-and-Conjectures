To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's denote the following events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that someone in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that someone in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | T) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg T) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | T) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg T) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate \( P(T | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2)} \]

We first need to calculate \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | T) \) and \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg T) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \times P(\neg W_2 | T) = 0.80 \times (1 - 0.30) = 0.80 \times 0.70 = 0.56 \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg T) = P(W_1 | \neg T) \times P(\neg W_2 | \neg T) = 0.20 \times (1 - 0.70) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now we calculate the total probability \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) \):

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | T) P(T) + P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg T) P(\neg T) \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 \]

\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | T) P(T)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2)} = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} \]

\[ P(T | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore,
{probability: 0.62}
