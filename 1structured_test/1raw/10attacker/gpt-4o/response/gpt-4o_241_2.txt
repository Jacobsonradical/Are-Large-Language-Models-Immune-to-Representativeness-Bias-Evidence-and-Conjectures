To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the data, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies an attacker 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability the second witness correctly identifies an attacker shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness said the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness said the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

First, we calculate the joint probabilities:

\( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)

\( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)

\( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Finally, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \)

\( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\{ probability: 0.232 \}
