We can use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements. Bayes' theorem states that:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

1. **Prior Probability, \( P(A) \)**:
   This is the probability that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller. Given the city population data: 
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \]

2. **Prior Probability, \( P(A') \)**:
   This is the probability that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm.
   \[ P(A') = 0.85 \]

3. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A) \)**:
   This is the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
   \[ P(B|A) = 0.80 \]

4. **Likelihood, \( P(B|A') \)**:
   This is the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
   \[ P(B|A') = 0.20 \]

5. **Total Probability, \( P(B) \)**:
   This is the overall probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated by considering both possible true heights:
   \[ P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|A') \cdot P(A') \]
   \[ P(B) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
   \[ P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|B) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.

\[ \{probability: 0.414\} \]
