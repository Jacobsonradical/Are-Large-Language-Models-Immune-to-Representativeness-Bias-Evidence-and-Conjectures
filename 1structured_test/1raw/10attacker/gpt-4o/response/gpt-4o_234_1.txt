To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies and population data, we can apply Bayes' Theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events. 

Given:
- Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \( P(T \geq 185) = 0.15 \)
- Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(T < 185) = 0.85 \)

The likelihoods provided by the witnesses:
- First witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%, so \( P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185 | T \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
- First witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter with an error rate of 20%, so \( P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185 | T < 185) = 0.20 \)
  
- Second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm with an accuracy of 70%, so \( P(\text{second witness says } T < 185 | T < 185) = 0.70 \)
- Second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is 185 cm or taller with an error rate of 30%, so \( P(\text{second witness says } T < 185 | T \geq 185) = 0.30 \)

We want to find:
\[ P(T \geq 185 | \text{first witness says } T \geq 185) \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \geq 185 | \text{first witness says } T \geq 185) = \frac{P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185 | T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185)} \]

Where \(P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185)\) is found by the law of total probability:
\[P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185) = P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185 | T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(\text{first witness says } T \geq 185 | T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185)\]
\[= (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)\]
\[= 0.12 + 0.17\]
\[= 0.29\]

Therefore:
\[P(T \geq 185 | \text{first witness says } T \geq 185) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29}\]
\[= \frac{0.12}{0.29}\]
\[= \frac{12}{29}\]
\[ \approx 0.41 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: } 0.41 \} \]
