To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem to incorporate the information from the witnesses and the population distribution:

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1^{+} \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2^{-} \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H \mid W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) \).

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a person in the city is shorter than 185 cm).

The performance metrics of the witnesses:

For the first witness:
- \( P(W_1^{+} \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1^{+} \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \)

For the second witness:
- \( P(W_2^{-} \mid H) = 0.3 \)
- \( P(W_2^{-} \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \)

To find \( P(H \mid W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) \), we first calculate the joint probabilities using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid H) = P(W_1^{+} \mid H) \cdot P(W_2^{-} \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid \neg H) = P(W_1^{+} \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W_2^{-} \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate the joint probabilities with priors:

\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid H) \cdot P(H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 = 0.036 \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.119 \]

The total probability of the observed evidence:

\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) = P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now apply Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) = \frac{P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-})} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1^{+} \cap W_2^{-}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
