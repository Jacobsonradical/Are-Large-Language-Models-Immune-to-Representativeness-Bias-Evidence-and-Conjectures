To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 = H \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 = H \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- The probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The probability \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

The accuracy of the witnesses:
- The first witness correctly identifies \( H \) with probability 0.8, and incorrectly with probability 0.2.
- The second witness correctly identifies \( \neg H \) with probability 0.7, and incorrectly with probability 0.3.

Using the data:
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \)

We need to find \( P(H \mid W_1) \), which is the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. According to Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated by the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]

Substituting the values:

\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.41 \} \]
