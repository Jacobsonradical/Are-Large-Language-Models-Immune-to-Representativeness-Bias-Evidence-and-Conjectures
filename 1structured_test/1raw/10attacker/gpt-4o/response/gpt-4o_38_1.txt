To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements. Let's denote the following events:

- \( T \geq 185 \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T < 185 \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(T \geq 185 \mid W_1, W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

To find \( P(W_1, W_2) \), we will use the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid T \geq 185) \cdot P(T \geq 185) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid T < 185) \cdot P(T < 185) \]

Given the accuracies of the witnesses:

\- For the case \( T \geq 185 \):
  - \( P(W_1 \mid T \geq 185) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_2 \mid T \geq 185) = 0.30 \)
  So,
  \[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid T \geq 185) = P(W_1 \mid T \geq 185) \times P(W_2 \mid T \geq 185) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\- For the case \( T < 185 \):
  - \( P(W_1 \mid T < 185) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(W_2 \mid T < 185) = 0.70 \)
  So,
  \[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid T < 185) = P(W_1 \mid T < 185) \times P(W_2 \mid T < 185) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Thus,

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we put this back into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(T \geq 185 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:

\[ {probability: 0.232} \]
