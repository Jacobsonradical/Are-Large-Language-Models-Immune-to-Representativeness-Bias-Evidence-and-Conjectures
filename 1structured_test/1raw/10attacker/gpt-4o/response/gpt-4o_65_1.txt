We can solve this problem using Bayes' theorem, which will help us update the probability based on the witness testimonies and the prior information given.

Let's define the following events:

- \( A \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given the following prior probabilities:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \)

Let's define the events related to the witnesses:
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The conditional probabilities related to the witnesses' accuracy are given as follows:
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|B) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2|B) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_2|A) = 0.30 \)

First, let's find the probability that both witnesses gave the testimonies they did. We need to calculate the joint probabilities \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \):

- \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) = P(W_1 | B) \times P(W_2 | B) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Next, we need to find the expected probability that both witnesses gave the testimonies they did (the normalizing constant):

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | B) \times P(B)
\]

\[
P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem, we can find the posterior probability \( P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \):

\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2 | A) \times P(A) }{ P(W_1 \text{ and } W_2) }
\]

\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) = \frac{ 0.24 \times 0.15 }{ 0.155 } = \frac{ 0.036 }{ 0.155 } \approx 0.232
\]

So, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is:

\{probability: 0.232\}
