To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's denote:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( S \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W1|T) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W1|S) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W2|S) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W2|T) = 0.30 \)

We need to determine \( P(T|W1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(T|W1) = \frac{P(W1|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1)}
\]

Where:

\[
P(W1) = P(W1|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1|S) \cdot P(S)
\]

So, plug in the values:

\[
P(W1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85)
\]

Calculate \( P(W1) \):

\[
P(W1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, calculate \( P(T|W1) \):

\[
P(T|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately:

\[
\{ \text{probability: } 0.4138 \}
\]
