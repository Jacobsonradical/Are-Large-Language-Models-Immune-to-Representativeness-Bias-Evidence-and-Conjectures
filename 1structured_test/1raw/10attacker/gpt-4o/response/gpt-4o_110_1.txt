To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the witnesses and the population stats, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) represent the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We'll incorporate the information given by the witnesses into our calculation.

First, define the events:
- \( H \) = the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H^c \) = the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) = the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) = the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(W_1|H^c) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(W_2|H^c) = 0.70 \)

We want to find \( P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2)} \]

First, compute \( P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|H)P(H) + P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|H^c)P(H^c) \]

Where we can determine:
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(W_2|H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2|H^c) = P(W_1|H^c) \cdot P(W_2|H^c) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, plug these into the total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, compute \( P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \):
\[ P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|W_1 \, \text{and} \, W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:

\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
