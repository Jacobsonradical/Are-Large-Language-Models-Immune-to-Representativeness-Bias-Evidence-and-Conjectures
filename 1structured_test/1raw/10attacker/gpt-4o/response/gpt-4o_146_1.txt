To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayesian reasoning. 

We define:
- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1_1 \): The first witness's claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2_1 \): The second witness's claim that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (the prior probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (the prior probability that a random person in the city is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are)
- \( P(W1_1 | B) = 0.2 \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not)
- \( P(W2_1 | A) = 0.3 \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are actually 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2_1 | B) = 0.7 \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they actually are)

We need to compute \( P(A | W1_1, W2_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements. 

Using Bayes' Theorem and considering the independence of witnesses' errors, we have:

\[ P(A | W1_1, W2_1) = \frac{P(W1_1 | A) \cdot P(W2_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1_1 | A) \cdot P(W2_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1_1 | B) \cdot P(W2_1 | B) \cdot P(B)} \]

Now we can substitute the values:

\[ P(A | W1_1, W2_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.15}{(0.8 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.7 \cdot 0.85)} \]

\[ P(A | W1_1, W2_1) = \frac{0.036}{(0.036) + (0.119)} \]

\[ P(A | W1_1, W2_1) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]

\[ P(A | W1_1, W2_1) \approx 0.232 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
