To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to do this:

1. Define the events:
   - \( A_{Large} \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( A_{Small} \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W1_{Large} \): The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W2_{Small} \): The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Calculate the prior probabilities:
   - \( P(A_{Large}) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(A_{Small}) = 0.85 \)

3. Calculate the conditional probabilities:
   - Given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(W1_{Large} | A_{Large}) = 0.8 \), \( P(W1_{Large} | A_{Small}) = 0.2 \))
   - Given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(W2_{Small} | A_{Large}) = 0.3 \), \( P(W2_{Small} | A_{Small}) = 0.7 \))

4. Apply Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
   - \( P(A_{Large} | W1_{Large}) = \frac{P(W1_{Large} | A_{Large}) P(A_{Large})}{P(W1_{Large})} \)
   Where \( P(W1_{Large}) = P(W1_{Large} | A_{Large}) P(A_{Large}) + P(W1_{Large} | A_{Small}) P(A_{Small}) \)

Substitute the known values:
\[ P(W1_{Large}) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W1_{Large}) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(A_{Large} | W1_{Large}) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A_{Large} | W1_{Large}) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
