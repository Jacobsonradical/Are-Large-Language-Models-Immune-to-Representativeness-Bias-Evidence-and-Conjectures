To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (\( P(A) \)), and let \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) be the events that the first and second witnesses identify the attacker as 185 cm or taller, respectively.

We're given the following information:

- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)

The accuracy of the witnesses:
- First witness's accuracy: \( P(B_1 \mid A) = 0.8 \), \( P(B_1 \mid \neg A) = 0.2 \) (error rate)
- Second witness's accuracy: \( P(B_2 \mid \neg A) = 0.7 \), \( P(B_2 \mid A) = 0.3 \) (error rate)

We want to find \( P(A \mid B_1 \cap \neg B_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller and the second witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we get:

\[ P(A \mid B_1 \cap \neg B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid A) = P(B_1 \mid A) \cdot P(\neg B_2 \mid A) = 0.8 \cdot 0.7 = 0.56 \]

Next, calculate \( P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid \neg A) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid \neg A) = P(B_1 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg B_2 \mid \neg A) = 0.2 \cdot 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Now, calculate the total probability \( P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2) = P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2 \mid \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]

\[ P(B_1 \cap \neg B_2) = 0.56 \cdot 0.15 + 0.06 \cdot 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(A \mid B_1 \cap \neg B_2) \):

\[ P(A \mid B_1 \cap \neg B_2) = \frac{0.56 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:

{probability: 0.622}
