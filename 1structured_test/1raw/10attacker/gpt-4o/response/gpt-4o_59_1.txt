To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we can apply Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let's define the events:
- \( T \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg T \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \): Testimony from the first witness (attacker 185 cm or taller).
- \( W2 \): Testimony from the second witness (attacker shorter than 185 cm).

We need to calculate \( P(T \mid W1, W2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given both witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

First, we need to calculate \( P(W1, W2 \mid T) \), the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid T) = P(W1 \mid T) \cdot P(W2 \mid T) \]
Given:
- \( P(W1 \mid T) = 0.80 \) (probability first witness correctly identifies height if \( T \) is true)
- \( P(W2 \mid T) = 0.30 \) (second witness erred, meaning they incorrectly identified height if \( T \) is true)

So,
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid T) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Next, we calculate \( P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) \), the probability that both witnesses give their respective testimonies given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) = P(W1 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(W2 \mid \neg T) \]
Given:
- \( P(W1 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \) (first witness erred, so they incorrectly identified height if \( \neg T \) is true)
- \( P(W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.70 \) (probability second witness correctly identifies height if \( \neg T \) is true)

So,
\[ P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, we consider the prior probabilities:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg T) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We can then compute \( P(W1, W2) \), the total probability of both witnesses giving their testimonies:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T) + P(W1, W2 \mid \neg T) \cdot P(\neg T) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = 0.155 \]

Now, we use Bayes' theorem to find \( P(T \mid W1, W2) \):
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 \mid T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W1, W2)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(T \mid W1, W2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
\[ \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \]
