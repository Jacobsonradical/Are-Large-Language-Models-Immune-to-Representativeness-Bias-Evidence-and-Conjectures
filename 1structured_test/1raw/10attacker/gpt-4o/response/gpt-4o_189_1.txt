To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and the population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. Here's a step-by-step calculation:

1. **Define Events:**
   - \( H \): Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( L \): Attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Prior Probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
   - \( P(L) = 0.85 \)

3. **Witness Accuracy:**
   - \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(W_1|L) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \)
   - \( P(W_2|L) = 0.70 \)

4. **We are seeking \( P(H|W_1) \):**

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

To find \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1|L) \cdot P(L) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, substitute back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H|W_1) \approx 0.414 \]

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

\[ { probability: 0.414 } \]
