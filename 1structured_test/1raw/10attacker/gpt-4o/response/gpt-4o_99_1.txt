To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (let's denote this as \( H \)), we can use Bayes' theorem.

First, let's define the events:

- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\sim H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the city population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witnesses' accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \sim H) = 0.2 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \sim H) = 0.7 \) (second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We will use Bayes' theorem for the first witness:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \sim H) P(\sim H) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.29 \]

Now, we can calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
