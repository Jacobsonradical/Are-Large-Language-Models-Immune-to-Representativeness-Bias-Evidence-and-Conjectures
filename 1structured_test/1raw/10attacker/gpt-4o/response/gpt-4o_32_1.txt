To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \): The event that the first witness claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \): The event that the second witness claimed the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We start by using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | B ∩ C) = \frac{P(B ∩ C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B ∩ C)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller. This is given as 0.15.
- \( P(B ∩ C | A) \) is the likelihood that both witnesses identify the height in their respective ways if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B ∩ C) \) is the overall probability of both witnesses providing their testimonies.

First, let's define the complementary event:
- \( \neg A \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \)

Calculate \( P(B ∩ C | A) \):
Since the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, if the attacker is 185 cm or taller, the likelihood is:
\[ P(B ∩ C | A) = 0.80 \times (1 - 0.70) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Calculate \( P(B ∩ C | \neg A) \):
Since the first witness incorrectly identifies 185 cm or taller 20% of the time and the second witness incorrectly identifies shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time, if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, the likelihood is:
\[ P(B ∩ C | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now we calculate \( P(B ∩ C) \):
\[ P(B ∩ C) = P(B ∩ C | A) \cdot P(A) + P(B ∩ C | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) \]
\[ P(B ∩ C) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.051 = 0.087 \]

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:
\[ P(A | B ∩ C) = \frac{P(B ∩ C | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B ∩ C)} \]
\[ P(A | B ∩ C) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.087} \]
\[ P(A | B ∩ C) \approx \frac{0.036}{0.087} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.4138.

\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.4138} \} \]
