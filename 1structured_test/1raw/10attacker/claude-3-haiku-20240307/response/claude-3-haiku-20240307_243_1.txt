To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A') = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2 | A') = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2 | A) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A | B1, B2) = (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A)) / (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1 | A') * P(B2 | A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A | B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85)
P(A | B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.5926

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5926}
