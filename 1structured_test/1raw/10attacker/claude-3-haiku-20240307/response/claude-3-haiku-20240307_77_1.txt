To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(A^c))

Where P(B1|A^c) = 1 - P(B2|A^c) = 0.30 (the first witness is wrong 30% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm).

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.30 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.255)
P(A|B1) = 0.7021

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7021}
