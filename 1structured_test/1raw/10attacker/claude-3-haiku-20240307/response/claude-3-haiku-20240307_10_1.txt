To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is able to correctly identify the height about 80% of the time.
- The second witness is able to correctly identify the height about 70% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (based on the given population information)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (based on the given population information)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (based on the first witness's ability to identify the height)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (1 - P(B1|A))
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (1 - P(B2|A^c))
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (based on the second witness's ability to identify the height)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.5789

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5789}
