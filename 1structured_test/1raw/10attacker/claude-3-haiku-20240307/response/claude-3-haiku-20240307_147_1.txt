To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population data)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.5882

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5882}
