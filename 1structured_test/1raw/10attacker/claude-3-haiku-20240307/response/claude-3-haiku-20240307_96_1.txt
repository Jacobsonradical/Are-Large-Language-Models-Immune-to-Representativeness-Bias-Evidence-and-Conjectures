To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A') = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A') = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness incorrectly identifies the height 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(W2|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values:

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85))
P(A|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6667}
