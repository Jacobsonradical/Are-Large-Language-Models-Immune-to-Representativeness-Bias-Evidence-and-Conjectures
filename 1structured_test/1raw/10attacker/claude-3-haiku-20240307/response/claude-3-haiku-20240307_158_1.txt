To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A') = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A') = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|A) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is:

P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(W2|A') * P(A'))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85))
P(A|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.3077

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3077}
