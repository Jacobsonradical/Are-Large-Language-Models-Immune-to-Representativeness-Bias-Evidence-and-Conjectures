To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayesian probability.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A^c) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B2|A) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.6923

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.6923.
