To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it to be so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1) = (P(W1|H) * P(H)) / P(W1)

Where:
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H) = 0.15 (the population proportion of people 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1) = P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|~H) * P(~H)
  - P(W1|~H) = 0.3 (the first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(~H) = 0.85 (the population proportion of people shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.39
P(H|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.39 = 0.31

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.31}
