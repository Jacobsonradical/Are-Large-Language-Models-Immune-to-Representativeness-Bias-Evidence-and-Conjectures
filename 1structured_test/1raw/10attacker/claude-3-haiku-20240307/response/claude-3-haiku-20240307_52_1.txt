To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims it is.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / P(W1)

Given information:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Calculating the probabilities:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
