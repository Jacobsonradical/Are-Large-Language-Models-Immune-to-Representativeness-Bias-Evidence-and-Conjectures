To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness was able to identify the correct height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness erred in 20% of the cases)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Calculating the probabilities:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
     = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
     = 0.12 + 0.17
     = 0.29

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
       = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
