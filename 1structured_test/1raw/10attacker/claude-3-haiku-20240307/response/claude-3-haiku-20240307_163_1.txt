To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(A) = 15% = 0.15 (from the population statistics)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy for taller people)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness's accuracy for shorter people)

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.7736

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7736}
