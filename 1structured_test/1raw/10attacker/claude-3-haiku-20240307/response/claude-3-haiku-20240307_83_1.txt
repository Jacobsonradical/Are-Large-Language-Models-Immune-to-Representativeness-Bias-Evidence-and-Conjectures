To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use the provided information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to correctly identify the height about 80% of the time.
- The second witness was able to correctly identify the height about 70% of the time.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information)
- P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's ability to correctly identify the height)
- P(B2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness's ability to correctly identify the height)
- P(B1|A^c) = 1 - P(B1|A) = 0.2
- P(B2|A) = 1 - P(B2|A^c) = 0.3

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.56

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.56}
