To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B2 | not A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A | B1, B2) = (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | not A) * P(A)) / (P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | not A) * P(A) + P(B1 | not A) * P(B2 | A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the given values, we get:

P(A | B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85)
P(A | B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.525

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.525.
