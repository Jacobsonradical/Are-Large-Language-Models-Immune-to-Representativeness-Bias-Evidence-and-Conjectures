To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given the following information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller.
- P(A) = 0.15, the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.43, the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.43 = 0.279

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.279}
