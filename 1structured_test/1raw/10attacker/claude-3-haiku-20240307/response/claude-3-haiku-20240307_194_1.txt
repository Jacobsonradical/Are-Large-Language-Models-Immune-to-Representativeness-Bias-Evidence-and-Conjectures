To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / P(W1)

Where:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8, the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller
- P(A) = 0.15, the probability that a person in the city is 185 cm or taller
- P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.35, the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

Plugging these values into the formula:
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.3429

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3429}
