To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) = Probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- P(B1|A) = Probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- P(B2|A') = Probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as less than 185 cm

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies 80% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A') * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(B2|A) * P(A'))

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.3859

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3859}
