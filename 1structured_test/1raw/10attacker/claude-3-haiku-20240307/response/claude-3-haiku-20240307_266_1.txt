To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness made that claim.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can write:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
