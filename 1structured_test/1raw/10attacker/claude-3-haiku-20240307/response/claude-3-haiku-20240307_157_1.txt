To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / P(W1)

Given information:
- 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller, so P(A) = 0.15.
- The first witness is able to identify the correct height 80% of the time, so P(W1|A) = 0.8.
- The first witness errs in 20% of the cases, so P(W1|not A) = 0.2.
- P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85.

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
