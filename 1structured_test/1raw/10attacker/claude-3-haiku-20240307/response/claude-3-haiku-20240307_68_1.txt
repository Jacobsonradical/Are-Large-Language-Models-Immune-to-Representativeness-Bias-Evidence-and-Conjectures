To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the available information.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, can be calculated using Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / P(B1)

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.47 (the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.47 = 0.255

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.255}
