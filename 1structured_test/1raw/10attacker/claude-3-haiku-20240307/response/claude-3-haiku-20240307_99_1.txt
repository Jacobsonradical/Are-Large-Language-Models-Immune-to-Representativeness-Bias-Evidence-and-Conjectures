To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- 15% of the population in the city is 185 cm or taller (P(A) = 0.15)
- The first witness is able to correctly identify the height 80% of the time (P(B|A) = 0.8)
- The first witness is wrong 20% of the time (P(B|not A) = 0.2)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * (1 - 0.15) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4137

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4137}
