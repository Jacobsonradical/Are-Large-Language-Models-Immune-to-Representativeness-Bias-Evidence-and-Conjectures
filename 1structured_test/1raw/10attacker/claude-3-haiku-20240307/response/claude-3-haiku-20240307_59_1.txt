To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- ~H: The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|~H) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2|H) = 0.3 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|~H) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(H|W1) = (P(W1|H) * P(H)) / (P(W1|H) * P(H) + P(W1|~H) * P(~H))

Plugging in the values:
P(H|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(H|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4615}
