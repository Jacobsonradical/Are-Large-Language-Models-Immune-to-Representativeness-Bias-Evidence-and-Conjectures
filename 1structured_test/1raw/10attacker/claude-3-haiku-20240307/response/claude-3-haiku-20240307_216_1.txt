To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / P(W1)

We have the following information:
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness can correctly identify someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
        = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
