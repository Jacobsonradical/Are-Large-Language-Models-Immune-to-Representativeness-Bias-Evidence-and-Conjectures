To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to correctly identify the height 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to correctly identify the height 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness made that claim:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))
         = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
