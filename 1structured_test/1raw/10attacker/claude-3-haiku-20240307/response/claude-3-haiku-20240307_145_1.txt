To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A') = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A'))
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4615}
