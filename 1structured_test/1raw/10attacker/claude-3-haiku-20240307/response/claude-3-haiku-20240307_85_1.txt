To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to correctly identify the height about 80% of the time, and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to correctly identify the height about 70% of the time, and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability of A given B1 and B2:

P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))

P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness was able to correctly identify the height 80% of the time)
P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness erred in 20% of the cases)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4615}
