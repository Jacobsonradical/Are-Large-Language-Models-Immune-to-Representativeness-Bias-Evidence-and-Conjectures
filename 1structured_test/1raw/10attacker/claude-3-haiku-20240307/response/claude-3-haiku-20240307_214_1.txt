To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use the given information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1 | A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1 | not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2 | A) = 0.20 (the second witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2 | not A) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A | W1, W2) = (P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A) * P(A)) / (P(W1 | A) * P(W2 | A) * P(A) + P(W1 | not A) * P(W2 | not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A | W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.20 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.20 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * (1 - 0.15))
P(A | W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.2353

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2353.
