To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayesian inference.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to calculate P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / P(B1)

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) + (P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A))
  - P(B1|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate when the height is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(¬A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / ((0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85))
P(A|B1) = 0.48 / (0.48 + 0.17)
P(A|B1) ≈ 0.74

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.74.
