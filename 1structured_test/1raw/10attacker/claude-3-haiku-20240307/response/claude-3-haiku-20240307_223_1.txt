To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information about the two witnesses' abilities to identify the correct height.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:

P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B1) = 0.4118 or approximately 0.41

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
