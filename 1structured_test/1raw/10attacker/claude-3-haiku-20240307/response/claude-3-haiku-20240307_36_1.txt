To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (from the population data)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A') = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B) = 0.41

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
