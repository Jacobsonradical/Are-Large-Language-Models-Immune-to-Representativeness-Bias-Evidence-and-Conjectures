To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the available information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness, who claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time.
- The second witness, who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Step 1: Calculate P(B|A)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Step 2: Calculate P(A)
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)

Step 3: Calculate P(B)
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.45

Step 4: Calculate P(A|B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.45 = 0.2667

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2667}
