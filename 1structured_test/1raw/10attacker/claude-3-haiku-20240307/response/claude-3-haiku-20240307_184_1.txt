To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- H: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is able to correctly identify the height 80% of the time.
- The second witness is able to correctly identify the height 70% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(H|W1, W2) = (P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H)) / (P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H) + P(W1|~H) * P(W2|~H) * P(~H))

Where:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W1|H) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time)
- P(W2|H) = 0.30 (the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time)
- P(W1|~H) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time)
- P(W2|~H) = 0.70 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(H|W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
P(H|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.3077

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.3077 or 30.77%.
