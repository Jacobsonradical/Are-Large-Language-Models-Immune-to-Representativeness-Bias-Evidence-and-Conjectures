To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the information provided in the problem statement.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller as "A".

Using the information provided, we can calculate the probability P(A) as follows:

P(A) = P(A | first witness is correct) * P(first witness is correct) + P(A | first witness is wrong) * P(first witness is wrong)

P(A | first witness is correct) = 1, as the first witness claimed the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
P(first witness is correct) = 0.8

P(A | first witness is wrong) = 0.15, as 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
P(first witness is wrong) = 0.2

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A) = 1 * 0.8 + 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.83

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.83}
