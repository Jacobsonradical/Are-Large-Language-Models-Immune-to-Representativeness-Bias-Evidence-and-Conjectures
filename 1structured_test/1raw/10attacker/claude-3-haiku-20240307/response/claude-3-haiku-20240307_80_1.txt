To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- One witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the other claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness made this claim:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
