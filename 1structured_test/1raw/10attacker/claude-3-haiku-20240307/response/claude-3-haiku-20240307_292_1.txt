To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller height 80% of the time)
- P(B1|A') = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies less than 185 cm height as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- P(B2|A') = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies less than 185 cm height 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.15) / ((0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85))
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4615.
