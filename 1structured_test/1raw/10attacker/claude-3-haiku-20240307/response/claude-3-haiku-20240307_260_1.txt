To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the provided information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness made that claim:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
         = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29
       = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
