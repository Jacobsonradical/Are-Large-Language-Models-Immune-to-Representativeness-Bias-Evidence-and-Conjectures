To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(A|B1, B2), we can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|not A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|not A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(B2|A) * (1 - P(A)))

Substituting the given values:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.675

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.675}
