To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: Attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 80% or 0.8.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% or 0.15.
- P(B) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. This is 20% or 0.2.
- P(not A) is the probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

Now, we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4138}
