To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))

Given information:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.17)
P(A|B1) = 0.41

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.41}
