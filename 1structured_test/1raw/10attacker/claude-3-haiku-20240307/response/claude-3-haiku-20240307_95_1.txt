To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time.
- The second witness is able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / P(B1)

Where:
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is able to identify the correct height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)
         = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85
         = 0.42

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42
P(A|B1) = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
