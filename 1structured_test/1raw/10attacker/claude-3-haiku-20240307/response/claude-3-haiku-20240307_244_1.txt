To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness made this claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.4706 or 47.06%

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4706 or 47.06%.
