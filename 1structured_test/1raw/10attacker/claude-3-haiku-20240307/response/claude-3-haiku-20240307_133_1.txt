To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information provided.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A^c) * P(A) + P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A) * P(A^c))

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness is able to identify the correct height 80% of the time.
- The second witness is able to identify the correct height 70% of the time.

Plugging in the values:
P(A) = 0.15
P(A^c) = 0.85
P(B1|A) = 0.80
P(B1|A^c) = 0.20
P(B2|A) = 0.30
P(B2|A^c) = 0.70

Calculating the probability:
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.70 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.30 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.5263

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5263}
