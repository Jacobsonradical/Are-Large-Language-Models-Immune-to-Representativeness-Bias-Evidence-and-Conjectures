To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / P(W1)

From the given information:
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|not A) * P(not A)
P(W1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.7) * 0.85
P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.255
P(W1) = 0.375

Now, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:
P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375
P(A|W1) = 0.32
