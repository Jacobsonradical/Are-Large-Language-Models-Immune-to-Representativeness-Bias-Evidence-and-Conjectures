To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the height is less than 185 cm)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
  - P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
