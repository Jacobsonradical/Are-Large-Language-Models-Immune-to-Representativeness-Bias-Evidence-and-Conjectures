To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the population distribution)
- P(B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) + (P(B|not A) * P(not A))
  - P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
  - P(not A) = 0.85 (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, based on the population distribution)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.42

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.2857

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.2857}
