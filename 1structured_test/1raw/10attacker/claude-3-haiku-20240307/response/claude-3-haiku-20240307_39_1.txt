To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4615}
