To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B), which is the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy rate for this height range).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (based on the given population information).
- P(B) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B|not A) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 (the first witness's error rate for heights below 185 cm)
  P(not A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population shorter than 185 cm)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85 = 0.36

Plugging these values into the Bayes' theorem formula:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.36 = 0.33

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.33}
