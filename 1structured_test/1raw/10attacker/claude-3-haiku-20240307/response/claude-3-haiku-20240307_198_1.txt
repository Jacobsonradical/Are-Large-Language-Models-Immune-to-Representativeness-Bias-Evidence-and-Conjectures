To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem to combine the information provided.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80%.
- The second witness identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm with an accuracy of 70%.

Let's denote the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- C: The second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies:

P(A|B,C) = (P(B|A) * P(A) * P(C|¬A)) / (P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|¬A) * P(¬A))

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness's accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (the proportion of the population that is 185 cm or taller)
- P(C|¬A) = 0.7 (the second witness's accuracy when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(B|¬A) = 0.2 (the first witness's error rate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(¬A) = 0.85 (the proportion of the population that is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B,C) = (0.8 * 0.15 * 0.7) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B,C) ≈ 0.5263

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.5263}
