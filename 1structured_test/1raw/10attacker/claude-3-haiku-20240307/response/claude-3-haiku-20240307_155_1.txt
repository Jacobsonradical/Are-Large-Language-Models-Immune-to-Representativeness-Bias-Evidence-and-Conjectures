To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to use the provided information and apply Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A) = 0.15 (the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.37 (the total probability of the first witness claiming the height is 185 cm or taller)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.37 = 0.324

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.324}
