To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed it was:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was actually 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8, as the first witness was able to identify the correct height 80% of the time.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 according to the information provided.
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * (1 - P(A))
  where P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height was less than 185 cm. This is 0.2, as the first witness erred in 20% of the cases.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85)
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.47

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.47}
