To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is indeed 185 cm or taller. This is given as 80%.
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% according to the information provided.
- P(B) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which we need to calculate.

To calculate P(B), we can use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)

Where:
- P(B|not A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. This is given as 20%.
- P(not A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm, which is 85%.

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.42

Now, we can calculate the probability P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.42 = 0.285714

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.285714}
