To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1 | A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the height is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2 | A') = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the height is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witness testimonies:

P(A | B1, B2) = (P(A) * P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A')) / (P(A) * P(B1 | A) * P(B2 | A') + P(A') * P(B1 | A') * P(B2 | A))

Substituting the values:
P(A | B1, B2) = (0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7) / ((0.15 * 0.8 * 0.7) + (0.85 * 0.2 * 0.3))
P(A | B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.7059

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7059}
