To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed it is.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Given information:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Calculating P(B):
P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.36

Calculating P(A|B):
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.36 = 0.3333

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3333}
