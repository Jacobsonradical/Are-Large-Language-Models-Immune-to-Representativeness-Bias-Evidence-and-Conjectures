Given the information provided, we can calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B: The first witness correctly identifies the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.41 (the first witness identifies the height correctly 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller, and 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.41 = 0.29

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.29}
