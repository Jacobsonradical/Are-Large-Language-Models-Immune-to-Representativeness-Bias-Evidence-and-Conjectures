To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- W1: The first witness correctly identified the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller
- W2: The second witness correctly identified the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm

Given information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W2|A^c) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(A|W1, W2), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1, W2) = (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A^c) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(W2|A^c) * P(A) + P(W1|A^c) * P(W2|A) * P(A^c))

Substituting the given values:
P(A|W1, W2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|W1, W2) â‰ˆ 0.7059

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.7059}
