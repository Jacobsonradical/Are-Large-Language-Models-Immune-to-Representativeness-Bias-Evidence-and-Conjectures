To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- W1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the given information, we have:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1|A') = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate P(A|W1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed it was 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|W1) = (P(W1|A) * P(A)) / (P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|A') * P(A'))

Substituting the values:
P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|W1) = 0.6 / (0.6 + 0.17)
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.78

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.78.
