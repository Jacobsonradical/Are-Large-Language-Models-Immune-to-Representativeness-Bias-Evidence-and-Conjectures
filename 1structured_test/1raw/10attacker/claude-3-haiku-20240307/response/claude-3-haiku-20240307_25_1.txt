To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probability P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. This is 0.8 (the witness's accuracy in this case).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- P(B) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.33

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.33 = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.36}
