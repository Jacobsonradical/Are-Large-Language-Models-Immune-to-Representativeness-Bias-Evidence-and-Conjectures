To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Given:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims it is 185 cm or taller.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A))

Where:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
P(B1|not A) = 0.20 (the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Plugging in the values:
P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)
P(A|B1) â‰ˆ 0.4615

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.4615}
