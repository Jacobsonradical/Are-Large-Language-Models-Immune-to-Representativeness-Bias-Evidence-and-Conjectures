To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use the provided information and Bayes' theorem.

Given information:
- 85% of the population in the city is shorter than 185 cm, and 15% are 185 cm or taller.
- The first witness was able to identify the correct height about 80% of the time and erred in 20% of the cases.
- The second witness was able to identify the correct height about 70% of the time and erred in 30% of the cases.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(B|A) is the probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker's height is actually 185 cm or taller. This is 80% (or 0.8).
- P(A) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (or 0.15).
- P(B) is the total probability that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated as:
  P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)
  P(B) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.35

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.35 = 0.3429

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.3429}
