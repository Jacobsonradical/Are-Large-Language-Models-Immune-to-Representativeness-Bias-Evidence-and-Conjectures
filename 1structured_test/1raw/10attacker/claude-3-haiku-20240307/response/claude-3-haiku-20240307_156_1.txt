To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability given the available information.

Let's define the following:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness made that claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|B1) = (P(B1|A) * P(A)) / P(B1)

We have the following information:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- P(B2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

To find P(B1), we can use the law of total probability:
P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(not A)
P(B1) = 0.8 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.7) * 0.85
P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.255
P(B1) = 0.375

Now, we can calculate P(A|B1):
P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375
P(A|B1) = 0.32

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.32}
