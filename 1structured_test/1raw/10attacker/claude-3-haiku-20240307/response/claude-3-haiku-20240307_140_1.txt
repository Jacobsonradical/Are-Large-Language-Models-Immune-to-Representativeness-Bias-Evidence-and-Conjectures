To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B1: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- B2: The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given information:
1. P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. P(B1|A) = 0.8 (the first witness correctly identifies the height 80% of the time)
3. P(B2|A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
4. P(B1|not A) = 0.2 (the first witness incorrectly identifies the height 20% of the time)
5. P(B2|not A) = 0.7 (the second witness correctly identifies the height 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is:

P(A|B1, B2) = (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)) / (P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|not A) * P(B2|not A) * (1 - P(A)))

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15) / (0.8 * 0.7 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.3 * 0.85)
P(A|B1, B2) â‰ˆ 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.6667}
