Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Let's break down each term:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker was actually that height. This is the witness's accuracy for this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8. 

* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is where the population information comes in. We're told 15% of the city's population is this height, so we can use that as our prior: P(A) = 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims someone is 185 cm or taller (regardless of whether they actually are). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)
   * Where ~A represents the attacker being shorter than 185cm. 
   * We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15
   * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness incorrectly claims someone is tall when they are actually short. This is 20% (100% - accuracy).
   * P(~A) is the probability someone is shorter than 185cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
   * Therefore: P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
          = 0.414 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population information, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
