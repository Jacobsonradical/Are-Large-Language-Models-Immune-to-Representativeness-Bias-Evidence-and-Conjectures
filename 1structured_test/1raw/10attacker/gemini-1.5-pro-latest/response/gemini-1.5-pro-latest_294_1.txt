Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is accurate about height.
* **Base Rate:** We know the general height distribution in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probability (the probability of an event happening given that another event has already occurred). In our case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller *given* that the first witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break it down:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall *given* the attacker actually is tall (Witness 1's accuracy: 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller (the base rate: 15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall (This can happen in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and the witness is right, OR the attacker is shorter and the witness is wrong).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

* **P(B|~A):** Probability the witness says tall *given* the attacker is shorter (Witness 1's error rate: 20% or 0.2).
* **P(~A):** Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (1 - 0.15 = 0.85).

**Putting it Together**

1. **P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
2. **P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Despite the witness's relatively good accuracy, the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller is only around 41.4%. This highlights the importance of considering both witness reliability and base rates when evaluating eyewitness testimony.
