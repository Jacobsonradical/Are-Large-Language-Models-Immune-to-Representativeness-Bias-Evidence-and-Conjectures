Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is correct about height, which gives us a measure of their reliability.
* **Base Rate:** The percentage of the population with heights above and below 185cm is crucial. This is our prior information before considering witness testimonies.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs given new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened. In our case: the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller (A) given the first witness said so (B). 
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened. In our case: the probability the first witness would say the attacker is 185cm or taller given the attacker actually is that height.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A happening. In our case: the probability of a random person in the city being 185cm or taller.
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening. We can calculate this using the law of total probability.

**Calculations**

Let's define:

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: First witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

* P(A) = 0.15 (from the population data)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (witness 1's accuracy for taller individuals)
* P(B|not A) = 0.20 (witness 1's error rate for shorter individuals)
* P(not A) = 0.85 (from the population data)

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
* P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) 
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now, we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

While the first witness claimed the attacker was 185cm or taller, considering the witness's accuracy and the city's height distribution, there's only approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed that tall.
