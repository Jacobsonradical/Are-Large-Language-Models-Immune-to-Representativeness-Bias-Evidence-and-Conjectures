Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let B2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 0.15 (From the given population statistics)
* P(A') = 0.85 (Complement of A, meaning the attacker is shorter than 185cm)

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(B1|A) = 0.80 (The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185cm or taller)
* P(B1|A') = 0.20 (The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185cm as being taller)
* P(B2|A) = 0.20 (The probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185cm or taller as being shorter)
* P(B2|A') = 0.70 (The probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185cm)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given both witness testimonies.  Since it's difficult to directly calculate the probability of both testimonies together, we can use the information from each witness separately and update our belief. 

Let's first consider the first witness's testimony (B1):

```
P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1) 
```

To find P(B1), we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B1) = P(B1|A) * P(A)  +  P(B1|A') * P(A')
P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

Now we can calculate P(A|B1):

```
P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 
```

**5. Updating with the Second Witness**

Now, we'll treat P(A|B1) as our new prior probability and update it with the information from the second witness (B2).  

* **New prior:** P(A) = 0.414
* **New likelihoods:** We'll use the same likelihoods for the second witness as before (P(B2|A) and P(B2|A')).

Applying Bayes' Theorem again:

```
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B2|A) * P(A|B1)] / P(B2)
```

Calculating P(B2) using the law of total probability with our updated prior:

```
P(B2) = P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B2|A') * P(A')
P(B2) = (0.20 * 0.414) + (0.70 * 0.586) = 0.493
```

Finally, calculating P(A|B1, B2):

```
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.20 * 0.414) / 0.493 = 0.168
```

**Conclusion**

{probability: 0.168}

Taking into account both witness testimonies and their accuracy, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.168 or 16.8%.
