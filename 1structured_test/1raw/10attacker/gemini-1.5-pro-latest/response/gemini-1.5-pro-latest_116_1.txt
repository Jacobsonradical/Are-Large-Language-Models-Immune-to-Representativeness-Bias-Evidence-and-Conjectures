Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from 'a'):** There's a 15% chance someone in the city is 185cm or taller. This is our starting point.
* **Witness Reliability (from 'b'):** 
    * Witness 1:  Correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
    * Witness 2: Correctly identifies height 70% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate updated probabilities given new evidence. Here's how it looks in this case:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability the attacker is 185cm+ tall (A) *given* Witness 1 said so (B). This is what we want to find.
* P(B|A): Probability Witness 1 would say "185cm+ tall" *if* the attacker actually was 185cm+ tall. This is 80% (witness reliability).
* P(A): Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm+ tall (15%).
* P(B): Overall probability of Witness 1 saying "185cm+ tall". This needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

There are two ways Witness 1 could say "185cm+ tall":

1. Attacker *is* 185cm+ tall, and Witness 1 is correct (80% of the time).
2. Attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, and Witness 1 is incorrect (20% of the time).

So: 
P(B) = (0.15 * 0.80) + (0.85 * 0.20) = 0.29 

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29  = 0.4138 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**In conclusion, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.38% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
