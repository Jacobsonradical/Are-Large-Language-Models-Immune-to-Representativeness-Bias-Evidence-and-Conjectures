Here's how we can calculate the probability and present the answer in your desired format:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (the city's height distribution) with the new evidence from the witnesses.

**Let's define some terms:**

* Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**From the information given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: Given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, the first witness correctly identifies this 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.30** (Likelihood: Given the attacker is shorter than 185cm, the first witness incorrectly identifies them as taller 30% of the time - this is the error rate)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.30 * 0.85) 
P(B) = 0.375

Now we can calculate P(A|B):

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.375 
P(A|B) = 0.32

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.32} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the city's height distribution and the reliability of the first witness, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is approximately 32%.
