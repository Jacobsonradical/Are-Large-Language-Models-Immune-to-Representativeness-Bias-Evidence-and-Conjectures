Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller *given* that the first witness claimed so. This means we need to incorporate both the witness's reliability and the general population's height distribution.

**Let's Define Some Terms**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We Want to Find:** P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness's statement.

**Information We Have**

* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.2** (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of a person being 185 cm or taller in the city)
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm)

**Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming someone is tall, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)
```

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

While the witness's testimony provides some evidence, the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is only slightly higher than the general population average in that city. This highlights how even eyewitness accounts should be considered within the context of other available information.
