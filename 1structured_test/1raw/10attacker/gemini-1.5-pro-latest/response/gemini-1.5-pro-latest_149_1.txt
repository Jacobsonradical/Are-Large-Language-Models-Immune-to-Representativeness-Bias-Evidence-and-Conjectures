Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given two pieces of evidence:

1. **Prior Information (a):**  There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller.
2. **Witness Testimonies (b):** We have two witnesses with different accuracies in judging height.

This is a classic example of a Bayesian inference problem. We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief (15%) with the witness testimonies.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's testimony.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (from information 'a') = 0.15
* **P(B|A):**  Probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *if* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (witness accuracy) = 0.80 
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and the witness is right, OR the attacker is short and the witness is wrong).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:

* **P(B|~A):** Probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *if* the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm (witness error rate) = 0.20
* **P(~A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

Now we can plug in the values:

P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the prior information and the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
