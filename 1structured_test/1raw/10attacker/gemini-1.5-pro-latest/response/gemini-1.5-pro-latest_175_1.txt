Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The chance of a randomly chosen person in the city being 185cm or taller is 15% (0.15). This is our prior belief before considering witness testimonies.
* **Witness Reliability:** We have information about how reliable each witness is in judging height. This is crucial for updating our belief.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A):  Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B):  Prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's apply this to our problem:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller) 
* **P(B|A):** 0.80 (if the attacker is actually 185cm or taller, the first witness identifies them correctly 80% of the time)
* **P(B):** This is a bit trickier. The first witness could claim someone is 185cm or taller in two scenarios:
    1.  The attacker is actually 185cm or taller (and the witness is correct).
    2. The attacker is shorter than 185cm (and the witness is incorrect). 

We calculate this as follows:
   * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29 

   Where:
     * P(~A): 0.85 (probability the attacker is shorter than 185cm)
     * P(B|~A): 0.20 (if the attacker is shorter than 185cm, there's a 20% chance the first witness would incorrectly say they are taller).

**Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 41.4%.  It's important to note that this is significantly higher than the initial 15% probability based on the city's height distribution alone. The witness testimony, while not perfectly reliable, does provide valuable information.
