Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from population data):** There's a 15% chance that a randomly chosen person in the city is 185cm or taller. This is our starting point.
* **Witness Testimonies:**  We need to incorporate the reliability of the witnesses.  
    * Witness 1 is more reliable (80% accuracy) than Witness 2 (70% accuracy).

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our belief (the prior probability) based on new evidence (witness testimonies).  However, since we're only asked for the probability based on the *first* witness's claim, we can simplify our calculation.

Let:

*  Event A = Attacker is 185cm or taller
*  Event B = Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* that Witness 1 said so.

We know:

* P(A) = 0.15 (prior probability)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Witness 1's accuracy for identifying tall people)

**Simplified Calculation**

Since Witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall doesn't directly tell us anything about the times they incorrectly identify someone as tall when they are actually shorter, we don't need to calculate P(B| not A) or use the full Bayes' formula.  We can focus on the proportion of cases where the witness is correct.

* Out of the 15% of people who are actually 185cm or taller, Witness 1 would correctly identify 80% of them:  0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12

**Therefore, based solely on Witness 1's testimony and the population data, our estimate is:**

{
  "probability": 0.12
}
