Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|W1)** (Probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) =  [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

Since the first witness has a 20% error rate, P(W1|B) = 0.20.

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
2. **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's statement and the base rates of height in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
