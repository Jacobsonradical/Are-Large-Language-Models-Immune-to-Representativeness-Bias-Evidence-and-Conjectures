Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (P(H)):** The background information tells us 15% of the city's population is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability of the attacker being tall.
* **Witness Testimony (W1, W2):** We have two witnesses with different accuracies. 
    * Witness 1 (W1): 80% accurate (correctly identifies tall/short)
    * Witness 2 (W2): 70% accurate 
* **Goal:** We want to find the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (H = Tall) *given* that Witness 1 said so (W1 = Tall).

**Bayes' Theorem**

```
P(H|W1) = [P(W1|H) * P(H)] / P(W1) 
```

Where:

* P(H|W1): Probability the attacker is tall given Witness 1 said so (what we want).
* P(W1|H): Probability Witness 1 would say "tall" if the attacker *is* tall (Witness 1's accuracy for tall people - 80% or 0.8).
* P(H): Prior probability of the attacker being tall (15% or 0.15).
* P(W1): Probability of Witness 1 saying "tall" (this needs further calculation).

**Calculating P(W1)**

We can calculate P(W1) using the law of total probability:

```
P(W1) =  [P(W1|H) * P(H)] + [P(W1|~H) * P(~H)]
```

Where:

* P(W1|~H): Probability Witness 1 would say "tall" if the attacker is *short* (Witness 1's error rate for short people, which is 20% or 0.2).
* P(~H): Prior probability of the attacker being short (85% or 0.85).

Let's plug in the numbers:

```
P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
```

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces to apply Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(H|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 
```

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given Witness 1's testimony and the base rate of tall people in the city, the estimated probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
