Here's how to approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 
* **P(B):** Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" given the attacker IS actually that tall = 0.80
* **P(W1|B):** Probability the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" given the attacker is actually SHORTER = 0.20 (they would be wrong)
* **P(W2|A):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter than 185 cm" given the attacker IS actually 185 cm or taller = 0.30 (they would be wrong)
* **P(W2|B):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter than 185 cm" given the attacker IS actually shorter = 0.70 

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|W1):** The probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming "185 cm or taller", we need to consider both scenarios (attacker is tall, attacker is short):

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)] 
P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|W1):**

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's claim, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
