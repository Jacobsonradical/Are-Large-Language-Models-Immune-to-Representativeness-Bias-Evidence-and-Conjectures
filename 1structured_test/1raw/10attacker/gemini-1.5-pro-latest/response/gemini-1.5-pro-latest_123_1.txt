Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Witness 1's accuracy when the person is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Witness 1's error rate when the person is actually shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.30** (Witness 2's error rate when the person is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Witness 2's accuracy when the person is actually shorter than 185cm)

**We want to find P(A|W1, W2), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given both witness testimonies.**

Using Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability, we can write:

```
P(A|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|A) * P(A)] / P(W1, W2) 
```

Where:

```
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2|B) * P(B)
```

Assuming the witnesses' testimonies are conditionally independent given the attacker's actual height, we have:

```
P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
P(W1, W2|B) = P(W1|B) * P(W2|B) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
```

Now we can calculate:

```
P(W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.155
```

And finally:

```
P(A|W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 â‰ˆ 0.232
```

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness testimonies, is approximately 0.232.**

**{probability: 0.232}**
