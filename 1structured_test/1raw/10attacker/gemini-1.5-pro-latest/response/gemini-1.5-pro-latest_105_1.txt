Here's how to break down this problem to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** The witnesses aren't perfect. The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, while the second is accurate 70% of the time.
* **Base Rate:** This is crucial.  In the city, only 15% of people are 185 cm or taller. This means even if a witness's testimony leans towards "taller," we have to consider the low likelihood of that height in the general population.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (Thinking Conditionally)**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate conditional probabilities – the chance of something being true given that we have new evidence.  Here's how it applies:

* **Event:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Evidence:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

We want to find: P(Event | Evidence) =  P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 says "tall")

**Let's break down the components:**

* **P(Evidence | Event):**  The probability the witness would say "tall" IF the attacker was actually tall. This is the witness's reliability in this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(Event):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall. This is the base rate – 15% or 0.15.

* **P(Evidence):** The probability of the witness saying "tall" (regardless of the actual height).  This is trickier, and we'd need more information about how often each witness would say "tall" even if the person wasn't. 

**Since we don't have enough information to calculate P(Evidence) directly, we can't get a precise numerical probability using Bayes' Theorem.**

**Qualitative Estimation**

However, we can make a qualitative estimate:

* **The base rate suggests a low prior probability of the attacker being tall (only 15%).** 
* **While the first witness is fairly reliable (80%), their testimony alone isn't enough to overcome the low base rate.**

**Therefore, while the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is higher than the base rate of 0.15 due to the witness testimony, it's likely still significantly lower than the witness's accuracy rate of 0.8.** 

**{probability:  >0.15 and significantly <0.8 }**
