Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 
* **P(B):** Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker *is* taller = 0.80
* **P(W1|B):** Probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker is *shorter* = 0.20 (they err 20% of the time)
* **P(W2|A):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker *is* taller = 0.20 (they err 30% of the time)
* **P(W2|B):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker is *shorter* = 0.70

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|W1):** The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's claim.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1):** (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|W1):** (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the first witness's claim and the known error rates, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
