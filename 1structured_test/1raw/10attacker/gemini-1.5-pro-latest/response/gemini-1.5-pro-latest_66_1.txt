Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability (from statement "a"):** There's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person from the city is 185cm or taller. This is our baseline.
* **Witness Reliability (from statement "b"):** 
    * Witness 1 is 80% accurate in identifying heights.
    * Witness 2 is 70% accurate in identifying heights.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is ideal for calculating updated probabilities given new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. 
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**Calculating the Pieces**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of a person being 185cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person)
* P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|not A) * P(not A)] 
    * P(B|not A) = 0.20 (Probability Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall)
    * P(not A) = 0.85 (Probability of a person being shorter than 185cm)

Let's calculate P(B):
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.
