Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  We have a base rate from the city's population: there's a 15% chance a random person would be 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimonies:** We have two witnesses with different accuracies.  We need to weigh their testimonies against the prior probability.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this situation. It tells us how to update our belief in an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given new evidence (witness testimonies).

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B1 = Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B2 = Event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given both testimonies.

Here's how we break it down:

1. **Prior Probabilities:**
    * P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller)
    * P(~A) = 0.85 (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)

2. **Likelihoods (Witness Accuracy):**
    * P(B1|A) = 0.8 (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185cm or taller)
    * P(B2|~A) = 0.7 (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185cm)

3. **Applying Bayes' Theorem (Simplified):**
    We'll use a simplified version focusing on the odds:

    ```
    Odds(A|B1, B2) = Odds(A) * [P(B1|A) / P(B1|~A)] * [P(B2|A) / P(B2|~A)] 
    ```

    * Odds(A) = P(A) / P(~A) = 0.15 / 0.85 
    * P(B1|~A) = 0.2 (First witness incorrectly identifying someone shorter as taller)
    * P(B2|A) = 0.3 (Second witness incorrectly identifying someone taller as shorter)

4. **Calculation:**
    * Odds(A|B1, B2) = (0.15 / 0.85) * (0.8 / 0.2) * (0.3 / 0.7) ≈ 0.225 

5. **Converting Odds to Probability:**
    * P(A|B1, B2) = Odds(A|B1, B2) / (1 + Odds(A|B1, B2)) ≈ 0.225 / (1 + 0.225) ≈ 0.184

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.184}

**Conclusion:**

Considering both witness testimonies and the city's height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 18.4%.
