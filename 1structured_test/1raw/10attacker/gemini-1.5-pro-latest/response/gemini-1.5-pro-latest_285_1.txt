Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**2. State the Probabilities:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is given as the population percentage: 0.15 
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm: 0.85
* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness claims "185 cm or taller" given the attacker IS actually that tall (witness accuracy): 0.80
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability the witness claims "185 cm or taller" given the attacker IS NOT actually that tall (witness error): 0.20

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller GIVEN that the witness claimed so.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming "185 cm or taller", we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]

**4. Calculate:**

* **P(B):** (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* **P(A|B):** (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
