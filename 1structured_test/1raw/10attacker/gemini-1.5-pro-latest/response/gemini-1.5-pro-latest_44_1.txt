Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We have information about how accurate each witness is in judging height.
* **Base Rate:** We know the general distribution of heights in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this kind of problem. It helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given prior knowledge (base rates) and new evidence (witness testimonies).

Let's define:

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's true positive rate, which is 80% or 0.8. 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, which is the base rate of 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the actual height).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]
    * Where ~A means "attacker is shorter than 185cm"
    * P(B|~A) is the false positive rate of the first witness, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the base rate of heights in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
