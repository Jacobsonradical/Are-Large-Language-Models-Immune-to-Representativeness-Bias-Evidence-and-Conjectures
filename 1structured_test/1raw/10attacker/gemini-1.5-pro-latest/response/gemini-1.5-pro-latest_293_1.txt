Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know the witnesses aren't perfect. The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, while the second is accurate 70% of the time.
* **Population Distribution:** This tells us the general likelihood of someone in the city being 185cm or taller. However, this information alone isn't enough to determine the attacker's height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our beliefs based on new evidence.  Here's how we can frame it:

* **Let A be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.**
* **Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.**

We want to find **P(A|B):** the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *if* the attacker actually is 185cm or taller. This is the witness's reliability in this case, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.  We can use the population distribution for this: 15% or 0.15. 

* **P(B):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height).  This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B| not A) * P(not A)
    * Where "not A" is the event the attacker is shorter than 185cm.
    * We know P(B| not A) is 0.2 (the witness's error rate).
    * P(not A) is 0.85 (from the population distribution).

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
