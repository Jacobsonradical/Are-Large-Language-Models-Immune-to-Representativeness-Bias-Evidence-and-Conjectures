Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller given they are actually that height)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm or taller given they are actually shorter)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.30** (Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm given they are actually taller)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm given they are actually that height)

**We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

**P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)**

To find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

**P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]**

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
2. **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
