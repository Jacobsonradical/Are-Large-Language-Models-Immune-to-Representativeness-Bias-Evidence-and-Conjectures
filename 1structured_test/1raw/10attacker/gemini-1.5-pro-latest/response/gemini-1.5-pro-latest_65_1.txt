Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "B" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. State the Given Probabilities:**

* **Prior Probability (from population data):** P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **Witness 1 Accuracy:** 
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies "tall" given the attacker *is* tall)
    * P(B| not A) = 0.20 (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies "tall" given the attacker is *not* tall)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is tall *given* the witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming "tall," we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**4. Calculate:**

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the population data, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
