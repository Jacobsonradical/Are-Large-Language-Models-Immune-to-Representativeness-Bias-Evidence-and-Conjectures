Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down step-by-step:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We know how often each witness is accurate about height. 
* **Base Rate:** We know the general distribution of heights in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us calculate probabilities with new evidence. Here's how it applies:

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B = Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's statement.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker actually is. This is the witness's accuracy rate for this height group, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.  This is based on the city's population distribution, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the actual height).  This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A means the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm. 
    * We know P(B|~A) is the witness's error rate for shorter people, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm, or 85% (0.85).

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the base rate of heights in the city, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller. It's important to note that this is still far from certain, highlighting the limitations of eyewitness testimony, especially when contradicted.
