Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We know how often each witness is accurate about height.
* **Base Rate:**  We know the general height distribution in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this scenario. It helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given prior knowledge (base rate) and new evidence (witness testimonies).

Let:

* **A** be the event "The attacker is 185cm or taller"
* **B1** be the event "Witness 1 says the attacker is 185cm or taller"
* **B2** be the event "Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185cm"

We want to find **P(A|B1, B2)** - the probability the attacker is tall given both witness statements.

**Calculations**

Bayes' Theorem (simplified for this case):

P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2|A) * P(A)] / P(B1, B2) 

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. This is the base rate of 0.15 (15%).
* **P(B1|A):** Probability witness 1 says "tall" given the attacker *is* tall. This is their accuracy for tall people, 0.8 (80%).
* **P(B2| not A):** Probability witness 2 says "short" given the attacker is *not* tall. This is their accuracy for short people, 0.7 (70%). 
* **P(B1, B2):**  Probability of both witnesses giving their specific testimonies. This needs to be calculated considering both cases (attacker is tall and attacker is not tall).

**Calculating P(B1, B2):**

* **Case 1: Attacker is tall (A):** 
    * P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 (since if the attacker is tall, witness 2 is wrong) = 0.24
* **Case 2: Attacker is not tall (not A):**
    * P(B1, B2| not A) = P(B1| not A) * P(B2| not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Now, using the law of total probability:
* P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A) * P(A)  +  P(B1, B2| not A) * P(not A)
* P(B1, B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.155

**Final Calculation**

Now we have everything for Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B1, B2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 = 0.232 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.232} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness statements and the base rate, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 23.2%.  While witness 1 claimed the attacker was tall, their testimony isn't strong enough to significantly outweigh the low base rate of tall people in the city.
