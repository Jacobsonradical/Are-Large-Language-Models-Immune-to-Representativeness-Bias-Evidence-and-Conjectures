Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let:**

*  Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**We know:**

* **Prior probability:** P(A) = 0.15 (from information 'a')
* **Witness reliability:** 
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 (The witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
    * P(B| not A) = 0.20 (The witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness claims someone is tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
