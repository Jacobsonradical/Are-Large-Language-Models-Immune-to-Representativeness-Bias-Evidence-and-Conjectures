Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how reliable each witness is at judging height. This is crucial information.
* **Base Rate:** The city's height distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller) is important. This is the "prior probability" before considering witness testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of A happening given that B happened. In our case: the probability the attacker is tall (A) *given* the first witness said so (B).
* P(B|A) is the probability of B happening given that A happened. In our case: the probability the witness would say "tall" *if* the attacker was actually tall (this is the witness's reliability).
* P(A) is the prior probability of A.  In our case: the probability of a random person in the city being tall.
* P(B) is the probability of B happening (we'll get to this below).

**Calculations**

Let's define:

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: First witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B).  Here's what we know:

* P(B|A) = 0.8 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* P(B) = This is trickier. The witness could say "tall" if the attacker *is* tall, OR if the attacker is short and the witness makes a mistake. We calculate this as:
    *  P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
    *  P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

**Putting it Together**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** This means that even though the first witness claimed the attacker was tall,  the probability of the attacker actually being tall is only around 41.4%. This is influenced by the relatively low base rate of tall people in the city.
