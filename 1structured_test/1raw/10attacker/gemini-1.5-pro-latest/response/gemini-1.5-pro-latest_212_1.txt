Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. State Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(A) = 0.15 (from information "a") - the prior probability of a person in the city being 185 cm or taller.
*  P(~A) = 0.85 (from information "a") - the prior probability of a person in the city being shorter than 185 cm.

**3. State Likelihoods (from witness reliability):**

*  P(B1|A) = 0.80 (the first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
*  P(B1|~A) = 0.20 (the first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 
*  P(B2|A) = 0.20 (the second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 20% of the time)
*  P(B2|~A) = 0.70 (the second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability the attacker was tall given both witness testimonies.  It's difficult to calculate this directly, but we can use the odds form of Bayes' Theorem:

```
Odds(A|B) = Odds(A) * Likelihood Ratio
```

Where:

* Odds(A) = P(A) / P(~A)  (prior odds)
* Likelihood Ratio = P(B|A) / P(B|~A)
* Odds(A|B) = P(A|B) / P(~A|B) (posterior odds)

We need to apply this for both witnesses:

**For the first witness:**

* Odds(A|B1) = (0.15 / 0.85) * (0.80 / 0.20) = 0.706

**For the second witness:**

* Odds(A|B2) = (0.15 / 0.85) * (0.20 / 0.70) = 0.050

**Combining the Evidence:** 

To combine the evidence, we multiply the likelihood ratios from both witnesses:

* Total Likelihood Ratio = (0.80 / 0.20) * (0.20 / 0.70) = 1.143

* Final Odds(A|B1, B2) = (0.15 / 0.85) * 1.143 = 0.202

**5. Convert Odds to Probability:**

* P(A|B1, B2) = Odds(A|B1, B2) / (1 + Odds(A|B1, B2)) = 0.202 / (1 + 0.202) = 0.168

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.168} 

**Conclusion:**

Taking into account both witness testimonies and their reliability, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 16.8%.
