Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given:

* **Prior Information (a):**  There's a 15% chance a random person in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Testimonies (b):** We have two witnesses with different accuracy rates.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

This problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case:  the probability the attacker is 185cm+ tall (A) GIVEN the witness testimonies (B).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened. In our case: the probability of getting the specific witness testimonies IF the attacker was actually 185cm+ tall.
* P(A) is the prior probability of event A. In our case: the 15% chance a person in the city is 185cm+ tall.
* P(B) is the prior probability of event B. In our case:  the probability of getting those specific witness testimonies (this is trickier to calculate directly).

**Calculations**

1. **P(B|A):** If the attacker IS 185cm+ tall:
    * Witness 1 would correctly say so 80% of the time.
    * Witness 2 would incorrectly say they are shorter 30% of the time.

2. **P(B):** This is the probability of getting these specific testimonies overall.  We'd need to consider the probabilities of these testimonies under both scenarios (attacker is tall, attacker is shorter).  This gets complex, and we don't have enough information to calculate it directly.

**Approximation**

Since calculating P(B) is difficult, we can approximate the answer.  Given the witness accuracies:

* The first witness (80% accuracy) is more likely to be correct about the height than the second witness (70% accuracy). 

* Additionally, the prior probability of someone being 185cm or taller is quite low (15%).  

Therefore, while the second witness contradicts the first, the higher accuracy of the first witness combined with the lower prior probability leads us to believe there's still a slightly higher chance the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.

**Estimate**

While we can't give a precise numerical probability without more information, a reasonable estimate, considering the factors discussed, would be:

{probability: 0.6} 

**Important Note:** This is an approximation.  A more accurate probability would require considering the probabilities of the witness testimonies under both possible attacker heights, which we don't have enough information to do.
