Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define:**

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Probability the witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (This is the witness's accuracy for this scenario: 80% or 0.8). 
* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185cm or taller in the city (This is given as 15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller (This can happen in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and the witness is right, or the attacker is shorter and the witness is wrong).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

Where:

* **~A:** Event the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm.
* **P(B|~A):** Probability the witness claims the attacker is tall when they are actually shorter (This is the witness's error rate for this scenario: 20% or 0.2).
* **P(~A):**  Probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm (This is 85% or 0.85).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness's accuracy and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller. It's important to note this is not conclusive evidence, as there's still a significant chance the witness might be mistaken.
