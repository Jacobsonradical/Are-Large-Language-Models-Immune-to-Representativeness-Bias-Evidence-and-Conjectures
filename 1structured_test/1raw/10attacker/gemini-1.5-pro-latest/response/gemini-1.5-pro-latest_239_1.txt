Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker's height is actually 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's claim.

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

**Let's break down each term:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would claim the attacker is tall, *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.  This is where the population information comes in. We know 15% of the city is this height, so P(A) = 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness would claim the attacker is tall (regardless of actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A means "attacker is NOT 185cm or taller." 
    * We know P(B|~A) = 0.2 (the witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly claiming someone is tall). 
    * We know P(~A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter).

**Let's calculate:**

1. **P(B):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
2. **P(A|B):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
