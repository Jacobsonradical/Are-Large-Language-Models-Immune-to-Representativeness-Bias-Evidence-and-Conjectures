Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given:

* **Prior information:** 15% of the city population is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness testimonies:** Two witnesses with different accuracy levels provide conflicting information.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this scenario. It helps calculate updated probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) = Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A) = Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) = Prior probability of event A happening.
* P(B) = Prior probability of event B happening.

**Let's define our events:**

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: Witness 1 says the attacker is 185cm or taller, and Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We need to calculate:**

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | Witness 1 says taller, Witness 2 says shorter)

**Let's break down the components:**

* **P(A) = Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller = 0.15** (from city statistics)
* **P(B|A) = Probability of witnesses giving their testimonies IF the attacker is actually 185cm or taller.** 
   * Witness 1 would correctly identify this 80% of the time.
   * Witness 2 would incorrectly identify this 30% of the time (since they'd claim shorter).
   * Therefore, P(B|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24

* **P(B) = Probability of getting those specific testimonies (regardless of actual height).** This gets a bit trickier. We need to consider both scenarios:
    * **Scenario 1:** Attacker IS 185cm or taller. We just calculated the probability of the testimonies in this case (0.24). We multiply this by the prior probability of the attacker actually being this tall (0.15).
    * **Scenario 2:** Attacker IS SHORTER than 185cm. We'd calculate the probability of the testimonies in a similar way to above and multiply by the prior probability of the attacker being shorter (0.85). 
    * **P(B) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (Probability of testimonies given attacker is shorter * 0.85)**

To calculate the probability of testimonies given the attacker is shorter:

* Witness 1 would incorrectly identify this 20% of the time.
* Witness 2 would correctly identify this 70% of the time.
* Probability = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

Now, we can calculate P(B):

* P(B) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.155

**Putting it all together in Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is 185cm or taller | Witness 1 says taller, Witness 2 says shorter) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 = 0.232

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.232} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimonies and the city's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 23.2%.
