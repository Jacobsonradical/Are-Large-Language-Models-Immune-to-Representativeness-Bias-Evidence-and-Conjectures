Here's how we can approach this problem:

**1. Define Events:**

* Let "T" represent the event that the attacker was truly 185 cm or taller.
* Let "S" represent the event that the attacker was truly shorter than 185 cm.
* Let "W1" represent the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W2" represent the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* From information "a": 
    * P(T) = 0.15 (Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
    * P(S) = 0.85 (Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Witness Reliability (Likelihoods):**

* From information "b":
    * P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (Probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker IS taller)
    * P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (Probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker IS shorter)
    * P(W2 | T) = 0.20 (Probability the second witness says "shorter" given the attacker IS taller)
    * P(W2 | S) = 0.70 (Probability the second witness says "shorter" given the attacker IS shorter)

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker was taller given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1) 

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] + [P(W1 | S) * P(S)]

**5. Calculation:**

* P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the available information and the witness testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
