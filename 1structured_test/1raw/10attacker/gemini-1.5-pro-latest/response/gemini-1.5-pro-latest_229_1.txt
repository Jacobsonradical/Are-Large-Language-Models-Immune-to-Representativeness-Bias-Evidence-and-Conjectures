Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the events:**

* Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

**2. State the given probabilities:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(B|A) = 0.80 (Likelihood: Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(B| not A) = 0.20 (Likelihood: Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 

**Note:** We don't directly use the information about the second witness or the general population height distribution for this specific calculation.

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the first witness's claim. 

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**4. Calculate:**

* P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:** 

{probability: 0.414} 

There is approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement.
