Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* that the first witness said so. This means we'll use the information about the witnesses' accuracy and the general population height distribution to update our belief.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability that the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**Here's how Bayes' Theorem helps:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker actually is 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy for this height category: 80% or 0.8.
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.  We can use the city's population height distribution for this: 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A means "attacker is shorter than 185cm" 
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness claims "185cm or taller" when the attacker is actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate for this case: 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm based on the city's population: 85% or 0.85.

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
