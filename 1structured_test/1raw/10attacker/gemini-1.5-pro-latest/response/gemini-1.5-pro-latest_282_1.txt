Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**Here's how to use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that height (witness's reliability when the attacker is tall). This is 0.8 (80%).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city. This is 0.15 (15%). 
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (regardless of the actual height). This needs to be calculated considering both scenarios (attacker is tall and attacker is short).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:

* **P(B|~A):**  Probability the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when the attacker is actually *shorter*. This is 0.3 (30% error rate).
* **P(~A):** Probability the attacker is *shorter* than 185 cm. This is 0.85 (85%).

Therefore:

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.375

**Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.32

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.32}

**Conclusion:**

While the first witness claimed the attacker was taller, given their accuracy and the city's height distribution, there is only a 32% probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller.
