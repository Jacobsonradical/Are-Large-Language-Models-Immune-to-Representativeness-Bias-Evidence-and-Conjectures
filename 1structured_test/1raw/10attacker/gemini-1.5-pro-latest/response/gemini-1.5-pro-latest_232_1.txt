Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We know how often each witness is correct about someone's height relative to 185cm.
* **Base Rate:** We know the general height distribution in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps us calculate conditional probabilities (the probability of something happening given that we know something else happened). Here's how it looks:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's define the events:

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's statement.

Here's how we break down the terms:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker actually is 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate for this height category, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.  This is the base rate in the city, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of actual height).  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * Where ~A means "attacker is shorter than 185cm"
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness is wrong (20% or 0.2)
    * P(~A) is the probability someone in the city is shorter than 185cm (85% or 0.85)

**Calculation**

1. **P(B):** (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Bayes' Theorem:** 
   P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Result**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Despite the witness's relatively good accuracy, the low base rate of people being 185cm or taller in the city means the probability of the attacker being that tall is still only around 41.4%.
