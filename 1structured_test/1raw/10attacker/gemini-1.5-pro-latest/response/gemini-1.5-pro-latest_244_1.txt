Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "S" be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* From information (a), we know: 
    * P(T) = 0.15 (Prior probability the attacker is tall)
    * P(S) = 0.85 (Prior probability the attacker is short)

**3. Likelihoods (Witness Reliability):**

* From information (b), we have:
    * P(W1|T) = 0.80 (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person)
    * P(W1|S) = 0.20 (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
    * P(W2|S) = 0.70 (Probability witness 2 correctly identifies a short person)
    * P(W2|T) = 0.30 (Probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies a tall person as short)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T|W1, W2), the probability the attacker is tall given both witness testimonies.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|T) * P(T)] / P(W1, W2)

To make this calculation easier, we'll use the fact that the witnesses are providing information independently:

* P(W1, W2|T) = P(W1|T) * P(W2|T)
* P(W1, W2|S) = P(W1|S) * P(W2|S)

We also need to calculate the denominator, P(W1, W2), which can be expanded using the law of total probability:

* P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|T) * P(T) + P(W1, W2|S) * P(S)

**5. Calculate:**

* P(W1, W2|T) = (0.80) * (0.30) = 0.24
* P(W1, W2|S) = (0.20) * (0.70) = 0.14
* P(W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.155

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

* P(T|W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 = 0.232 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.232}

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%.**
