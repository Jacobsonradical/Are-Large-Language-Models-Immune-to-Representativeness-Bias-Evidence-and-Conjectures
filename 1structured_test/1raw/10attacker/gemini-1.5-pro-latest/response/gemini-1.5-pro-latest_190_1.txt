Here's how to break down the calculation to estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayesian reasoning.  Here's what we have:

* **Prior:** The initial probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller is 15% (0.15). This is our starting point.
* **Likelihood:** The witnesses provide evidence that might change our prior belief. We have their accuracies, which tell us how likely they are to make correct judgments.
* **Goal:** We want the posterior probability â€“ the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the witness testimonies.

**Calculations**

Let:

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):**  The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *if* the attacker actually is 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy for this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8. 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller, which is 0.15.
* **P(B):** The probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185cm or taller (regardless of whether the attacker actually is).  We need to calculate this.

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) can occur in two ways:

1. The attacker *is* 185cm or taller, and the witness is correct: P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. The attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, and the witness is incorrect: P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 

Therefore: P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation:**

Now we have everything to plug into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the prior probability and the witness testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
