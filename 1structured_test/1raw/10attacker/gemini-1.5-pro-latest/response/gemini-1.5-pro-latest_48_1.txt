Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Likelihood: The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.3** (Likelihood: The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.3 * 0.85) = 0.375

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.32

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.32} 

**Therefore, given the available information and the witness testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is 0.32 (or 32%).**
