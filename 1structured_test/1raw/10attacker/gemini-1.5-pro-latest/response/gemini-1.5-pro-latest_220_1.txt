Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let "B" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**2. State the Given Probabilities**

* **Prior Probability:** P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's height distribution)
* **Witness 1 Accuracy:** 
    * P(B|A) = 0.8 (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies tall height)
    * P(~B|~A) = 0.8 (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies short height)
* **We don't directly use witness 2's information since we're focusing on the probability given witness 1's statement.**

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually tall given witness 1 said so. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability that witness 1 claims someone is tall (regardless of actual height), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

**4. Calculate**

* P(~A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85
* P(B|~A) = 1 - P(~B|~A) = 0.2 (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies short height as tall)
* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness's accuracy and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.
