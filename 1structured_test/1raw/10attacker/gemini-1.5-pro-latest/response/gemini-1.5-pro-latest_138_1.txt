Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**2. State the given probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of an individual in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of an individual in the city being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability the first witness identifies the height correctly given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability the first witness identifies the height incorrectly given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.30** (Probability the second witness identifies the height incorrectly given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller) 
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability the second witness identifies the height correctly given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|W1)**, the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.  Bayes' Theorem states:

```
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1) 
```

To calculate the denominator, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B)
```

**4. Calculate:**

* **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
* **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the first witness's statement and the base rate of heights in the city, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
