Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let B be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. State the Given Probabilities**

* **Prior probability:** P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's height distribution)
* **Witness 1 accuracy:** 
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 (probability the witness correctly identifies "tall" when the attacker is actually tall)
    * P(¬B|¬A) = 0.80 (probability the witness correctly identifies "not tall" when the attacker is actually not tall)

**3. Determine the Missing Probability**

* We need P(B|¬A), the probability the witness says "tall" when the attacker is not tall. This is the complement of their accuracy for "not tall": P(B|¬A) = 1 - P(¬B|¬A) = 0.20

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem gives us a way to update our belief about the attacker's height given the witness testimony:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying "tall", we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate the Posterior Probability**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.
