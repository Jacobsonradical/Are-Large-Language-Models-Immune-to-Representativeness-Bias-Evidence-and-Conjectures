Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**Here's what we know from the information given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from population statistics).
* **P(¬A):** Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(B|A):** Probability the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" IF the attacker is actually that tall = 0.80 (witness accuracy)
* **P(B|¬A):** Probability the first witness claims "185 cm or taller" IF the attacker is actually shorter = 0.20 (witness error rate)

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming "185 cm or taller", we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
```

**Finally, substituting back into Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate in the population, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
