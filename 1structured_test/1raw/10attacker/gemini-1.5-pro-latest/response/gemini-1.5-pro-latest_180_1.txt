Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We're given how often each witness correctly identifies someone's height relative to 185 cm. This is different from just saying they're 80% or 70% accurate overall.
* **Base Rate:** The population height distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller) is crucial. This is the baseline chance of a randomly selected person being 185cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is perfectly suited for Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate updated probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(A|B):** Probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller) given that event B (witness 1 said so) occurred. This is what we want.
* **P(B|A):** Probability of event B (witness 1 saying 185cm or taller) given that event A (attacker IS 185cm or taller) is true. This is the witness's reliability (80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of event A (attacker is 185cm or taller), which is the base rate (15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of event B (witness 1 saying 185cm or taller) happening. This needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

Witness 1 could say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1. **Attacker IS tall, and witness is correct:**  P(tall) * P(correct | tall) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **Attacker IS NOT tall, but witness is wrong:** P(not tall) * P(incorrect | not tall) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

So, P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

Now we have all the pieces for Bayes' Theorem:

P(Attacker is tall | Witness 1 said tall) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Important Note:**  The second witness's testimony, while seemingly contradictory, is actually incorporated into the calculation of P(B). It contributes to the overall likelihood of witness 1 making that statement.
