Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief (85% are shorter than 185cm) with the witness testimonies to find a more accurate probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller.

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We know:**

* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone being 185cm or taller)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.8** (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies someone as tall given they are actually tall)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.2** (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as tall given they are actually short)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.7** (Probability witness 2 correctly identifies someone as short given they are actually short)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.3** (Probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as short given they are actually tall)

**We want to find: P(A|W1),** the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = P(W1|A) * P(A) + P(W1|B) * P(B) 
P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|W1):**

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
