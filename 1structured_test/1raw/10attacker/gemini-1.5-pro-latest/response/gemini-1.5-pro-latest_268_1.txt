Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is correct about someone's height relative to 185 cm. 
* **Population Distribution:** We know the general height distribution in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This type of problem can be solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probabilities (the probability of something happening given that something else has already happened).

Let:

*  `A` be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  `B` be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find `P(A|B)`, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the first witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

 `P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)`

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims "185 cm or taller" *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's reliability in this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is based on the city's population distribution, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims "185 cm or taller" (regardless of the actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * `P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)` 
    * Where `~A` means the attacker is shorter than 185cm.
    * `P(B|~A)` is the probability the witness claims "185 cm or taller" when the attacker is actually shorter. This is the witness's error rate, which is 20% or 0.2.
    * `P(~A)` is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm based on the city's population, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   *  `P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29` 

2. **Calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' Theorem:**
   * `P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414`

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.**
