Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let:**

*  Event A: The attacker's height is 185cm or taller.
*  Event B: The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

We can use Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(A):**  Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. This is given as 15% or 0.15.
* **P(B|A):**  Likelihood of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy in this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8.
* **P(B):** Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A represents the event that the attacker is shorter than 185cm.
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness incorrectly claims someone is 185cm or taller when they are actually shorter. This is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability the attacker is shorter than 185cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B):**  (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 
2. **P(A|B):**  (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
