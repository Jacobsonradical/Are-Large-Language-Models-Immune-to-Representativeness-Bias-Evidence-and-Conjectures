Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
*  **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is 185cm or taller = 0.15 
* **P(B):** Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185cm = 0.85
* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness claims 185cm+ given the attacker *is* 185cm+ = 0.80
* **P(W1|B):** Probability the first witness claims 185cm+ given the attacker *is shorter* = 0.20 (the error rate)
* **P(W2|A):** Probability the second witness claims shorter given the attacker *is* 185cm+ = 0.30 (the error rate)
* **P(W2|B):** Probability the second witness claims shorter given the attacker *is shorter* = 0.70

**We want to find P(A|W1),** the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's statement.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1) 

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the first witness's statement and the base rates, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
