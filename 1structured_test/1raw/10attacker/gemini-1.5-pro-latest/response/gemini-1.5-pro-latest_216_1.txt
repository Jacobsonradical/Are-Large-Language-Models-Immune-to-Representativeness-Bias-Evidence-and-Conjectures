Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "S" be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(T) = 0.15 (from the given population statistics)
*  P(S) = 0.85 (from the given population statistics)

**3. Witness Reliabilities (Likelihoods):**

*  P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (The probability the first witness correctly identifies a tall person)
*  P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies a short person as tall)
*  P(W2 | T) = 0.30 (The probability the second witness incorrectly identifies a tall person as short)
*  P(W2 | S) = 0.70 (The probability the second witness correctly identifies a short person)

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1, W2), the probability the attacker is tall given both witness statements.  Bayes' Theorem gives us:

P(T | W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1, W2)

To make this calculation easier, we'll use the fact that the witness statements are assumed to be independent given the actual height of the attacker. This means:

P(W1, W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) * P(W2 | T) 
P(W1, W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) * P(W2 | S)

We also need to calculate the denominator, P(W1, W2), which represents the overall probability of observing the two witness statements. We can find this using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) =  P(W1, W2 | T) * P(T)  +  P(W1, W2 | S) * P(S)

**5. Calculation:**

* P(W1, W2 | T) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
* P(W1, W2 | S) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
* P(W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.155

Now we can plug these values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1, W2) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.155 = 0.232

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.232} 

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and their reliabilities, is approximately 0.232 or 23.2%. This is a relatively low probability, suggesting that it's more likely the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, even though the first witness claimed otherwise.
