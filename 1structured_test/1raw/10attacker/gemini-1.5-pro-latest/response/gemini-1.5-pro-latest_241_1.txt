Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **C:** The event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B, C):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually that height.
* **P(B|not A) = 0.20:** Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given they are actually shorter.
* **P(C|A) = 0.30:** Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm given they are actually that height. 
* **P(C|not A) = 0.70:** Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm given they are actually that height.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We can't directly calculate P(A|B, C). Instead, we can use the odds form of Bayes' Theorem:

```
odds(A|B, C) = odds(A) * likelihood ratio(B, C|A) 
```

Where:

* **odds(A) = P(A) / (1 - P(A)):** Prior odds of the attacker being 185cm or taller.
* **likelihood ratio(B, C|A) =  [P(B|A) * P(C|A)] / [P(B|not A) * P(C|not A)]**

**Calculations:**

1. **odds(A) = 0.15 / (1 - 0.15) = 3/17**

2. **likelihood ratio(B, C|A) = (0.80 * 0.30) / (0.20 * 0.70) = 12/7**

3. **odds(A|B, C) = (3/17) * (12/7) = 36/119**

**Converting odds back to probability:**

```
P(A|B, C) = odds(A|B, C) / (1 + odds(A|B, C)) 
            = (36/119) / (1 + 36/119)
            = 0.233
```

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.233} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimonies and the base rate of heights in the city, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 23.3%. It's important to note that this is just an estimate, and other factors not included in the problem could influence the actual probability.
