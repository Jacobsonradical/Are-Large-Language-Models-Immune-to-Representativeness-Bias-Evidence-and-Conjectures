Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  We know from the city's population data that there's a 15% chance a randomly chosen person is 185cm or taller. This is our prior belief before considering witness testimonies.
* **Witness Reliability:** Each witness has a certain accuracy in judging height, which is crucial for updating our belief.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating our beliefs based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller) given that event B (witness testimonies) has occurred.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B (witness testimonies) happening given that event A (attacker being 185cm or taller) is true.
* P(A):  Prior probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller) - 0.15
* P(B): Probability of event B (witness testimonies) happening.

**Calculating the Pieces**

* **P(B|A):** Let's break this down:
    * If the attacker *was* 185cm or taller, the first witness would have correctly identified it with 80% probability (and been wrong with 20% probability).
    * The second witness would have incorrectly identified the height with 30% probability (and been correct with 70% probability).

* **P(B):** This is the probability of getting the specific witness testimonies we did. It's a bit trickier to calculate directly. We need to consider both scenarios (attacker taller than 185cm and attacker shorter than 185cm) and how likely the testimonies are in each. 

**Simplifying the Calculation**

Since calculating P(B) directly is complex, we can use a shortcut for this problem.  We're interested in the *ratio* of probabilities: the probability the attacker was 185cm or taller *given* the testimonies, compared to the probability they were shorter.

This ratio can be expressed using the odds form of Bayes' Theorem:

```
Odds(A|B) = Likelihood Ratio * Prior Odds
```

Where:

* **Odds(A|B):**  The odds of the attacker being 185cm or taller given the testimonies.
* **Likelihood Ratio:** The ratio of the likelihood of the testimonies given the attacker *is* 185cm or taller, compared to the likelihood given they are *shorter* than 185cm.
* **Prior Odds:**  The prior odds of the attacker being 185cm or taller (0.15 / 0.85)

**Calculating the Likelihood Ratio**

* **Scenario 1: Attacker is 185cm or taller**
    * Likelihood of testimonies: 0.8 (witness 1 correct) * 0.3 (witness 2 incorrect) = 0.24 
* **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter than 185cm**
    * Likelihood of testimonies: 0.2 (witness 1 incorrect) * 0.7 (witness 2 correct) = 0.14

* **Likelihood Ratio:** 0.24 / 0.14 = approximately 1.71

**Final Calculation**

1. **Prior Odds:** 0.15 / 0.85 = approximately 0.176
2. **Posterior Odds:**  1.71 (likelihood ratio) * 0.176 (prior odds) = approximately 0.301

**Converting Odds to Probability**

Odds of 0.301 mean a probability of  0.301 / (1 + 0.301) = approximately 0.231

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.231} 

**Conclusion**

Taking into account both the city's height distribution and the reliability of the witnesses, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is about 0.231 or 23.1%.
