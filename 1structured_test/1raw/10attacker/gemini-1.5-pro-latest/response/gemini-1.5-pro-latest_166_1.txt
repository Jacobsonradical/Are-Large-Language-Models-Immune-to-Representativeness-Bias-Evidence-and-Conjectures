Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given the following probabilities:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being taller)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.30** (Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as being shorter)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

**We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker was 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

We can use Bayes' theorem:

**P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)**

To calculate the denominator, P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

**P(W1) =  [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]**

**Let's plug in the numbers:**

* **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
* **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
