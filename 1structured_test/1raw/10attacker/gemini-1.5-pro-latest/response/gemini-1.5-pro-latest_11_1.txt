Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the events:**

*  Let A be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let B2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. State the given probabilities:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(¬A) = 0.85 (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* P(B1|A) = 0.80 (Likelihood: Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(B1|¬A) = 0.20 (Likelihood: Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 
* P(B2|A) = 0.20 (Likelihood: Witness 2 incorrectly identifies tall people as short 20% of the time)
* P(B2|¬A) = 0.70 (Likelihood: Witness 2 correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability the attacker is tall given both witness testimonies.  Since it's difficult to directly calculate P(B1, B2), we can use the fact that the witness testimonies are conditionally independent given the attacker's height:

* P(B1, B2 | A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A)
* P(B1, B2 | ¬A) = P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A)

Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:

```
P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A)] / P(B1, B2) 
             = [P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A)] / [P(B1, B2 | A) * P(A) + P(B1, B2 | ¬A) * P(¬A)]
             = [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A)] / [P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) * P(A) + P(B1|¬A) * P(B2|¬A) * P(¬A)]
```

**4. Calculate:**

Substitute the given probabilities into the formula:

```
P(A|B1, B2) = (0.80 * 0.20 * 0.15) / [(0.80 * 0.20 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)] 
             ≈ 0.125 / 0.143
             ≈ 0.874
```

**Answer:** {probability: 0.874} 

**Conclusion:**

Despite one witness claiming the attacker was shorter, the probability that the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller (as the first witness claimed) is approximately 87.4%. This is because the first witness's higher accuracy significantly influences the posterior probability.
