Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We don't know if either witness is telling the truth, but we know how reliable they are at judging height. 
    * Witness 1: 80% accurate
    * Witness 2: 70% accurate
* **Population Baseline:** This tells us how common the attacker's height is in the general population. This is important background information.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best tackled with Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probability (the probability of something happening given that something else has already happened).

Let:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)**: the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* that Witness 1 said so.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability Witness 1 would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate: 0.8 (80%).

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. This is based on the city's population: 0.15 (15%).

* **P(B):** The probability Witness 1 would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, regardless of the attacker's actual height. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * Where ~A is the event that the attacker is *shorter* than 185cm.
    * P(B|~A) is the probability Witness 1 would mistakenly say the attacker is tall when they are actually short (this is 0.2 or 20%).
    * P(~A) is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm in the population (0.85 or 85%).

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Despite Witness 1's claim, there is only about a 41.4% probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller. The relatively high proportion of shorter people in the population brings down the overall probability.
