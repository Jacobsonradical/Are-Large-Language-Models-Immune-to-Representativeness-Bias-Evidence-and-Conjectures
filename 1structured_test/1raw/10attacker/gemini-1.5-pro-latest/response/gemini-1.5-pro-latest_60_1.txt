Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A):** Prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
* **P(B):** Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85
* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker *is* taller = 0.80
* **P(W1|B):** Probability the first witness claims "taller" given the attacker *is* shorter = 0.20 (they err 20% of the time)
* **P(W2|A):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker *is* taller = 0.20 (they err 30% of the time)
* **P(W2|B):** Probability the second witness claims "shorter" given the attacker *is* shorter = 0.70 

**We want to find: P(A|W1),** the probability the attacker was actually taller given the first witness's claim.

**Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

Where P(W1) is the overall probability of the first witness claiming "taller", which can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the first witness's claim and the known information about witness reliability and population height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
