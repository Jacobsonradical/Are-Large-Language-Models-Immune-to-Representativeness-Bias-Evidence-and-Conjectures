Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into steps:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "T" be the event that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2.  Information Given**

* **Prior Probability (from population data):** 
    * P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
    * P(~T) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm) 
* **Witness Reliability:**
    * P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies "tall" 80% of the time when the person is actually tall)
    * P(~W1 | ~T) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies "not tall" 80% of the time when the person is actually not tall)
    * P(W2 | ~T) = 0.70 (Second witness correctly identifies "not tall" 70% of the time when the person is actually not tall)
    * P(~W2 | T) = 0.70 (Second witness correctly identifies "tall" 70% of the time when the person is actually tall)

**3. What We Need to Find**

* P(T | W1) =  The probability the attacker is truly tall given that the first witness claimed they were tall.

**4.  Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our belief about an event (in this case, the attacker's height) given new evidence (the witness testimony):

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To calculate the denominator, P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] + [P(W1 | ~T) * P(~T)]

**5. Calculation**

* **Calculate P(W1):**
    * P(W1 | ~T) = 1 - P(~W1 | ~T) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20
    * P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

* **Calculate P(T | W1):**
    * P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.**
