Here's how to approach this problem:

We'll use Bayes' Theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's height with the new evidence from the witnesses.

* **Prior:** The probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller before considering witness testimonies. This is given as the population distribution: 15% (0.15).
* **Likelihood:** The probability of the witness giving their specific testimony given the attacker's true height. We have this information for both witnesses.
* **Posterior:**  The probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller after considering the witness testimonies. This is what we want to calculate.

**Let's break it down:**

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

* **We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given Witness 1 said they were.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Likelihood of Witness 1 saying the attacker is 185cm or taller GIVEN the attacker IS actually 185cm or taller (This is 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (This is 15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** Probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker is 185cm or taller (This needs to be calculated).

**Calculating P(B):**

This can happen in two ways:

1. **The attacker IS 185cm+ AND Witness 1 is correct:** P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **The attacker IS NOT 185cm+ AND Witness 1 is incorrect:** P(~A) * P(B|~A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17

Therefore: 
P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Finally, plugging everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
