Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some events:**

*  **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
*  **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies height given the attacker is 185cm or taller)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.20** (Probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies height given the attacker is 185cm or taller)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability witness 2 correctly identifies height given the attacker is shorter than 185cm)

**We want to find: P(A|W1, W2)**  (The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given both witness testimonies)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|A) * P(A)] / P(W1, W2)

Since the witnesses are assumed to make judgments independently, we have:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A) 

To get the denominator, we use the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A)  +  P(W1, W2|B) * P(B)

**Putting it all together:**

1.  **P(W1, W2|A) = 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.16**
2.  **P(W1, W2|B) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14**
3.  **P(W1, W2) = (0.16 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.143**
4.  **P(A|W1, W2) = (0.16 * 0.15) / 0.143 = 0.168**

**Therefore:**

{probability: 0.168}

**Conclusion:**

The probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies, is approximately 16.8%.  Even though the first witness claimed the attacker was taller, the relatively low prior probability of someone being that height in the population, combined with the error rates of the witnesses, means the overall probability remains low.
