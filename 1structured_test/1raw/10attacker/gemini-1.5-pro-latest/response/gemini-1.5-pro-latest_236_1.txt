Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B1|A) = 0.8** (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(B1|¬A) = 0.2** (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

To find P(B1), the probability of the first witness claiming someone is tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] + [P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
