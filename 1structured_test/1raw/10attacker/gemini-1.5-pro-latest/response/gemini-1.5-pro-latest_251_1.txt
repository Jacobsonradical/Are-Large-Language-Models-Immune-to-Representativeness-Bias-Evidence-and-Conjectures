Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is right about height, but not if they were right in this specific instance.
* **Base Rate:** The general population's height distribution is important. Attackers aren't randomly selected, but knowing the base rate helps.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this. It tells us how to update a belief given new evidence.  Here's a breakdown:

* **Let "Tall" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.**
* **Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is tall.**

We want to find **P(Tall | W1)**, the probability the attacker is tall *given* the first witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(Tall | W1) = [P(W1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] / P(W1)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(W1 | Tall):** The probability the witness says "tall" *given* the attacker *is* tall. This is the witness's reliability when they are correct (80% or 0.8).
* **P(Tall):** The prior probability of an attacker being tall. We can use the city's height distribution as a proxy (15% or 0.15).
* **P(W1):** The probability the witness says "tall" (regardless of the actual height).  This is trickier and requires us to consider both scenarios (attacker is tall and witness is right, OR attacker is short and witness is wrong).

**Calculating P(W1):**

P(W1) = [P(W1 | Tall) * P(Tall)] + [P(W1 | Not Tall) * P(Not Tall)]

* P(W1 | Not Tall) = 0.2 (witness's error rate)
* P(Not Tall) = 0.85 (from the city's height distribution)

**Putting it Together**

1. **Calculate P(W1):**
   P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29 

2. **Calculate P(Tall | W1):**
   P(Tall | W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Important Note:**  This calculation relies on the assumption that the city's height distribution is a reasonable proxy for the likelihood of an attacker being a certain height. In reality, there could be many factors that make this assumption inaccurate.
