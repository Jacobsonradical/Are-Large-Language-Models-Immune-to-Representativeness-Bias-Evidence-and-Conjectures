Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let:**

*  Event A: The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
*  Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

**From the information given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller given they are actually that height)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.30** (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm or taller given they are actually shorter) 
* **P(not A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 

Where P(B) is calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.30 * 0.85) = 0.375**

2. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.32**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.32} 

Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rates of height in the city, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is 0.32.
