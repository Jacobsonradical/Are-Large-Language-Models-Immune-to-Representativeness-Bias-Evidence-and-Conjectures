Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall. This is the witness's accuracy rate for tall people, which is 80% or 0.8. 

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. We can use the city's population data for this: 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is tall (regardless of the attacker's actual height). We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A means "attacker is shorter than 185cm"
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness claims "tall" when the attacker is short (their error rate for short people), which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm based on the city's population: 85% or 0.85.

**Now, let's plug in the values:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
