Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We know:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:**  Prior probability of someone in the city being 185 cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:** Probability the first witness would claim the attacker was tall, given the attacker *was* tall.
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** Probability the first witness would claim the attacker was tall, given the attacker was *not* tall (this is the witness's error rate for this scenario).

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming the attacker was tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**{probability: 0.414}**
