Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

*  Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  Let "S" be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185cm.
*  Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
*  Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

*  P(T) = 0.15 (from the city's height distribution)
*  P(S) = 0.85 

**3. Likelihoods (Witness Reliability):**

*  P(W1|T) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies "tall" 80% of the time)
*  P(W1|S) = 0.20 (First witness incorrectly identifies "tall" 20% of the time)
*  P(W2|S) = 0.70 (Second witness correctly identifies "short" 70% of the time)
*  P(W2|T) = 0.30 (Second witness incorrectly identifies "short" 30% of the time)

**4.  Bayes' Theorem (to find the posterior probability):**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1) 

To find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming "tall", we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) =  [P(W1|T) * P(T)] + [P(W1|S) * P(S)]

**5. Calculation:**

*  P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
*  P(T|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
