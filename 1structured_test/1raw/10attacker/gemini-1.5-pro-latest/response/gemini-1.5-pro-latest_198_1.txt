Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
* **Witness 1:** The witness who claimed the attacker was 185cm or taller.
* **Witness 2:** The witness who claimed the attacker was shorter than 185cm.

**We want to find:** P(A|Witness 1), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

**Information we have:**

* **Prior probability:** P(A) = 0.15 (from the city's height distribution)
* **Witness 1 accuracy:** 
    * P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" | A) = 0.80 (true positive)
    * P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" | B) = 0.20 (false positive) 
* **We don't need the second witness's information**  since we're specifically interested in the probability given the *first* witness's statement.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|Witness 1) = [P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" | A) * P(A)] / P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller")

To calculate the denominator, we use the law of total probability:

P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller") = [P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" | A) * P(A)] + [P(Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" | B) * P(B)] 
                                           = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
                                           = 0.29

**Putting it all together:**

P(A|Witness 1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
