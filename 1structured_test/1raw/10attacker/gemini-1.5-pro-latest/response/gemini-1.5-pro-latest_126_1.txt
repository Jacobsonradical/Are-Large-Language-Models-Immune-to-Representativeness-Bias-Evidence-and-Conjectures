Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the events:**

*  Let "T" be the event that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "S" be the event that the attacker is truly shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. State the given probabilities:**

*  P(T) = 0.15 (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
*  P(S) = 0.85 (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)
*  P(W1|T) = 0.80 (Probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker is actually taller)
*  P(W1|S) = 0.20 (Probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker is actually shorter)
*  P(W2|T) = 0.20 (Probability the second witness says "shorter" given the attacker is actually taller)
*  P(W2|S) = 0.70 (Probability the second witness says "shorter" given the attacker is actually shorter)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T|W1), the probability the attacker is actually taller given the first witness said they were taller. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T|W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] / P(W1) 

To find P(W1), the probability of the first witness saying "taller", we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|T) * P(T)] + [P(W1|S) * P(S)]
P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**4. Calculate the Posterior Probability:**

Now we can plug the values back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T|W1) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony and the base rates, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
