Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is accurate about height. This is different from whether they are right or wrong in this specific case.
* **Base Rate:**  The city's height distribution (85% shorter, 15% taller) is crucial.  This is the "prior probability" before we consider witness statements.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for updating probabilities with new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B) is the probability of event A happening given that event B has happened (what we want to find).
* P(B|A) is the probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A) is the probability of event A happening (the prior probability).
* P(B) is the probability of event B happening.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**What We Need**

* **P(A):** Prior probability of attacker being 185cm+ (from city data) = 0.15
* **P(B|A):** Probability witness 1 correctly identifies someone 185cm+ = 0.80
* **P(B):**  Probability witness 1 says "185cm+" (regardless of actual height). This is trickier and needs further calculation.

**Calculating P(B)**

We need to consider both scenarios where the witness might say "185cm+":

1. **Attacker IS 185cm+, witness is RIGHT:**  P(A) * P(B|A) = 0.15 * 0.80 = 0.12
2. **Attacker is SHORTER, witness is WRONG:** P(not A) * P(B|not A) = 0.85 * 0.20 = 0.17

P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witnesses' judgments are independent of each other and the base rate. In reality, factors like lighting or the witnesses' own heights could influence their accuracy.
