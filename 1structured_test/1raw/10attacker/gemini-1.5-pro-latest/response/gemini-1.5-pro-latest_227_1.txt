Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement.**

Here's how to break it down:

1. **Prior Probability (P(A)):** This is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based solely on the city's population distribution.  We're given that 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. 
   * P(A) = 0.15

2. **Likelihood (P(B|A)):** This is the probability the witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually that height. We're told the first witness is correct 80% of the time in similar situations.
   * P(B|A) = 0.80

3. **Likelihood (P(B| not A)):** This is the probability the witness would claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually *shorter* than 185 cm. This is the witness's false positive rate, which is 20%.
   * P(B| not A) = 0.20

4. **Prior Probability (P(not A)):** This is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm based on the city's population.
   * P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85

**Now we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / (0.80 * 0.15 + 0.20 * 0.85)

P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.4138

**Answer:** {probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 41.38%.**
