Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We want to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**From the given information:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Likelihood: The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Likelihood: The first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time)

**We don't actually need the information from the second witness to answer the question.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1) 
```

To find P(W1), the probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]
     = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85)
     = 0.29
```

**Now we can calculate P(A|W1):**

```
P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
         = 0.4138
```

**Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.**

**{probability: 0.4138}**
