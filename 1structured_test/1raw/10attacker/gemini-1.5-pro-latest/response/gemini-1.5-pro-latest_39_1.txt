Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  The chance of a randomly chosen person in the city being 185cm or taller is 15% (or 0.15). This is our starting point.
* **Witness Reliability:**  The witnesses aren't perfect. We need to factor in their accuracy rates to adjust our initial probability.
    * Witness 1: Correctly identifies height 80% of the time.
    * Witness 2: Correctly identifies height 70% of the time.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this scenario. It helps calculate updated probabilities (posterior probabilities) based on new evidence.

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B1 = Event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B2 = Event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* Witness 1's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem (Simplified for this case):**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1) 

Where:

* P(B1|A) = Probability Witness 1 says "185cm or taller" *given* the attacker actually is that tall (This is their accuracy rate = 0.8)
* P(A) = Prior probability of someone being 185cm or taller (0.15)
* P(B1) = Overall probability of Witness 1 saying "185cm or taller" (This needs further calculation)

**Calculating P(B1):**

Witness 1 can say "185cm or taller" in two ways:

1. Attacker *is* tall, and Witness 1 is correct: P(A) * P(B1|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. Attacker *is not* tall, but Witness 1 is wrong: P(not A) * P(B1|not A) = 0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17 

So, P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Final Calculation**

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185cm or taller.
