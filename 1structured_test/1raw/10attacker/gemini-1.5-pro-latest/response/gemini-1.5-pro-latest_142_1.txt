Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

* Let A be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let B1 be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let B2 be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities**

* P(A) = 0.15 (from the given information about the city's population)
* P(¬A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85 (¬A represents "not A", meaning the attacker is shorter than 185cm)

**3. Likelihoods**

* P(B1|A) = 0.80 (The probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185cm or taller)
* P(B1|¬A) = 0.20 (The probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185cm as being taller)
* P(B2|A) = 0.20 (The probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185cm or taller as being shorter)
* P(B2|¬A) = 0.70 (The probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185cm)

**4. Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find P(A|B1, B2), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given both witness testimonies.  We can use Bayes' Theorem, but since we have two pieces of evidence, we'll apply it in two steps:

* **Step 1: Update the prior with the first witness's testimony.**
   P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1) 
   Where P(B1) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   P(B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] + [P(B1|¬A) * P(¬A)]

* **Step 2: Update the posterior from step 1 with the second witness's testimony.**
   P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B2|A, B1) * P(A|B1)] / P(B2|B1)
   Assuming the witnesses' judgments are independent given the attacker's actual height (i.e., knowing one witness's judgment doesn't tell us anything about the other's accuracy beyond what we already know from their individual reliability), we have:
   P(B2|A, B1) = P(B2|A) 
   P(B2|B1) can be calculated similarly to P(B1) using the law of total probability and the updated probabilities from Step 1.

**5. Calculations**

* **Step 1:**
    * P(B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
    * P(A|B1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

* **Step 2:**
    * P(B2|B1) = (0.20 * 0.414) + (0.70 * (1 - 0.414)) ≈ 0.493
    * P(A|B1, B2) = (0.20 * 0.414) / 0.493 ≈ 0.168

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.168}

**Conclusion:**

Considering both witness testimonies and their reliability, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 16.8%. The conflicting testimonies, particularly the higher reliability of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter, significantly reduce the initial probability based solely on the city's height distribution.
