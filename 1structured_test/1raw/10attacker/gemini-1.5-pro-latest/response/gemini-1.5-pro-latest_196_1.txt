Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:**  The information about the city's population gives us a prior probability. There's a 15% chance someone in the city is 185cm or taller.
* **Witness Reliability:** The witnesses aren't perfectly reliable. We have their accuracy rates, which we'll use to update our prior probability.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this scenario. It helps us calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given new evidence (witness testimonies).

Let:

*  A = Event that the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B1 = Event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller
*  B2 = Event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm

We want to find P(A|B1), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1)

Where:

* P(B1|A) = Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller GIVEN the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (This is his accuracy rate of 80% or 0.8)
* P(A) = Prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (This is 15% or 0.15)
* P(B1) = Probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185cm or taller (This needs further calculation)

**Calculating P(B1)**

To get P(B1), we need to consider both scenarios:

1. **Attacker IS 185cm or taller, and the witness is correct:**  P(A) * P(B1|A) = 0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12
2. **Attacker IS NOT 185cm or taller, and the witness is incorrect:** P(~A) * P(B1|~A) = 0.85 * 0.3 = 0.255 

P(B1) = 0.12 + 0.255 = 0.375

**Final Calculation**

Now we have everything to apply Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.375 = 0.32

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.32} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimonies and the population information, the probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 32%.
