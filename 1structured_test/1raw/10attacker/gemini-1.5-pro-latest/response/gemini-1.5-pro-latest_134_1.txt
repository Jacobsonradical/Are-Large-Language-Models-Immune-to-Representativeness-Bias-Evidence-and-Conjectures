Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "B" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. State Prior Probabilities:**

* P(A) = 0.15 (from the given population data)
* P(~A) = 0.85 (complement of A, meaning the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. State Likelihoods (from witness reliability):**

* P(B|A) = 0.80 (The probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker IS taller)
* P(B|~A) = 0.20 (The probability the first witness says "taller" given the attacker IS NOT taller - this is their error rate)

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B) - the probability the attacker is actually taller given the witness's testimony.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness saying "taller" regardless of the actual height, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculate:**

Now we have all the pieces to plug into Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) â‰ˆ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
