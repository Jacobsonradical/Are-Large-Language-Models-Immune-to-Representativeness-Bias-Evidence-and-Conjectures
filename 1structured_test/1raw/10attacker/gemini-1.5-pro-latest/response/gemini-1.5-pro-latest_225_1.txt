Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

* Let "T" be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "S" be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**2. Prior Probabilities:**

* From the city's height distribution: 
    * P(T) = 0.15 (prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller)
    * P(S) = 0.85 (prior probability of someone being shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Witness Reliabilities (Likelihoods):**

* P(W1|T) = 0.80 (probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually tall)
* P(W1|S) = 0.20 (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as tall, given they are actually short)
* P(W2|T) = 0.30 (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as short, given they are actually tall)
* P(W2|S) = 0.70 (probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as short, given they are actually short)

**4. Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T|W1, W2), the probability the attacker is tall given both witness statements.  Since it's complex to calculate this directly, we can use the concept of odds and update them separately for each witness:

* **Odds in favor of T initially:** P(T) / P(S) = 0.15 / 0.85 = 3/17

* **Updating odds with the first witness:** 
    * The likelihood ratio for the first witness is P(W1|T) / P(W1|S) = 0.80 / 0.20 = 4
    * Multiply the initial odds by the likelihood ratio: (3/17) * 4 = 12/17

* **Updating odds with the second witness:**
    * The likelihood ratio for the second witness is P(W2|T) / P(W2|S) = 0.30 / 0.70 = 3/7
    * Multiply the updated odds by this likelihood ratio: (12/17) * (3/7) = 36/119

* **Converting back to probability:**
    * Odds of 36/119 mean P(T) / P(S) = 36/119
    *  P(T) = (36 / (36+119)) â‰ˆ 0.23 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.23} 

**Therefore, given both witness statements and their reliabilities, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.23.**
