Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into steps:

**1. Define the Events**

* Let "T" be the event that the attacker is truly 185cm or taller.
* Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let "W2" be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm. 

**2. State What We Know (from the provided information)**

* **Prior Probability:** P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **Witness 1 Accuracy:** 
    * P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **Witness 2 Accuracy:**
    * P(W2 | not T) = 0.70 (Witness 2 correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)

**3.  What We Want to Find**

* We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker is truly tall given that witness 1 said so.

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a way to update our belief about an event based on new evidence:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), the probability that witness 1 would claim the attacker is tall, we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] + [P(W1 | not T) * P(not T)]

**5. Calculate the Missing Pieces**

* P(not T) = 1 - P(T) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)
* P(W1 | not T) = 1 - P(W1 | T) = 0.20 (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter people 20% of the time) 

**6.  Plug the Values into Bayes' Theorem**

* P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29
* P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller is approximately 41.4%.**
