Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

We can use Bayes' theorem:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller GIVEN the attacker is actually 185cm or taller.  This is the witness's accuracy rate for this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller. This is the population distribution given, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). This can be calculated using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * Where ~A represents the attacker being shorter than 185cm.
    * We know P(B|A) = 0.8 and P(A) = 0.15
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness claims the attacker is tall when they are actually short (false positive). This is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

**Now we can calculate:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, we can plug everything into Bayes' theorem:**

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness's testimony and the population distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
