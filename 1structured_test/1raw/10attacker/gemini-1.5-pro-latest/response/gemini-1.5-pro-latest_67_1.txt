Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

**We know the following:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller (This is the witness's accuracy for this height group) = 0.8 
* **P(B|¬A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm (This is the witness's error rate for this height group) = 0.2
* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city = 0.15
* **P(¬A):** The prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185 cm in the city = 0.85

**Now we can apply Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Finally, plugging everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 ≈ 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
