Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

*  Let "T" be the event that the attacker is truly 185 cm or taller.
*  Let "S" be the event that the attacker is truly shorter than 185 cm.
*  Let "W1" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**2. Prior Probabilities (from information "b"):**

* P(T) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* P(S) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

**3. Likelihoods (from information "a"):**

* P(W1 | T) = 0.80 (The first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* P(W1 | S) = 0.20 (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)

**4. Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(T | W1), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(T | W1) = [P(W1 | T) * P(T)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), the probability of the witness claiming "tall", we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) =  P(W1 | T) * P(T) + P(W1 | S) * P(S)
P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

**5. Calculation:**

Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:

P(T | W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(T | W1) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and population information, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller. It's important to note that this is still far from certain, highlighting the limitations of eyewitness testimony.
