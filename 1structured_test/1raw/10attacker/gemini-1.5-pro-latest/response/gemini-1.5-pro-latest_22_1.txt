Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. This is the witness's accuracy rate for this height group, which is 80% or 0.8.

* **P(A):** The prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller. This is based on the city's height distribution, which is 15% or 0.15.

* **P(B):** The probability of the witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller (regardless of the attacker's actual height). We can calculate this using the law of total probability: 
    * P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A)  +  P(B|~A) * P(~A)
    * Where ~A is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185cm
    * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness claims the attacker is tall when they are actually short (false positive), which is 20% or 0.2.
    * P(~A) is the probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm, or 85% (0.85). 

**Calculations**

1. **Calculate P(B):**
   * P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Despite the witness's relatively good accuracy, the low prior probability of someone being 185 cm or taller in the city means that the probability of the attacker actually being that tall, given the witness's testimony, is only around 41.4%.
