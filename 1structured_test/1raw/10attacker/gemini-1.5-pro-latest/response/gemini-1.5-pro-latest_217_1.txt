Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

*  **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
*  **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
*  **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
*  **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are asked to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker was 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**We know the following:**

* **Prior probabilities:**
    * P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
    * P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185cm)
* **Witness reliability (likelihoods):**
    * P(W1|A) = 0.80 (First witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
    * P(W1|B) = 0.20 (First witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 
    * P(W2|A) = 0.30 (Second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)
    * P(W2|B) = 0.70 (Second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we can use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

**Calculations:**

1. **P(W1):** 
   P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|W1):**
   P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
