Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185cm+ given the attacker is actually 185cm+)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm+ given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.20** (Probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm given the attacker is actually 185cm+) 
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185cm given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)

**We want to find: P(A|W1, W2)** (Probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies)

**Using Bayes' Theorem and the fact that the witnesses' judgments are likely independent given the actual height of the attacker:**

P(A|W1, W2) = [P(W1, W2|A) * P(A)] / P(W1, W2)

We can expand the denominator using the law of total probability:

P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A) * P(A) + P(W1, W2|B) * P(B)

And we can express the joint probabilities of the witness testimonies given the attacker's height using the assumption of conditional independence:

P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) * P(W2|A)
P(W1, W2|B) = P(W1|B) * P(W2|B)

**Now, we can plug in all the given values:**

P(W1, W2|A) = 0.80 * 0.20 = 0.16
P(W1, W2|B) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
P(W1, W2) = (0.16 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.143

Finally:

P(A|W1, W2) = (0.16 * 0.15) / 0.143 = 0.168 

**{probability: 0.168}**

**Therefore, given both witness testimonies, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.168 or 16.8%.**
