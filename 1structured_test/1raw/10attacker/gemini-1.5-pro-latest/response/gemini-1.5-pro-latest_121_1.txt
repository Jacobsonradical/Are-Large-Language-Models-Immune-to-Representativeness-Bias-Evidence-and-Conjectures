Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayes' Theorem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to update our prior belief about the attacker's height (based on the city's population) with the new evidence from the witnesses. 

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the city population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability: 85% of the city population is shorter than 185 cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time) 

**We want to find: P(A|W1) ** (The probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's testimony)

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]
P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

Now we can calculate P(A|W1):

P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.4138} 

**Therefore, given the first witness's testimony, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.4138 or 41.38%.**
