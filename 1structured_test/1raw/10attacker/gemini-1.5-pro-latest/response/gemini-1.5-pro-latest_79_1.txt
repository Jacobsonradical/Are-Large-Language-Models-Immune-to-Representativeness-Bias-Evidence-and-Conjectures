Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (This is the witness's accuracy when the attacker is tall: 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller (This is the population percentage: 15% or 0.15). 
* **P(B):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller (This needs to be calculated considering both scenarios: the attacker is tall and the attacker is short).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

P(B) =  P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|~A) * P(~A)

Where:
* **P(B|~A):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller, *given* the attacker is actually *shorter* than 185cm (This is the witness's error rate when the attacker is short: 20% or 0.2).
* **P(~A):** The prior probability of the attacker being *shorter* than 185cm (This is the remaining population percentage: 85% or 0.85).

**Plugging in the numbers:**

* P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|B):**

* P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
