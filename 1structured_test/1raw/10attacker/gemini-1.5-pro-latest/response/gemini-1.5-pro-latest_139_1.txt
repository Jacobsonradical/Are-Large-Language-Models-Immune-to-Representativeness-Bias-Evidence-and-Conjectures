Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** We know from the city's population data that there's a 15% chance a randomly selected person is 185cm or taller. This is our prior probability.
* **Witness Testimony:** We have two witnesses with different accuracies. We need to use their accuracy rates to update our prior probability.

**Using Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has happened.
* P(A): Prior probability of event A.
* P(B): Prior probability of event B.

**Applying Bayes' to Our Problem**

Let's define:

* Event A: The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.

* P(A): 0.15 (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* P(B|A): 0.80 (Accuracy of the first witness when someone is actually 185cm or taller)
* P(B): This is where it gets trickier. We need the probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height.  We can calculate this using the law of total probability:
    * P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A)  + P(B|~A) * P(~A) 
    * Where ~A means "attacker is shorter than 185cm"
    * P(B|~A) = 0.20 (The first witness has a 20% chance of incorrectly saying someone is taller when they are actually shorter)
    * P(~A) = 0.85 (The probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)

**Calculation**

1. **Calculate P(B):** 
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **Calculate P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.
