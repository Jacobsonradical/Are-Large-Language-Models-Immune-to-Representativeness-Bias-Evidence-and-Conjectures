Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is correct about height.
* **Base Rate:** We know the general height distribution in the city.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate conditional probability (the probability of an event happening given that another event has already occurred).  In our case:

* **Event A:** The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find **P(A|B)** - the probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the first witness said so.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break it down:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness says "tall" *given* the attacker *is* tall (80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (the base rate - 15% or 0.15).
* **P(B):** The probability the witness says "tall" (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is tall and they're right, OR the attacker is short and they're wrong).

**Calculating P(B):**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

   * P(B|~A): Probability the witness says "tall" given the attacker is *short* (20% or 0.2, since they're wrong 20% of the time about tall people).
   * P(~A): Probability the attacker is *short* (85% or 0.85).

P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it Back Together:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion:**

Even though the first witness claimed the attacker was tall, the probability of the attacker actually being 185 cm or taller is about 41.4%. This is because the base rate of tall people in the city is relatively low.
