Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:**  We know how often each witness is correct about height, which is essential for weighing their testimonies.
* **Base Rate:** The city's height distribution is crucial. It tells us the general likelihood of someone being 185cm or taller, even before considering witness statements.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem is perfect for this situation. It helps calculate the probability of an event (attacker being 185cm or taller) given prior knowledge (city's height distribution) and new evidence (witness testimonies).

Let's define:

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given witness 1's statement.

**Bayes' Theorem states:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* **P(B|A):** Probability witness 1 claims 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller (Witness 1's accuracy when the attacker is tall: 80% or 0.8)
* **P(A):** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller (base rate: 15% or 0.15)
* **P(B):** Probability of witness 1 claiming 185cm or taller (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is actually tall and the witness is correct, or the attacker is shorter and the witness is wrong).

**Calculating P(B)**

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]

* P(B| not A): Probability witness 1 claims 185cm or taller given the attacker is shorter (Witness 1's error rate when the attacker is shorter: 20% or 0.2)
* P(not A): Probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm (1 - 0.15 = 0.85)

Therefore:
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Putting it all together**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Conclusion**

Even though witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185cm or taller, considering the witness's accuracy and the city's height distribution, the probability of the attacker actually being that tall is around 41.4%.
