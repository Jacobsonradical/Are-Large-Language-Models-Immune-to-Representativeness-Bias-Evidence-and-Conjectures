Here's how we can approach this problem:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to use Bayesian reasoning to update our prior belief about the attacker's height (based on population data) with the witness testimonies.

**Let's define some terms:**

* **Event A:** The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
* **Event B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
* **P(B|A) = 0.80** (Witness 1 accuracy: If the attacker is tall, there's an 80% chance the witness will say so)
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20** (Witness 1 error rate: If the attacker is not tall, there's a 20% chance the witness will still say they are tall)

**We want to find:**

* **P(A|B)** (Posterior probability: The probability the attacker is tall given that the first witness said so)

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To calculate the denominator, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
```

**Calculations:**

1. **P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.85** 
2. **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29**
3. **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population data, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
