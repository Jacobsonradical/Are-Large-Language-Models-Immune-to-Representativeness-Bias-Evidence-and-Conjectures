Here's how to approach this problem, breaking it down into parts:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to determine the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller given two pieces of evidence:

* **Witness Testimonies:**  Their accuracy in judging height.
* **Population Distribution:**  The percentage of people in the city who are actually 185cm or taller.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

This problem is best solved using Bayes' Theorem, which helps calculate conditional probability:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B): Probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened.
* P(B|A): Probability of event B happening given that event A has already happened.
* P(A): Probability of event A happening.
* P(B): Probability of event B happening.

**Let's Define Our Events**

* Event A: Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We need to find: P(A|B)** - The probability the attacker is actually 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**Calculating the Components**

1. **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness would say the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller.  This is the witness's accuracy rate for this scenario, which is 80% or 0.8.

2. **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller based on the city's population distribution. This is 15% or 0.15.

3. **P(B):** The probability the first witness would claim the attacker is 185cm or taller (regardless of the actual height). We need to consider both scenarios:
    * The attacker *is* 185cm or taller, and the witness is correct (0.15 * 0.8 = 0.12).
    * The attacker is *shorter* than 185cm, and the witness is incorrect (0.85 * 0.2 = 0.17).
    * P(B) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29

**Putting it Together**

Now we have all the pieces for Bayes' Theorem:

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
          = 0.414 (approximately)

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Important Note:** This calculation assumes the witnesses' testimonies are independent of each other.  In reality, there might be other factors influencing their judgment.
