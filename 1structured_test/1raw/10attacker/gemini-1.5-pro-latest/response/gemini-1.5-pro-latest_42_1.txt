Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events**

* Let **A** be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let **B1** be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let **B2** be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm (since this is the opposite of what the first witness claimed).

**2. State Probabilities**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller, based on city population)
* **P(~A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B1|A) = 0.8** (Probability of the first witness saying "taller" given the attacker IS taller)
* **P(B1|~A) = 0.2** (Probability of the first witness saying "taller" given the attacker IS NOT taller)
* **P(B2|A) = 0.3** (Probability of the second witness saying "shorter" given the attacker IS taller)
* **P(B2|~A) = 0.7** (Probability of the second witness saying "shorter" given the attacker IS NOT taller)

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem**

We want to find **P(A|B1, B2)**, the probability the attacker is taller given both witness statements.  Since it's difficult to directly calculate the probability of both witnesses making their statements together, we can approach it by considering each witness's statement as updating the prior probability.

* **After the first witness:** We can calculate P(A|B1) using Bayes' theorem: 
   *  P(A|B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] / P(B1) 
   *  Where P(B1) can be calculated using the law of total probability: P(B1) = [P(B1|A) * P(A)] + [P(B1|~A) * P(~A)]

* **After the second witness:** We further update the probability using the second witness's statement. Now our prior becomes P(A|B1), the updated probability after the first witness.
   * P(A|B1, B2) = [P(B2|A, B1) * P(A|B1)] / P(B2|B1)
   * We can assume that given the attacker's actual height, the witnesses' testimonies are independent (one witness's accuracy doesn't influence the other). Therefore, P(B2|A, B1) = P(B2|A) and P(B2|~A, B1) = P(B2|~A).
   * Similar to before, calculate P(B2|B1) using the law of total probability, but with P(A|B1) and P(~A|B1)

**4. Calculate**

Let's plug in the numbers and calculate:

* **Calculating P(B1):**
   * P(B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

* **Calculating P(A|B1):**
   * P(A|B1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

* **Calculating P(B2|B1):**
   * P(B2|B1) = (0.3 * 0.414) + (0.7 * (1 - 0.414)) = 0.537

* **Calculating P(A|B1, B2):**
   * P(A|B1, B2) = (0.3 * 0.414) / 0.537 = 0.231

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.231}

Therefore, considering both witness statements and the city's population statistics, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately **0.231**.
