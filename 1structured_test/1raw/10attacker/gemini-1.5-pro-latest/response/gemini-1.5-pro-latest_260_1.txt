Here's how to break down this probability problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Witness Reliability:** We know how often each witness is accurate about height. 
* **Base Rate:**  We know the general height distribution in the city, which is crucial information.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem helps calculate conditional probabilities â€“ the probability of something happening given that something else has already occurred.  Here's how it applies:

Let:

* Event A: The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
* Event B: The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually tall *given* the first witness said so.

Bayes' Theorem states: 
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Let's break down each term:

* **P(B|A):** The probability the witness would say the attacker is tall *given* the attacker is actually tall (witness's accuracy when the attacker is tall) = 0.8 
* **P(A):** The prior probability of the attacker being tall (based on the city's height distribution) = 0.15
* **P(B):** The probability of the witness saying the attacker is tall (this can happen in two ways: the attacker is tall and the witness is right, OR the attacker is short and the witness is wrong).

To calculate P(B), we use the law of total probability:
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)] 
   * P(B|~A) is the probability the witness says "tall" when the attacker is short (witness's error rate) = 0.2
   * P(~A) is the probability the attacker is *not* tall = 0.85

Now we can plug everything into Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Calculate P(B):**  (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29
2. **Calculate P(A|B):** (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Conclusion**

Even though the first witness claimed the attacker was tall, there's only about a 41.4% probability the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller. The relatively high percentage of shorter people in the city significantly influences the final probability.
