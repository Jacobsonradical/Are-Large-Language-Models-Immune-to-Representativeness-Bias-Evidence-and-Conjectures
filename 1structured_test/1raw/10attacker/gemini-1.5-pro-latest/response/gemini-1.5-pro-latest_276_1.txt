Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker is shorter than 185cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185cm.

**We are given:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of attacker being 185cm or taller)
* **P(B) = 0.85** (Prior probability of attacker being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W1|A) = 0.80** (Probability of the first witness claiming "185cm or taller" given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(W1|B) = 0.20** (Probability of the first witness claiming "185cm or taller" given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)
* **P(W2|A) = 0.20** (Probability of the second witness claiming "shorter than 185cm" given the attacker is actually 185cm or taller)
* **P(W2|B) = 0.70** (Probability of the second witness claiming "shorter than 185cm" given the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm)

**We want to find P(A|W1),** the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1)

To find P(W1), we use the law of total probability:

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

**Calculating:**

1. **P(W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 

2. **P(A|W1) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414**

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.**

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414}
