Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define some terms:**

* **A:** The event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's claim.**

**We know the following:**

* **P(A) = 0.15** (Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller)
* **P(¬A) = 0.85** (Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm)
* **P(B|A) = 0.8** (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller)
* **P(B|¬A) = 0.2** (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185cm as being taller) 

**We can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability of the witness claiming someone is taller, we use the law of total probability:

P(B) =  [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|¬A) * P(¬A)]
P(B) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can plug everything back into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|B) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 
P(A|B) ≈ 0.414

**Answer:** {probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the city's height distribution, there is approximately a 41.4% probability that the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
