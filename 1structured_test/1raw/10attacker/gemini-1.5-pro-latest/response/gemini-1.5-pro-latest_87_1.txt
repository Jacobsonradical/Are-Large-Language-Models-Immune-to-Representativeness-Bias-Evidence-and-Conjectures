Here's how to approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define the Events:**

* Let "A" be the event that the attacker is 185cm or taller.
* Let "B" be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**2. State the Given Probabilities:**

* **Prior Probability (from population data):** P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185cm or taller)
* **Witness 1 Accuracy:** 
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 (Probability the witness says "taller" given the attacker *is* taller)
    * P(B'|A) = 0.20 (Probability the witness says "shorter" given the attacker *is* taller)
* **We lack direct information about the second witness's accuracy regarding taller/shorter when the attacker is actually shorter. This information is not directly relevant for calculating P(A|B).**

**3. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find P(A|B), the probability the attacker is actually taller given the first witness's claim. Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To find P(B), the probability the witness claims "taller" (regardless of actual height), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|A') * P(A')]

Where:

* P(B|A') is the probability the witness says "taller" given the attacker is *shorter*.  We don't know this value directly, but it's the complement of their accuracy for identifying shorter people: P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') 
* P(A') = 0.85 (Probability the attacker is shorter than 185cm)

**4. Calculate:**

* P(B|A') = 1 - P(B'|A') = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
* P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.80 * 0.85) = 0.80 
* P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.80 = 0.15

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.15}

**Conclusion:**

Despite the witness testimony, the probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller remains the same as the general population proportion. This is because the witness's accuracy rate (80%) is offset by the fact that taller people are less common in the population (15%).
