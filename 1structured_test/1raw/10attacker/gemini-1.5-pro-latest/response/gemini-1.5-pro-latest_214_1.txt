Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**Let's define the events:**

* **A:** The attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
* **B:** The attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
* **W1:** The first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
* **W2:** The second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

**We are asked to find P(A|W1), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's testimony.**

**Here's how we can use Bayes' Theorem:**

P(A|W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)] / P(W1) 

Where:

* **P(W1|A):** Probability the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker was actually 185 cm or taller (This is the witness's accuracy for this scenario: 80% or 0.8).
* **P(A):** Prior probability of an attacker being 185 cm or taller in the city (Given as 15% or 0.15).
* **P(W1):** Total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller (This can happen in two ways: the attacker was actually tall and the witness got it right, or the attacker was shorter and the witness got it wrong).

**Calculating P(W1):**

P(W1) = [P(W1|A) * P(A)]  + [P(W1|B) * P(B)]

* **P(W1|B):** Probability the first witness would claim the attacker was 185 cm or taller *given* the attacker was actually shorter than 185cm (This is the witness's error rate for this scenario: 20% or 0.2).
* **P(B):** Prior probability of an attacker being shorter than 185cm in the city (Given as 85% or 0.85).

**Plugging in the values:**

P(W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) + (0.2 * 0.85) = 0.29

**Now we can calculate P(A|W1):**

P(A|W1) = (0.8 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.4138 

**Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4138.**

**Answer: {probability: 0.4138}**
