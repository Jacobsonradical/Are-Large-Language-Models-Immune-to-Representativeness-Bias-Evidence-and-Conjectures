Here's how we can approach this problem using Bayesian reasoning:

**1. Define Events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**2. State Prior Probabilities:**

* **P(A):**  The prior probability of the attacker being 185cm or taller is 0.15 (given in the problem).
* **P(~A):** The prior probability of the attacker being shorter than 185cm is 0.85 (1 - 0.15).

**3. State Likelihoods:**

* **P(B|A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller is 0.80 (witness's accuracy).
* **P(B|~A):** The probability the first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the attacker is actually shorter than 185cm is 0.20 (witness's error rate).

**4. Apply Bayes' Theorem:**

We want to find **P(A|B)**, the probability the attacker is 185cm or taller *given* the first witness's claim.  Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

To calculate the denominator, P(B), we use the law of total probability:

P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B|~A) * P(~A)]

**5. Calculate:**

* **P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29** 
* **P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.414**

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414} 

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the population distribution, there's approximately a 41.4% probability the attacker was 185cm or taller.**
