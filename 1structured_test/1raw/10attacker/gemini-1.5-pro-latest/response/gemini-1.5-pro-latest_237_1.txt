Here's how to approach this problem:

**Understanding the Information**

* **Prior Probability:** The information about the city's population gives us the *prior probability* of a randomly selected person being 185cm or taller (15%).
* **Witness Reliability:**  The information about the witnesses gives us their accuracy rates. This is crucial for updating our prior belief based on their testimonies.

**Applying Bayes' Theorem**

Bayes' Theorem provides a framework for updating probabilities based on new evidence:

P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)

Where:

* P(A|B):  The probability of event A happening given that event B has already happened. In our case: The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller (A) *given* the witness testimonies (B).
* P(B|A): The probability of observing the evidence (B) given the event (A) is true. 
* P(A): The prior probability of event A (attacker being 185cm or taller).
* P(B): The probability of observing the evidence (B) regardless of whether A is true or not.

**Calculations**

Let's break down the calculation:

* **Event A:** Attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **Event B:** Witness 1 says "taller", Witness 2 says "shorter".

* **P(A):** 0.15 (prior probability from population data)
* **P(B|A):**  The probability of the witnesses giving their specific testimonies *if* the attacker is actually 185cm or taller.
    * Witness 1 would be correct (80% accuracy)
    * Witness 2 would be incorrect (30% error rate)
    * P(B|A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24 

* **P(B):** This is the probability of getting those witness testimonies regardless of the attacker's actual height.  We need to consider both scenarios (attacker taller and attacker shorter) and sum the probabilities:
    * **Scenario 1: Attacker is taller:** We just calculated this (0.24)
    * **Scenario 2: Attacker is shorter:**
        * Witness 1 would be incorrect (20% error rate)
        * Witness 2 would be correct (70% accuracy)
        * Probability of this scenario: 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
    * **P(B) = 0.24 (Scenario 1) + 0.14 (Scenario 2) = 0.38**

**Putting it all together in Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Attacker is taller | Witness testimonies) = (0.24 * 0.15) / 0.38 = 0.095

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.095}

**Conclusion:**

Despite one witness claiming the attacker was taller, the probability of the attacker actually being 185cm or taller is only about 9.5%. This is because the prior probability of a person in the city being that height is low, and the witness testimonies have some degree of uncertainty.
