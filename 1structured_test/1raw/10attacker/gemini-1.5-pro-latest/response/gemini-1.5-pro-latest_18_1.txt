Here's how we can estimate the probability:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller *given* that the first witness claimed so.  This means we're dealing with conditional probability and potentially Bayes' Theorem.

**Let's define some events:**

* **A:** The attacker is 185cm or taller.
* **B:** The first witness claims the attacker is 185cm or taller.

**We want to find P(A|B):** The probability the attacker is 185cm or taller given the first witness's statement.

**Information we have:**

* **P(A) = 0.15:** Prior probability of someone in the city being 185cm or taller.
* **P(B|A) = 0.80:**  Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185cm or taller (sensitivity).
* **P(B| not A) = 0.20:** Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185cm or taller when they are shorter (false positive rate). This is derived from the witness's 20% error rate.
* **P(not A) = 0.85:** Prior probability of someone in the city being shorter than 185cm. 

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**

```
P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B) 
```

To find P(B), the probability of the first witness claiming someone is 185cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

```
P(B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] + [P(B| not A) * P(not A)]
```

**Calculations:**

1. **P(B):** 
   * P(B) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.29

2. **P(A|B):**
   * P(A|B) = (0.80 * 0.15) / 0.29 = 0.414 

**Answer:**

{probability: 0.414}

**Therefore, given the witness testimony and the base rate of height in the population, the probability that the attacker was actually 185cm or taller is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.**
