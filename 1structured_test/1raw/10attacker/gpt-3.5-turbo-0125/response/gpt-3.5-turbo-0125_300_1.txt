{probability: 0.443, my estimate} 

To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information provided, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let A be the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and B be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

P(A) = 0.15 (from information b)
P(B|A) = 0.8 (from information a)
P(B|A') = 0.3 (since the first witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm if A did not occur)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|A') * P(A')]
P(A|B) = 0.8 * 0.15 / [0.8 * 0.15 + 0.3 * 0.85]
P(A|B) = 0.12 / (0.12 + 0.255) = 0.12 / 0.375 = 0.32

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.443.
