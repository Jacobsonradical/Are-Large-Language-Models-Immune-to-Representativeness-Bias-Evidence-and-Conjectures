To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. We'll define:

- \(H\) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg H\) as the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness (W1) says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and they are correct 80% of the time if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and wrong 20% of the time if the attacker is shorter. Thus:
- \(P(W1 | H) = 0.80\)
- \(P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.20\)

The second witness (W2) says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and they are correct 70% of the time if the attacker is indeed shorter, and wrong 30% of the time if the attacker is taller. Thus:
- \(P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.70\)
- \(P(W2 | H) = 0.30\)

We are interested in \(P(H | W1, \neg W2)\), where \(\neg W2\) means the testimony of W2 is against H. Using Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability:

\[
P(H | W1, \neg W2) = \frac{P(W1, \neg W2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1, \neg W2)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W1, \neg W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \cdot P(\neg W2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(W1, \neg W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg W2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14
\]

\[
P(W1, \neg W2) = P(W1, \neg W2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, \neg W2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H | W1, \neg W2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, considering both testimonies, is approximately \(0.2323\), which can be rounded to \(0.23\).
