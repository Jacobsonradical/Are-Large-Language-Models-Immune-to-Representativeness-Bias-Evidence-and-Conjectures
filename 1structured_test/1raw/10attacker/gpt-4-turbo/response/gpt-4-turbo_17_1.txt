To tackle this question, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we need to update the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event where the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event where the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
  
According to the given information:
- The first witness, \( W_1 \), is correct 80% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller and erroneous 20% of the time if the person is shorter than that:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
  
- The second witness, \( W_2 \), is correct 70% of the time if the person is shorter than 185 cm and erroneous 30% of the time if the person is 185 cm or taller:
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

From Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of \( H \) knowing both \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) is:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness reports, is approximately 0.2323.
