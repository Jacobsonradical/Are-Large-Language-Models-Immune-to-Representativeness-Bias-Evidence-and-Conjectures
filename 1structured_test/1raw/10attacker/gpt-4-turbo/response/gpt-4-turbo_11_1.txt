To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' reports, we apply Bayesian analysis.

Let:
- \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_0 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_0) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)

Let \( E_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 testifies the height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( E_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 testifies the height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information, the accuracy of the witnesses is:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so:
  - \( P(E_1 | H_1) = 0.80 \) (probability of Witness 1 saying 185 cm or taller given that it is true)
  - \( P(E_1 | H_0) = 0.20 \) (probability of Witness 1 saying 185 cm or taller given that it is false)
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so:
  - \( P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.30 \) (probability of Witness 2 saying shorter than 185 cm given that it is false)
  - \( P(E_2 | H_0) = 0.70 \) (probability of Witness 2 saying shorter than 185 cm given that it is true)

We are interested in \( P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims. Using Bayes' theorem and assuming independence between witnesses:

\[
P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) \times P(H_1)}{P(E_1, E_2)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) = P(E_1 | H_1) \times P(E_2 | H_1) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E_1, E_2 | H_0) = P(E_1 | H_0) \times P(E_2 | H_0) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

The total probability \( P(E_1, E_2) \) is:
\[
P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H_1) \times P(H_1) + P(E_1, E_2 | H_0) \times P(H_0)
            = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
            = 0.036 + 0.119
            = 0.155
\]

Thus, 
\[
P(H_1 | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conditions and witness accuracy, is about 0.232.
