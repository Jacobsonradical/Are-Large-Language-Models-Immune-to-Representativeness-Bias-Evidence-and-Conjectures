To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the varying witness reliability and the proportion of taller and shorter individuals in the population, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the claims of witnesses 1 and 2 respectively, where \( W_1 \) says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( W_2 \) says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

Bayes' Theorem states that:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' abilities are:
- Witness 1: Correct 80% (both for taller and shorter), thus:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \)
- Witness 2: Correct 70% (both for taller and shorter), thus:
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \)

By the law of total probability, \( P(W_1, W_2) \) can be computed as:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H)P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H)P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.232258 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the accounts of both witnesses, is approximately 0.232258.

Therefore, we can provide the result as:
{probability: 0.232258}
