To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us update our prior belief about a probability based on new evidence. In the given scenario:

1. Let \(H\) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \(W_1\) be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. Let \(W_2\) be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem's data:
- \( P(H) \), the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 85%, or 0.85.

Additionally, based on the witnesses' accuracies:
- \( P(W_1 | H) \), the probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) \), the probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not, is 20% or 0.2.

- \( P(W_2 | H) \), the probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are not, is 30% or 0.3.
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) \), the probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, is 70% or 0.7.

To figure out the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting claims of both witnesses, we first calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \), the overall likelihood witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) P(H)) + (P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H)) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]
  
Now, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232258 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering both witnesses' accounts, is approximately \(0.232\).
  
Therefore, the numerical answer in the requested format is \( \{ \text{probability}: 0.232 \} \).
