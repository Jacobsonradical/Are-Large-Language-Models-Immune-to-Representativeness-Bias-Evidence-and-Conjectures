To solve this question, we can use Bayesian probability to update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' statements.

Step 1: Define the prior probabilities based on initial information.
- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \] (Since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
\[ P(L) = 0.85 \] (Since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Step 2: Assess the likelihoods based on witnesses' statements.
- Witness 1 can correctly judge whether someone is ≥185 cm 80% of the time:
  \[ P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \] and \[ P(W_1|L) = 0.20 \]
- Witness 2 can correctly judge whether someone is <185 cm 70% of the time:
  \[ P(W_2|L) = 0.70 \] and \[ P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \]

Step 3: Witnesses provide conflicting statements:
- \( W_1 \): Attacker is ≥185 cm.
- \( W_2 \): Attacker is <185 cm.

Step 4: Calculate the joint probabilities of these statements with the events.
Using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | L) = P(W_1 | L) \times P(W_2 | L) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Step 5: Use Bayes' Rule to find the updated probability \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \).
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | L)P(L) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' statements is approximately:
{probability: 0.232}
