To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(\text{Taller} | \text{Evidence}) = \frac{P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Taller}) \times P(\text{Taller})}{P(\text{Evidence})} \]

Where:
- \( P(\text{Taller}) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\text{Shorter}) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)

The evidence includes the testimonies of two witnesses. We calculate \( P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Taller}) \) and \( P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Shorter}) \), then use these to find \( P(\text{Evidence}) \).

- First witness correct (80%) if attacker is taller and incorrect (20%) if shorter.
- Second witness correct (70%) if attacker is shorter and incorrect (30%) if taller.

Calculations:
\[ P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Taller}) = P(\text{First witness correct}) \times P(\text{Second witness incorrect}) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Shorter}) = P(\text{First witness incorrect}) \times P(\text{Second witness correct}) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(\text{Evidence}) = P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Taller}) \times P(\text{Taller}) + P(\text{Evidence} | \text{Shorter}) \times P(\text{Shorter}) \]
\[ P(\text{Evidence}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can find \( P(\text{Taller} | \text{Evidence}) \):
\[ P(\text{Taller} | \text{Evidence}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence, is approximately 0.2323.
