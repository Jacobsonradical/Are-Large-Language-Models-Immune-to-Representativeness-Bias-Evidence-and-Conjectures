To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we need to apply Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem calculates the probability of a condition based on other known probabilities. In this particular case, we would use it to adjust the initial probability (prior probability) based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( W_1 \) as the event "witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker"
- \( W_2 \) as the event "witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker"
- \( \bar{A} \) as the complement of \( A \) (i.e., "attacker is shorter than 185 cm")

From your information:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\bar{A}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Accuracy of witnesses:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (witness 1 identifies correctly 80% of the time when the person is tall)
- \( P(W_1 | \bar{A}) = 0.20 \) (witness 1 identifies correctly 20% of the time when the person is not tall, thus mistakenly identifying \( \bar{A} \) as \( A \))
- \( P(W_2 | \bar{A}) = 0.70 \) (witness 2 identifies correctly 70% of the time when the person is not tall)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (witness 2 identifies correctly 30% of the time when the person is tall, thus mistakenly identifying \( A \) as \( \bar{A} \))

To find \( P(A | W_1) \) ("probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claims so"):
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) P(A) + P(W_1 | \bar{A}) P(\bar{A}) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Substitute these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Answer:
```json
{ "probability": 0.4138 }
```
This means there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the claim of the first witness.
