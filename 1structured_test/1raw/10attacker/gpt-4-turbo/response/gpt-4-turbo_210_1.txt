To solve this question, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We need to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting reports from the two witnesses.

1. Define the variables:
   - Let \( T \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( S \) denote the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Let \( W_1 \) be the event the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - Let \( W_2 \) be the event the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Given probabilities:
   - \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

3. Witness accuracy:
   - First witness's accuracy: \( P(W_1|T) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1|S) = 0.2 \)
   - Second witness's accuracy: \( P(W_2|S) = 0.7 \), \( P(W_2|T) = 0.3 \)

4. We want to find \( P(T|W_1, W_2) \), i.e. the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witnesses reports.

5. Use the Law of Total Probability for evidence from both witnesses:
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|T)P(T) + P(W_1, W_2|S)P(S)
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2|T) = P(W_1|T)P(W_2|T) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2|S) = P(W_1|S)P(W_2|S) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

6. Now use Bayes' Theorem:
   \[
   P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|T) P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
   \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness statements is approximately 0.2323.

{"probability": 0.2323}
