To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting accounts of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps us to update our prior belief about a hypothesis based upon new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{H} \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( E_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifying taller individuals)
- \( P(E_1 | \overline{H}) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifying shorter individuals as taller)
- \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifying taller individuals as shorter)
- \( P(E_2 | \overline{H}) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifying shorter individuals)

We are looking to find \( P(H | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H)P(H) + P(E_1 | \overline{H})P(\overline{H}) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
