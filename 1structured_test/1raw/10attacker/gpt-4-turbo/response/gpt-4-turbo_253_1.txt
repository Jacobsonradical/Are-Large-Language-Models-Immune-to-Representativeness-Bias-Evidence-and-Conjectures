To solve this question, we need to use Bayesian probability to combine the witness credibility, the attacker's height information, and the general population height distribution. This approach allows us to update our probability estimate given new evidence.

Let:
- \(H\) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_1\) and \(W_2\) denote the events that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

Given data:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H^c) = 0.85\) (85% of the population are shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time (\(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8\) and \(P(W_1^c | H^c) = 0.8\))
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time (\(P(W_2^c | H) = 0.7\) and \(P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7\))

From this, we can derive:
- \(P(W_1 | H^c) = 1 - P(W_1^c | H^c) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2\) 
- \(P(W_2^c | H^c) = 1 - P(W_2 | H^c) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3\)

Since Witness 1 and Witness 2 provided opposite accounts of the attacker's height, we use:
- \(P(W_1 \cap W_2)\) to denote the case where Witness 1 sees the attacker as taller and Witness 2 sees the attacker as shorter.

Using the law of total probability, we can calculate \(P(W_1 \cap W_2)\) as:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2^c | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Next, we use Bayes' theorem to find \(P(H | W_1 \cap W_2)\):
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately \(0.23\).
