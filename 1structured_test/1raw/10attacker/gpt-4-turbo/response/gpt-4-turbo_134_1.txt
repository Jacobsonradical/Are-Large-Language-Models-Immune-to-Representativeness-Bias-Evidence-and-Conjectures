To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness statements and their respective accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - **\( P(T) \) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15**
   - **\( P(T^c) \) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85**
   - **\( P(W_1 | T) \) = Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8**
   - **\( P(W_1 | T^c) \) = Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 20% = 0.2** (since they err in 20% of cases when the person is shorter)
   - **\( P(W_2 | T) \) = Probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 30% = 0.3** 
   - **\( P(W_2 | T^c) \) = Probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 70% = 0.7**

2. **Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, we find:**
   \[
   P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | T) \times P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
   \]
   where:
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | T) = P(W_1 | T) \times P(W_2 | T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2 | T^c) = P(W_1 | T^c) \times P(W_2 | T^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
   \]

   **Calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \) (total probability law):**
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = (P(W_1, W_2 | T) \times P(T)) + (P(W_1, W_2 | T^c) \times P(T^c))
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

3. **Now calculate \( P(T | W_1, W_2) \):**
   \[
   P(T | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} â‰ˆ 0.232
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the witness statements and population statistics, is approximately 0.232.
