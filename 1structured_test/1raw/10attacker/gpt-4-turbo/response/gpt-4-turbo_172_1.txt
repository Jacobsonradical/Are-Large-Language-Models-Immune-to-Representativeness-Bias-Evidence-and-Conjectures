To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimony of the witnesses and the known population statistics. We'll use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \(H\) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H\) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\) as the event that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) as the event that Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 mistakenly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when they are not)
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Given that Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller (\(W_1\)) and Witness 2 said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (\( \neg W_2\)), we want to find \( P(H \mid W_1 \cap \neg W_2)\).

Using Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid H)P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H)P(\neg W_2 \mid H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H)P(\neg W_2 \mid \neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} \]
\[ P(H \mid W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately: 
{probability: 0.622}
