To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the claims of the witnesses and their reliability, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

Bayes' Theorem is given by:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis ("attacker is 185 cm or taller"),
- \( E \) is the evidence ("what the witnesses claim"),
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (before considering the witnesses' claims),
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of \( E \) given \( H \),
- \( P(E) \) normalizes the probability and is \( P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \).

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm).

For the witnesses:
- Witness 1 accuracy for \( H \) is 80%: \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- Witness 1 accuracy for \( \neg H \) is 20% (wrong): \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \)
- Witness 2 accuracy for \( \neg H \) is 70%: \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \)
- Witness 2 accuracy for \( H \) is 30% (wrong): \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \)

The overall evidence \( E \) combines the claims of both witnesses. Here, we look for all scenarios: 
1. Witness 1 says \( H \) (185 cm or taller) and Witness 2 says \( \neg H \) (shorter than 185 cm).

The combined likelihood of both events, assuming independence between the witness testimonies:
\[ P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

So, \( P(E) \) which is the total probability of the combined testimony regardless of height:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.24) \times (0.15) + (0.14) \times (0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability is:
{probability: 0.232}
