To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies, we need to apply Bayes' theorem. Let's designate:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H^c \) as the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event of the first witness reporting the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event of the second witness reporting the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability that first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are, and probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller if they are not).
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (Probability that second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm if they are taller, and probability that second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm if they are not).

Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, we need to calculate \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):

\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
\]

Here, \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \) is the probability both witnesses report their respective observations given the height is 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]

Similarly, \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) \) for height shorter than 185 cm:
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Now, using total probability:
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally:
\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} â‰ˆ 0.232258
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
