To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the data given, we can use Bayes' theorem which is formulated as:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, before considering the witnesses' testimonies;
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood probability of observing the evidence given that \( H \) is true;
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of observing the evidence under all possible circumstances.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From witness 1:
- Correctly identifies >=185 cm 80% of the time ( \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) )
- Incorrectly identifies <185 cm 20% of the time ( \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) )

From witness 2:
- Correctly identifies <185 cm 70% of the time ( \( P(\neg E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) )
- Incorrectly identifies >=185 cm 30% of the time ( \( P(\neg E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) )

Considering only the testimony of the first witness, since the second witness's testimony is contradictory and not requested in the calculation:
\[ P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \] (Probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is tall)
\[ P(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \] (Probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is short)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]

Where \( P(E_1) \) (total probability of witness 1 giving their testimony) can be calculated as:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back:
\[ P(H \mid E_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H \mid E_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the required estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the testimony of the first witness, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
