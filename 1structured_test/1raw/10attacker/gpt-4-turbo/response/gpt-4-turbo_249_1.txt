To solve this problem, we should use Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

To begin, we need to define our variables:
- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (The first witness correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(E_1 | H^c) = 0.20 \) (The first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time.)
- \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (The second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(E_2 | H^c) = 0.70 \) (The second witness correctly identifies those shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker was tall given that the first witness claimed they were tall.

Using the definition of conditional probability and the law of total probability, Bayes' theorem tells us:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]
Where:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E_1 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now we substitute these values back into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.
