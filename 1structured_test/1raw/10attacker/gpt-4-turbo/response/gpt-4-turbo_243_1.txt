To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness reports and their respective accuracies, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( H^c \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% is shorter)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (First witness is 80% accurate when the person is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (First witness is 20% likely to be wrong if the person is shorter than 185 cm, i.e., they say the person is taller when they are not)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness is 30% likely to be wrong when the person is 185 cm or taller, i.e., they say the person is shorter when they're not)
- \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (Second witness is 70% accurate when the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \). Using Bayesian updating with conflicting reports, we can first calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) \times P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Now find \( P(W_1, W_2) \) using total probability theorem:
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) \times P(H^c) 
\]
\[
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
= \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.2323.
