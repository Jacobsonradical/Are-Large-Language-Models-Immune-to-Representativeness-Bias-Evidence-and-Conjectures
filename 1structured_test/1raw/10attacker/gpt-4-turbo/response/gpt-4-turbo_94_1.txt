To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) represents the evidence about the witness's statements.

From the information:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability of being 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15.
- \( P(\lnot H) \) (prior probability of being shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85.

The ability of witnesses to correctly judge someone's height:
- Witness 1:
  - Correct 80% of the time if the person is as tall as they say.
  - Therefore, \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability that witness 1 correctly says taller when attacker is indeed taller).
  - \( P(E_1 \mid \lnot H) = 0.2 \) (probability that witness 1 incorrectly says taller when attacker is shorter).
  
- Witness 2:
  - Correct 70% of the time.
  - Therefore, \( P(E_2 \mid \lnot H) = 0.7 \) (probability that witness 2 correctly says shorter when attacker is shorter).
  - \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (probability that witness 2 incorrectly says shorter when attacker is taller).

Using the total law of probability, \( P(E) \) (combined probability of the evidence) can be calculated as follows:
\[ P(E) = P(E_1 \cap E_2) \]
\[ = P(E_1 \mid H) P(E_2 \mid H) P(H) + P(E_1 \mid \lnot H) P(E_2 \mid \lnot H) P(\lnot H) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

The probability of the hypothesis given the evidence \( P(H \mid E) \) is:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E_1 \mid H) P(E_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is about 0.232.

Therefore, the final answer in the required format would be:
{ "probability": 0.232 }
