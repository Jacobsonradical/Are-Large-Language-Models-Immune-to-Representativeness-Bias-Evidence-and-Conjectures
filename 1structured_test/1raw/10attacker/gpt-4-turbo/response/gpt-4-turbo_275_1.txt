To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayesian reasoning, we begin by naming our hypothesis and evidence:

\( H \) = Hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
\( \neg H \) = Hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
\( E_1 = \) Evidence from witness 1 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
\( E_2 = \) Evidence from witness 2 that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The prior probabilities from the problem are:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]  \( (15\% \text{ of the population}) \)
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]  \( (85\% \text{ of the population}) \)

The problem provides us with the following likelihoods:
Witness 1: Correctly judges someone's height as being at or above 185 cm 80% of the time if they are indeed that tall.
\[ P(E_1 | H) = 0.8 \]
Witness 1: Incorrectly judges someone's height as being at or above 185 cm 20% of the time if they are in fact shorter.
\[ P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \]

Witness 2: Correctly judges someone's height as being below 185 cm 70% of the time if they are indeed that short.
\[ P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \]
Witness 2: Incorrectly judges someone's height as being below 185 cm 30% of the time if they are in fact taller.
\[ P(E_2 | H) = 0.3 \]

First we compute:
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H)P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H)P(E_2 | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H)P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Then we find:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1,E_2 | H)P(H)}{P(E_1,E_2)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.232 \]

So the probability that the attacker was taller than or equal to 185 cm, given the conflicting accounts of the witnesses, is approximately:
\[ \{ \text{probability: 0.232} \} \]
