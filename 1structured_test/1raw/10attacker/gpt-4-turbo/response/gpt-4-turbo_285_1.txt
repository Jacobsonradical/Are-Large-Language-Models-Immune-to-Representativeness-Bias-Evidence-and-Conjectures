To solve this, we'll use Bayes' Theorem, which is expressed as:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that one witness observed the attacker as 185 cm or taller and one as shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of obtaining the witnesses' observations given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of the witnesses' observations.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) \), the probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \), the complement of \( A \) (i.e., attacker is shorter than 185 cm), is 0.85.

We need to calculate:
- \( P(B|A) \): This is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is really 185 cm or taller. This probability is \( 0.8 \times 0.3 \) because the first witness is correct 80% of the time and the second witness is incorrect 30% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(B|A^c) \): This is the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller and the second witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm. This probability is \( 0.2 \times 0.7 \) because the first witness is incorrect 20% of the time and the second witness is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Now compute:
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(B|A^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Then \( P(B) \), the total probability of observing B, can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:
- \( P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A) + P(B|A^c) \times P(A^c) \)
- \( P(B) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \)
- \( P(A|B) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \)

Rounded to a more manageable numeric value:
- \( P(A|B) \approx 0.23 \)

So, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{probability: 0.23}
