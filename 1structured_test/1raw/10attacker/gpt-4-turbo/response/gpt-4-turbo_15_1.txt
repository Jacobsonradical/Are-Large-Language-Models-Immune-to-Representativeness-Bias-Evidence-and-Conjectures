To solve this problem, we apply Bayesian probability principles. We begin with the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (or 0.15), and the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (or 0.85).

We also have information on the conditional probabilities based on the witnesses' testimonies:
- The first witness, who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, is correct about 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- The second witness, who claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, is correct about 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

Let us use \(A\) for the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \(W_1\) and \(W_2\) for the witnesses' claims that the attacker is "185 cm or taller" and "shorter than 185 cm," respectively.

The probability that both witnesses are correct simultaneously is the sum of:
1. Probability both witnesses are correct given \(A\): \( P(W_1 \text{ correct} | A) \cdot P(W_2 \text{ wrong} | \neg A) \times P(A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 \times 0.15\)
2. Probability both witnesses are wrong given \(\neg A\): \( P(W_1 \text{ wrong} | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 \text{ correct} | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 \times 0.85\)

Now, computing the actual probabilities:
1. \(0.80 \times 0.30 \times 0.15 = 0.036\)
2. \(0.20 \times 0.70 \times 0.85 = 0.119\)

Thus, the total likelihood that witness declarations are true under any circumstance is \(0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\).

Now, we are interested in \(P(A | W_1 \text{ says tall }, W_2 \text{ says short})\), which is finding the probability of attacker being tall given the two witness claims. This is calculated using Bayes' rule:
\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ tall, } W_2 \text{ short}) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ tall } | A) \cdot P(W_2 \text{ short } | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1 \text{ tall }, W_2 \text{ short})}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
P(A | W_1 \text{ tall, } W_2 \text{ short}) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.30 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]
Thus, the probability estimate of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting witness statements and their accuracies, is about 0.232.
