To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from the two witnesses and the distribution of heights in the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given from the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies a taller person 80% of the time)
- \( P(B_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a shorter person as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a taller person as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(B_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies a shorter person 70% of the time)

We want to find \( P(A | B_1, B_2) \). First, calculate \( P(B_1, B_2) \):

\[ P(B_1, B_2) = P(B_1, B_2 | A) P(A) + P(B_1, B_2 | A^c) P(A^c) \]

Where:
- \( P(B_1, B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A) P(B_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(B_1, B_2 | A^c) = P(B_1 | A^c) P(B_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Thus:
\[ P(B_1, B_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B_1, B_2) = \frac{P(B_1, B_2 | A) P(A)}{P(B_1, B_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Hence:
{probability: 0.232}
