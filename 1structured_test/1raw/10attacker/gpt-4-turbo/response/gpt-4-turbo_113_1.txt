To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps us incorporate new evidence to update our beliefs about the probability of an event. Specifically, we are dealing with conditional probabilities, where:
- \(H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_1 \) is the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2 \) is the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. 

We know:
- \(P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\text{not } H) = P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability Witness 1 is right, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W_1 | \overline{H}) = 0.2 \) (probability Witness 1 errs, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \)  (probability Witness 2 errs, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W_2 | \overline{H}) = 0.7 \) (probability Witness 2 is right, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find \(P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 saw the attacker as 185 cm or taller. 

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]
To calculate \(P(W_1)\):
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | \overline{H}) \cdot P(\overline{H})
\]

Plugging in values:
\[
P(W_1) = (0.8) (0.15) + (0.2) (0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, using Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
