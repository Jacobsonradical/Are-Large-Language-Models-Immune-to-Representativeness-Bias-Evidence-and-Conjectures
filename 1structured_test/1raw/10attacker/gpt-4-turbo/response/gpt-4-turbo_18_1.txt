To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) as the evidence provided by witness 1 and witness 2 respectively.

1. **Initial probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Witness reliabilities:**
   - Witness 1: Correctly identifies height 80% (correct if H and if \( \neg H \))
   - Witness 2: Correctly identifies height 70% (correct if H and if \( \neg H \))

   Thus, the probabilities of witnesses being correct or wrong are:
   - \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \)
   - \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \)

3. **Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:**
   
   We need \( P(H \mid E_1, E_2) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements:

   \[
   P(H \mid E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)}
   \]

   We can calculate \( P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) \) and \( P(E_1, E_2 \mid \neg H) \) to find \( P(E_1, E_2) \) by the law of total probability:

   - \( P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(E_1, E_2 \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

   \[
   P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 \mid H) P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

   Finally, substituting back we get:
   
   \[
   P(H \mid E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' testimonies and the reliability of their judgements under the conditions described, is approximately 0.2323. 

**Answer:** {probability: 0.2323}
