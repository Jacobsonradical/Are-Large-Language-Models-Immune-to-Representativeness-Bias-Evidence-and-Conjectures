To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define \( H = \text{"attacker's height is 185 cm or taller"} \) and \( \neg H = \text{"attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm"} \).

The prior probabilities are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \), since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \), since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

Let \( W_1 \) be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. From the information given:
- Witness 1 has an 80% correct rate: \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 has a 70% correct rate: \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.7 \).

We seek \( P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims. Using the law of total probability and Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2|H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (P(W_1|H)P(W_2|H))P(H) + (P(W_1|\neg H)P(W_2|\neg H))P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Now we calculate:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|H)P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' claims, is about 0.2323.
