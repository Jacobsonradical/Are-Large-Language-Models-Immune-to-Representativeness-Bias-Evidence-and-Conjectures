To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem. First, let's define the events:

- Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg H \) represent the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W_1 \) represent the event that Witness 1 reports the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_2 \) represent the event that Witness 2 reports the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall individuals 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies tall individuals as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies shorter individuals 70% of the time)

You're interested in finding \( P(H | W_1) \), that is, the probability the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 observed him to be so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]
where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Hence,
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.

Answer: {probability: 0.4138}
