To solve this problem, we'll use Bayesian probability to update our belief in the likelihood that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information from the two witnesses.

Based on the given data:
- The a priori probability \( P(\text{Taller}) \) that a randomly selected person is 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15.
- The a priori probability \( P(\text{Shorter}) \) that a randomly selected person is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (Probability \( P(W_1 | \text{Taller}) = 0.8 \)) and incorrectly states they are taller 20% of the time when they are not (\( P(W_1 | \text{Shorter}) = 0.2 \)).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (\( P(W_2 | \text{Shorter}) = 0.7 \)) and incorrectly states they are shorter 30% of the time when they are not (\( P(W_2 | \text{Taller}) = 0.3 \)).

We're interested in finding \( P(\text{Taller} | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses. We will apply Bayes' theorem and consider the testimonies:

\[
P(\text{Taller} | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | \text{Taller}) \times P(\text{Taller})}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

First, calculating the joint likelihood of witnessing \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \):

1. \( P(W_1, W_2 | \text{Taller}) = P(W_1 | \text{Taller}) \cdot P(W_2 | \text{Taller}) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
2. \( P(W_1, W_2 | \text{Shorter}) = P(W_1 | \text{Shorter}) \cdot P(W_2 | \text{Shorter}) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using the law of total probability for \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | \text{Taller}) \times P(\text{Taller}) + P(W_1, W_2 | \text{Shorter}) \times P(\text{Shorter})
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Using these calculations in Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(\text{Taller} | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore:

{ "probability": 0.232 }
