To solve this problem, we can employ Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimation on the basis of new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( H^c \) be the event "attacker is shorter than 185 cm".
- \( W_1 \) be the event "first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( W_2 \) be the event "second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm".

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Additionally, we know the reliability of each witness:
- First witness is correct 80% of the time, so:
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 is correct, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect, hence claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not).
- Second witness is correct 70% of the time, so:
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect, hence claims the attacker is shorter when they are not).
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H^c) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is correct, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Using Bayes' theorem, let's find \( P(H \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so:

\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]
where
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H)P(H) + P(W_1 \mid H^c)P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Thus,
\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
