To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We will denote:
- \( H \) as the event: "The attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( \neg H \) as the event: "The attacker is shorter than 185 cm."
- \( W_1 \) as the event: "First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller."
- \( W_2 \) as the event: "Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm."

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population are shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness is 80% accurate when identifying people as 185 cm or taller:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (since the first witness made incorrect identifications 20% of the time when a person was shorter than 185 cm)

The second witness is 70% accurate:
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (since the second witness made incorrect identifications 30% of the time when a person was 185 cm or taller)

We assume the testimonies are independent. We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. By using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) 
= 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 
= 0.12 + 0.17 
= 0.29
\]

Substituting these values into Bayes’ theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
= \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
≈ 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller:

{probability: 0.4138}
