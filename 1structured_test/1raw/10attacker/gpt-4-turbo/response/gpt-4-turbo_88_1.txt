To solve this, we will use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event "the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller" and
- \( H^c \) as the event "the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm"; therefore, \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).
- \( W_1 \) as the event "witness 1 correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller",
- \( W_2 \) as the event "witness 2 correctly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm".

From the problem statement:
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) (probability that witness 1 is correct, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W_1|H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller when they are not),
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) (probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm when they are 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W_2|H^c) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is correct when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

To find the combined probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claiming otherwise, given the heights:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2^c|H) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(W_2^c|H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \),
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2^c|H^c) = P(W_1|H^c) \cdot P(W_2^c|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \).

The total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claiming otherwise (law of total probability) is:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2^c) = P(W_1 \cap W_2^c|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2^c|H^c) \cdot P(H^c) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135. \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H|W_1 \cap W_2^c) \):
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2^c|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2^c)} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622. \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:
{ "probability": 0.622 }
