To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the contradictory testimonies of two witnesses and their respective accuracy rates, we can use Bayesian probability.

Let:
- \(H\) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \(L\) be the event "attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \(W_1\) be the event that "witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller"
- \(W_2\) be the event that "witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm"

According to the given data:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(L) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From the witness accuracy data:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so:
  - \(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8\) (probability witness 1 is correct given the person is 185 cm or taller)
  - \(P(W_1 | L) = 0.2\) (probability witness 1 is incorrect given the person is shorter than 185 cm)

- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so:
  - \(P(W_2 | H) = 0.3\) (probability witness 2 is incorrect given the person is 185 cm or taller)
  - \(P(W_2 | L) = 0.7\) (probability witness 2 is correct given the person is shorter than 185 cm)

Now, use the law of total probability to calculate:
- \(P(W_1)\) =\(P(W_1 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 | L)P(L)\)
  - \(= 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\)
  
- \(P(W_2)\) = \(P(W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_2 | L)P(L)\)
  - \(= 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64\)

Using Bayes' theorem, \(P(H | W_1, W_2)\) can be calculated as:
- \(P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138\)
- \(P(H | W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_2)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.64} \approx 0.0703\)

Finally, combining both observations using the fact that the witnesses report independently:
- \(P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(H) P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H)}{P(W_1) P(W_2)} = \frac{0.15 \times 0.8 \times 0.3}{0.29 \times 0.64} \approx 0.163\)

Thus, based on the combined testimony of the witnesses:
- {probability: 0.163}

Please note that the final representation is based on joint conditional probabilities and assumes independent testimonies. Hence, the probability can be used as an indicative estimate.
