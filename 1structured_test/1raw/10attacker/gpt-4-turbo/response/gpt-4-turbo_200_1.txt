To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the information from two witnesses and population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( N \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(N) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|N) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2|N) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We calculate \( P(W_1) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|H)P(H) + P(W_1|N)P(N) 
         = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) 
         = 0.12 + 0.17 
         = 0.29 \]

Now apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to find \( P(H|W_1) \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed so):
\[ P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H)P(H)}{P(W_1)} 
            = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
            = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
            = 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.4138.
