To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability estimate based on new evidence. Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

**Prior probability**, \( P(H) \), that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is given as 15% (from the city’s population statistics). Therefore, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

**The complement of \( H \) is that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm**. The probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \).

**The accuracy of the witnesses:**
- First witness is correct 80% of the time. This means:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- Second witness is correct 70% of the time. This means:
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, because they testified the opposite)
  - \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (Probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**To find the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies**, we use:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

\( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
\( P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

The total probability of seeing both witnesses' testimonies is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, applying Bayes’ theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is about 0.232.
