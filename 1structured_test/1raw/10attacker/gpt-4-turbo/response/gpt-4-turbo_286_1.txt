To solve this question, we'll use Bayes' theorem:

\[ \text{P}(A|B) = \frac{\text{P}(B|A) \times \text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(B)} \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the combined witness statements concerning the attacker's height.

First, let's determine the probabilities we know:
- \( \text{P}(A) \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (given: 15% of the population).
- \( \text{P}(A^c) \) (probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (complement of \( \text{P}(A) \)).

Assuming the witnesses' abilities to accurately judge height are independent of one another:
- \( \text{P}(B_1|A) \): Probability that the first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.80.
- \( \text{P}(B_1|A^c) \): Probability that the first witness is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.20.

- \( \text{P}(B_2|A) \): Probability that the second witness is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.30.
- \( \text{P}(B_2|A^c) \): Probability that the second witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.70.

Given both witness statements \( W_1 \) (first witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller) and \( W_2 \) (second witness says attacker is shorter than 185 cm), we look to find \( \text{P}(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \).

We calculate:
- \( \text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = \text{P}(W_1 | A) \times \text{P}(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \).
- \( \text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) = \text{P}(W_1 | A^c) \times \text{P}(W_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \).

We also need the overall probability of both witness statements \( W_1 \cap W_2 \):
\[ \text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2) = \text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times \text{P}(A) + \text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) \times \text{P}(A^c) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155. \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ \text{P}(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{\text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times \text{P}(A)}{\text{P}(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232. \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.232.

**Answer: {probability: 0.232}**
