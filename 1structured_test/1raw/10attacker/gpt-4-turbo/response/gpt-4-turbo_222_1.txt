To estimate the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesian inference. Specifically, we use Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief about the attacker's height based on the witness testimony.

Let's define:
- H = the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- W1 = the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller,
- W2 = the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height to be shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- P(H^c) = 0.85 (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm),
- P(W1|H) = 0.8 (probability Witness 1 is correct, given attacker is ≥185 cm),
- P(W1|H^c) = 0.2 (probability Witness 1 is incorrect, given attacker is <185 cm),
- P(W2|H) = 0.3 (probability Witness 2 is incorrect, given attacker is ≥185 cm),
- P(W2|H^c) = 0.7 (probability Witness 2 is correct, given attacker is <185 cm).

We want P(H|W1, W2), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims.

We use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Calculating P(W1, W2|H):

\[ P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \times P(W2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Calculating P(W1, W2|H^c):

\[ P(W1, W2|H^c) = P(W1|H^c) \times P(W2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Calculating P(W1, W2):

\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \times P(H) + P(W1, W2|H^c) \times P(H^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus, P(H|W1, W2):

\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is about 0.2323.

Therefore, the answer is:

{probability: 0.2323}
