To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, using the given information from the witnesses and the general population, we apply Bayesian probability calculations.

1. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm. From the given data:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. Let \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
   - Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \).

3. We need to calculate \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's claim:
   \[
   P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
   \]
   where \( P(W_1) \) is the likelihood of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's true height. Using the law of total probability,
   \[
   P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

4. Now plugging values into Bayes' formula:
   \[
   P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the claim of Witness 1, is approximately \( {probability: 0.4138} \).
