To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem allows updating the probability estimate for an event based on new evidence.

1. **Prior Probability (P(H)):**
   Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15

2. **Witness 1 (Correctly Identifies Heights 80% of the Time):**
   - Probability that Witness 1 says "taller" if the attacker is indeed taller = P(E1|H) = 0.80
   - Probability that Witness 1 says "taller" if the attacker is shorter = P(E1|¬H) = 0.20

3. **Witness 2 (Correctly Identifies Heights 70% of the Time):**
   - Probability that Witness 2 says "shorter" if the attacker is indeed shorter = P(E2|¬H) = 0.70
   - Probability that Witness 2 says "shorter" if the attacker is taller = P(E2|H) = 0.30

To find:
- Probability that the attacker is taller given that Witness 1 says "taller" and Witness 2 says "shorter", P(H|E1, E2).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | E1, E2) = \frac{P(E1, E2 | H) P(H)}{P(E1, E2)} \]

Where:
- \(P(E1, E2 | H) = P(E1 | H) \times P(E2 | H)\)
- \(P(E1, E2 | ¬H) = P(E1 | ¬H) \times P(E2 | ¬H)\)
- \(P(E1, E2) = P(E1, E2 | H) P(H) + P(E1, E2 | ¬H) P(¬H)\)

Calculating the components:
- \(P(E1, E2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24\)
- \(P(E1, E2 | ¬H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14\)
- \(P(H) = 0.15\), \(P(¬H) = 0.85\)
- \(P(E1, E2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\)

Putting it all together:
\[ P(H | E1, E2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232 \]
