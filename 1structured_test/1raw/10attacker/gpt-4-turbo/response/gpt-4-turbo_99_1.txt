To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony and the general height distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our prior probability estimates based on new evidence.

Let H be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. Given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(~H) = 0.85 (85% of the city population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to consider the probability of each witness's testimony given H and ~H:
- Let W1 be the event "first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and W2 be "second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm."

Given the data:
- P(W1 | H) = 0.80 (80% chance the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- P(W1 | ~H) = 0.20 (20% chance the first witness mistakenly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

- P(W2 | H) = 0.30 (30% chance the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2 | ~H) = 0.70 (70% chance the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

Now using Bayes' theorem, we calculate the probability of H given the witnesses' testimonies:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W1 | ~H) \times P(~H) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately 0.414.
