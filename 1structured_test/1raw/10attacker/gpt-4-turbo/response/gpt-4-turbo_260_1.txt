To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' rule to update our belief about the height of the attacker based on the testimonies of the witnesses. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.

Witness 1:
- Correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time: \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \).
- Incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time: \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \).

Witness 2:
- Correctly identifies short people 70% of the time: \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \).
- Incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time: \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \).

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies, we first consider the joint probability of both testimonies (assuming independence between the witness testimonies for simplification):

\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, apply Bayes' rule:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2323.
