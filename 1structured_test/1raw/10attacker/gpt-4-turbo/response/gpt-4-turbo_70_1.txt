To solve this problem, we will apply Bayes' Theorem which relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. Here, we are trying to estimate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements.

Bayes' Theorem is stated as follows:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the probability of event A given that B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the probability of observing B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A occurring.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing B.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that at least one witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Based on the witnesses' accuracy:
- Witness 1 accuracy: \( P(W1|A) = 0.80, P(W1|A^c) = 0.20 \)
- Witness 2 accuracy: \( P(W2|A) = 0.30, P(W2|A^c) = 0.70 \)

We need \( P(W_1 \text{ or } W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \text{ or } W_2 | A^c) \), which involve combining the probabilities that either witness is correct for the attacker being taller or shorter respectively.

Using probability of either events:
\[ P(W1 \text{ or } W2 | A) = P(W1 | A) + P(W2 | A) - P(W1 \cap W2 | A) \]
\[ = 0.80 + 0.30 - (0.80 \times 0.30) = 1.10 - 0.24 = 0.86 \]

\[ P(W1 \text{ or } W2 | A^c) = P(W1 | A^c) + P(W2 | A^c) - P(W1 \cap W2 | A^c) \]
\[ = 0.20 + 0.70 - (0.20 \times 0.70) = 0.90 - 0.14 = 0.76 \]

Total probability of getting at least one claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W1 \text{ or } W2) = P(W1 \text{ or } W2 | A)P(A) + P(W1 \text{ or } W2 | A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ = 0.86 \times 0.15 + 0.76 \times 0.85 = 0.1290 + 0.6460 = 0.775 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A | W1 \text{ or } W2) = \frac{P(W1 \text{ or } W2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W1 \text{ or } W2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.86 \times 0.15}{0.775} = \frac{0.1290}{0.775} \approx 0.1665 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements is approximately:
{probability: 0.1665}
