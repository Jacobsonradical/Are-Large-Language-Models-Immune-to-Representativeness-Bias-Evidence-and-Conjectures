To solve this problem, we'll use Bayesian probability concepts. We need to find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the claims of the two witnesses.

We use:
- The probability that a person is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- The probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller. The likelihood that this witness correctly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller is 0.80; the likelihood that they incorrectly identify someone who is shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller is 0.20.

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The likelihood that this witness correctly identifies someone who is shorter than 185 cm is 0.70; the likelihood that they incorrectly identify someone who is 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm is 0.30.

We calculate the following:
- The probability that both witness 1 is correct and witness 2 is incorrect, which indicates that the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_1H \cap W_2\neg H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- The probability that both witness 1 is incorrect and witness 2 is correct, which indicates that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_1\neg H \cap W_2H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, the full probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimony (\( P(H | W_1, W_2) \)) is:
\[ 
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1H \cap W_2\neg H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1H \cap W_2\neg H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1\neg H \cap W_2H) \cdot P(\neg H)} 
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85}
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119}
\]
\[ 
= \frac{0.036}{0.155}
\]
\[ 
= 0.2323 
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.
