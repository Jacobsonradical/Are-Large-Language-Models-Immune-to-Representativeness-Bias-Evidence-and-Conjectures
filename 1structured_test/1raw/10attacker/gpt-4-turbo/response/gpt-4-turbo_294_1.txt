To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use the formula for conditional probability and the total probability theorem. We can denote:

- \( P(H) \) = Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15% of the population)
- \( P(L) \) = Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85% of the population)
- \( P(W_1|H) \) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is taller = 0.80
- \( P(W_1|L) \) = Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter = 0.20
- \( P(W_2|H) \) = Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter given the attacker is taller = 0.30
- \( P(W_2|L) \) = Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter given the attacker is shorter = 0.70
- We need \( P(H|W_1, W_2) \): The probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of both witnesses.

First, we calculate:

- \( P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L) \) = Probability both witnesses give the testimony that they did â€“ the first witness correctly identifies attacker 185 cm or taller; the second witness incorrectly identifies attacker as shorter.

Using the theorem of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L) = P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L|H)P(H) + P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L|L)P(L) \]
\[ P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L|H) = P(W_1 = H|H)P(W_2 = L|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L|L) = P(W_1 = H|L)P(W_2 = L|L) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, calculate the probability we need:
\[ P(H|W_1 = H, W_2 = L) = \frac{P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L|H)P(H)}{P(W_1 = H, W_2 = L)} \]
\[ P(H|W_1 = H, W_2 = L) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness but contradicted by the second witness, is approximately:

{probability: 0.232}
