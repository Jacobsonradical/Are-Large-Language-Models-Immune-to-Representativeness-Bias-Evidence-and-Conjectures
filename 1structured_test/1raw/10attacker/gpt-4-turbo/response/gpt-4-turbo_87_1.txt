To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let:

- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness accuracy:
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.8 \) (witness 1 is 80% accurate when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|\neg A) = 0.2 \) (witness 1 has a 20% error rate, i.e., saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not)

- \( P(W_2|A) = 0.3 \) (witness 2 has a 30% error rate, i.e., saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are not)
- \( P(W_2|\neg A) = 0.7 \) (witness 2 is 70% accurate when the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Adam Wintle and Wood provided that the witnesses both saw the same event, we'll assume witness testimonies are conditionally independent given the attacker's height. Thus, \( P(W_1\cap W_2|A) = P(W_1|A) \times P(W_2|A) \) and \( P(W_1\cap W_2|\neg A) = P(W_1|\neg A) \times P(W_2|\neg A) \).

Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2|A)P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2|\neg A)P(\neg A) \)
- \( = (P(W_1|A) \times P(W_2|A)) \times P(A) + (P(W_1|\neg A) \times P(W_2|\neg A)) \times P(\neg A) \)

Substitute values:
- \( = (0.8 \times 0.3) \times 0.15 + (0.2 \times 0.7) \times 0.85 \)
- \( = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \)
- \( = 0.036 + 0.119 \)
- \( = 0.155 \)

Now calculate \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(A|W_1\cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|A)P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \)
- \( = \frac{(0.24 \times 0.15)}{0.155} \)
- \( = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \)
- \( = 0.2323 \) approximately.

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
