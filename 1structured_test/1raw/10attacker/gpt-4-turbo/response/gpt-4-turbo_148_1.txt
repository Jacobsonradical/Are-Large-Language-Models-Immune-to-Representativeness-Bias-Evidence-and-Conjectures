To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. 

Let's define our events:
- \( A \) = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg A \) = Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W_1 \) = First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W_2 \) = Second witness says attacker is shorter than 185 cm

We need to calculate \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

**Using Bayes' Theorem:**
\[ P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Let us evaluate each term:

1. **\( P(A) \) and \( P(\neg A) \)**
   - From information \( "b" \), we know \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)

2. **\( P(W_1 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg A) \)** 
   - First witness is correct 80% of the time, hence \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.8 \). They are incorrect 20% if the person is shorter: \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \).

3. **\( P(W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_2 | \neg A) \)** 
   - Second witness is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter, \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) and incorrect 30% if the person is taller: \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.3 \).

**Evaluate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \):**
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(W_2 | A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \times P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

**Evaluate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):**
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg A) \times P(\neg A) \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

**Finally, evaluate \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) \):**
- \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} ≈ \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232258 \)

Hence, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the witnesses, is approximately **0.2323**.
