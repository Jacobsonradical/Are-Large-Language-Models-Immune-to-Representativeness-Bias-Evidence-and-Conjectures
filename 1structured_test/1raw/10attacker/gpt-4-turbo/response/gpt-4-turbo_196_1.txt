To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps update the probability estimate of an event based on new evidence. Here's how we can solve this:

1. Define A as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Define B as the combined evidence of the witnesses' testimonies.
   
   - P(A) (Prior Probability of A): Probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15.
   - P(A^c) (Prior Probability of not A): Probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85.

2. Define B1 as the event where the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and B2 as the event where the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   
   - P(B1|A): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8.
   - P(B1|A^c): Probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 20% = 0.2 (as they err 20% of the time for those shorter than 185 cm).

   - P(B2|A): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 30% = 0.3 (as they err 30% of the time for those 185 cm or taller).
   - P(B2|A^c): Probability that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 70% = 0.7.

3. Using the independence of the two witnesses, we calculate:
   
   - P(B1, B2|A) = P(B1|A) * P(B2|A) = 0.8 * 0.3 = 0.24.
   - P(B1, B2|A^c) = P(B1|A^c) * P(B2|A^c) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14.

4. Using the law of total probability:
   
   - P(B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) + P(B1, B2|A^c)P(A^c)
   = (0.24)(0.15) + (0.14)(0.85)
   = 0.036 + 0.119
   = 0.155.

5. Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem to find P(A|B1, B2):

   - P(A|B1, B2) = P(B1, B2|A)P(A) / P(B1, B2)
   = (0.036) / (0.155)
   = ~0.232.

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witness testimonies, is approximately 0.232.
