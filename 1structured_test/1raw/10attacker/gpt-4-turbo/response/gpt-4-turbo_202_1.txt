To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller using Bayesian probability, we start by defining:

- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (accuracy 80%).
- \( W_2 \): Second witness's testimony that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (accuracy 70%).

Given prior probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

Likelihoods based on witnesses’ accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies taller individuals 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies shorter individuals 70% of the time)

Using the rule of total probability to find the probability of the witnesses’ testimonies:
- \( P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
- \( P(W_2) = P(W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.7 \times 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \)

Applying Bayes' Theorem to find the updated probability of \( H \) given both pieces of witness testimony, we apply:
- \( P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1,W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \)

where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H)\)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Finally:
- \( P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.231 \)

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies is approximately 0.231.
