To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps in updating our probability estimate based on new evidence. We will integrate information from the population data and the reliability of the witnesses.

Define:
- \( H \): Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( L \): Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W_1 \): Testimony of the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- \( W_2 \): Testimony of the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness reliability (given that the witness is right if the attacker is actually of the claimed height category, and wrong otherwise):
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies taller people as shorter 30% of the time)

Since the witnesses' testimonies are independent given the attacker's height, the joint probability of both testimonies given the height is:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | L) = P(W_1 | L) \times P(W_2 | L) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using the law of total probability, the probability of the witnesses' combined testimonies is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | L) \times P(L) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witness statements:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.232}
