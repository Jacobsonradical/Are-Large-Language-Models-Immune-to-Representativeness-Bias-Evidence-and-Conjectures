We can solve this problem with Bayesian probability principles. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and \( H^c \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We also let \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \)
- Witness 1 (W1) correctly identifies that someone is 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and is wrong 20% of the time. Thus, \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W1|H^c) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 (W2) correctly identifies that someone is shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and is wrong 30% of the time. Thus, \( P(W2|H^c) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \).

We aim to find \( P(H|W1, W2) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' claims. According to Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|H)P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H)P(H) + P(W1, W2|H^c)P(H^c) \]

Calculating each term:
- \( P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H)P(W2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1, W2|H^c) = P(W1|H^c)P(W2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

So:
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is about 0.23226.
