To solve this problem, we'll use Bayes' theorem which helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this scenario, our hypothesis is “the attacker is 185 cm or taller.” Let \( H \) denote this hypothesis. We have two pieces of evidence from eyewitnesses:
- \( E_1 \): First witness’s testimony that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \): Second witness’s testimony that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First, we compute our prior beliefs about \( H \) before considering the eyewitnesses:
- \( P(H) \) (the probability of a person being 185 cm or taller) = 15% = 0.15
- \( P(\neg H) \) (the probability of a person being shorter than 185 cm) = 85% = 0.85

Next, consider the reliabilities of the witnesses:
- First witness is correct 80% of the time, so:
  - \( P(E_1 | H) \) (probability of \( E_1 \) given \( H \)) = 0.80
  - \( P(E_1 | \neg H) \) (probability of \( E_1 \) given \( \neg H \)) = 0.20 (since if the attacker is actually short, the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying them as tall is 20%)
- Second witness is correct 70% of the time, so:
  - \( P(E_2 | \neg H) \) (probability of \( E_2 \) given \( \neg H \)) = 0.70
  - \( P(E_2 | H) \) (probability of \( E_2 \) given \( H \)) = 0.30 (since if the attacker is actually tall, the likelihood of the witness incorrectly identifying them as short is 30%)

Applying Bayes' theorem to revise \( P(H) \) based on \( E_1 \):
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]

To calculate \( P(E_1) \):
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, \( P(H | E_1) \):
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to revise \( P(H | E_1) \) based on \( E_2 \):
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_2 | H) P(H | E_1)}{P(E_2 | E_1)} \]

To calculate \( P(E_2 | E_1) \):
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = P(E_2 | H, E_1) P(H | E_1) + P(E_2 | \neg H, E_1) P(\neg H | E_1) \]
\[ P(E_2 | E_1) = 0.30 \times 0.4138 + 0.70 \times 0.5862 = 0.1241 + 0.4103 = 0.5344 \]

So, \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \):
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.4138}{0.5344} = \frac{0.12414}{0.5344} \approx 0.2322 \]

Thus, after considering both witnesses, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2322. This integrates all given probabilities and the reliability of the witnesses.

Therefore, the final answer is:
{probability: 0.2322}
