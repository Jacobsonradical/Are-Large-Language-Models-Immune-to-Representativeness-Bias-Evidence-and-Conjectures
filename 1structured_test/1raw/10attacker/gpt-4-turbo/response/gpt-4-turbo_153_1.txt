To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the two witnesses' testimonies, we can utilize Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \(A\) represent the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(A^C\) represent the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\) represent the event that the first witness stated the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) represent the event that the second witness stated the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the data given:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(A^C) = 0.85\) (probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(W_1 | A) = 0.8\) (probability the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or tall)
- \(P(W_1 | A^C) = 0.2\) (probability the first witness incorrectly identified someone as being 185 cm or taller when they were shorter)
- \(P(W_2 | A) = 0.3\) (probability the second witness incorrectly identified someone as shorter when they were 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(W_2 | A^C) = 0.7\) (probability the second witness correctly identified someone as shorter than 185 cm)

We are interested in finding \(P(A | W_1)\), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness said so. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1)}
\]

To find \(P(W_1)\), which is the marginal probability that the first witness says the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we use the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 | A^C) \times P(A^C)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus, using Bayes' theorem,
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is about 0.4138.
