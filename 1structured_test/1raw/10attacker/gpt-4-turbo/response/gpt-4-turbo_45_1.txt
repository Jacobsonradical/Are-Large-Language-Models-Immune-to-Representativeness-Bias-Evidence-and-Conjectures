To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context states:

\[ P(H \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W)} \]

Here, \( H \) represents the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( W \) represents the evidence provided by the witnesses.

We are given:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

From witness 1:
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) \) (the probability of witness 1 correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \) (the probability of witness 1 incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20.

From witness 2:
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) \) (the probability of witness 2 incorrectly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm) = 0.30.
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) \) (the probability of witness 2 correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm) = 0.70.

We need to find \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2) \). We do this by considering both witnesses' testimonies:

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Since the performances of the witnesses are independent:

\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then the total probability of observing \( W_1, W_2 \):

\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now plug these into Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.2323. However, since the question asks us to consider only the first witness's claim about the attacker being taller:

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H)P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Here:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H)P(H) + P(W_1 \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

\[ P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, based on the first witness's testimony:
{probability: 0.4138}
