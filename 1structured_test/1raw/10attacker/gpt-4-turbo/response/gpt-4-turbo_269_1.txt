To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we will use Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let:
\( H \) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
\( \overline{H} \) be the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
\( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) be the witness events with \( W_1 \) stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller and \( W_2 \) stating the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Based on the problem:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) \) = 0.8 (80% accuracy by Witness 1 when the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \overline{H}) \) = 0.2 (20% error by Witness 1, thus stating 185 cm or taller when not)
- \( P(W_2 | \overline{H}) \) = 0.7 (70% accuracy by Witness 2 when the attacker is indeed shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) \) = 0.3 (30% error by Witness 2, thus stating shorter when not)

We need the posterior probability \( P(H | W_1) \) which is the probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 said so. Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} 
\]
Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ 
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H})
\]
Substituting the values:
\[ 
P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Now, calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ 
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness's statement, is approximately 0.4138.
