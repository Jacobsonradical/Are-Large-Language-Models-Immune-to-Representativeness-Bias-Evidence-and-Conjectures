To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem helps us update our initial belief in a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witness statements). Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( A^c \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm,
- \( W_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 correctly claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1's accuracy if the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1's error rate if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2's accuracy if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2's error rate if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

We want to find \( P(A | W_1) \) and \( P(A | W_2) \):
1. First, compute \( P(W_1) \) using total probability:
   \[
   P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) P(A) + P(W_1 | A^c) P(A^c)
         = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85
         = 0.12 + 0.17
         = 0.29
   \]

2. Then, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A | W_1) \):
   \[
   P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1)}
             = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29}
             = \frac{0.12}{0.29}
             \approx 0.414
   \]

3. Compute \( P(W_2) \):
   \[
   P(W_2) = P(W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_2 | A^c) P(A^c)
          = 0.30 \times 0.15 + 0.70 \times 0.85
          = 0.045 + 0.595
          = 0.64
   \]

4. And apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(A | W_2) \):
   \[
   P(A | W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_2)}
             = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.64}
             = \frac{0.045}{0.64}
             â‰ˆ 0.070
   \]

Since we seek the estimate of probability given only by Witness 1 (where \( W_1 \) is interpreted as the claimed event of seeing an attacker 185 cm or taller), the answer is:
\({probability: 0.414} \).
