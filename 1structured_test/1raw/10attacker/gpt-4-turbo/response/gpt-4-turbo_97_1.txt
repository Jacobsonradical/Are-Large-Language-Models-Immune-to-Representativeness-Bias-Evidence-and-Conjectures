To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which updates our beliefs about the probability of an event based on new evidence. Let us denote:

- \( H \): The attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): The attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the initial information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From witness reliability:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)

- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We seek to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the claim by the first witness. By Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

where \( P(W_1) \) (the probability of witness 1 making their claim) can be found by the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Using these in Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the claim of the first witness, is approximately 0.414.
