To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we will use Bayesian probability.

Let:
- \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( A \) denote the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) denote the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From witness 1 (correct 80% of the time):
- \( P(A|H) = 0.80 \) (probability the first witness correctly identifies the height as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller)

From witness 2 (correct 70% of the time):
- \( P(B|H) = 0.30 \) (probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone who is 185 cm or taller as being shorter)
- \( P(B|\neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H|A \cap B) \) (the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements), using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|A \cap B) = \frac{P(A \cap B|H) P(H)}{P(A \cap B)}
\]

Where
\[
P(A \cap B|H) = P(A|H) \times P(B|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(A \cap B|\neg H) = P(A|\neg H) \times P(B|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, the total probability of \( A \cap B \) (using the law of total probability):

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A \cap B|H) P(H) + P(A \cap B|\neg H) P(\neg H)
           = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
           = 0.036 + 0.119
           = 0.155
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H|A \cap B) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering both witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.2323.
