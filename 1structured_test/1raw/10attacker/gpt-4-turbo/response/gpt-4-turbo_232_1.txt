To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies of the witnesses and the distribution of heights in the population, we can use Bayesian probability.

We define:
- \( p(H) \) as the prior probability of the height being 185 cm or above, 
- \( p(\text{not } H) \) as the prior probability of the height being below 185 cm,
- \( p(W_1 | H) \) as the probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller,
- \( p(W_1 | \text{not } H) \) as the probability the first witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller,
- \( p(W_2 | H) \) as the probability the second witness mistakenly identifies someone as below 185 cm,
- \( p(W_2 | \text{not } H) \) as the probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as below 185 cm.

From the information given:
- Prior probability estimates based on population statistics: \( p(H) = 0.15 \) and \( p(\text{not } H) = 0.85 \).
- Witness reliability estimates: \( p(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \), \( p(W_1 | \text{not } H) = 0.20 \), \( p(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \), and \( p(W_2 | \text{not } H) = 0.70 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ p(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{p(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot p(H)}{p(W_1, W_2)} \]

\[ p(W_1, W_2 | H) = p(W_1 | H) \cdot p(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \]

\[ p(W_1, W_2 | \text{not } H) = p(W_1 | \text{not } H) \cdot p(W_2 | \text{not } H) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of observing the witnesses' testimonies \( p(W_1, W_2) \) is:
\[ p(W_1, W_2) = p(W_1, W_2 | H) \cdot p(H) + p(W_1, W_2 | \text{not } H) \cdot p(\text{not } H) \]
\[ = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Finally, computing the posterior probability \( p(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[ p(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
