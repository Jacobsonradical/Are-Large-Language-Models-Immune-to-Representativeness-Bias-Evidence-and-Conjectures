To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given conflicting witness statements and their respective accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The formula we will use is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where,
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses,
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of \( H \) (probability before considering the witnesses),
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the hypothesis is true,
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence occurring.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\text{not } H) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm),
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(E_1 \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2 \),
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so \( P(E_2 \mid \text{not } H) = 0.7 \) and \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \).

Both witnesses provide independent evidence, so using the product rule for independent evidence:

\[ P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E \mid \text{not } H) = P(E_1 \mid \text{not } H) \times P(E_2 \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Next, calculate \( P(E) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \text{not } H) \times P(\text{not } H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H \mid E) \):

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the evidence of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.2323.

Answer:
{probability: 0.2323}
