To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Given that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and the second witness claims otherwise, let's calculate the probability based on their accuracies and the general population distribution.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( H^c \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- The first witness identifies correctly 80% of the time: 
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is really 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1^c | H) = 0.20 \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is really 185 cm or taller)
  - Conversely, \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.20 \) (probability witness 1 claims 185 cm or taller wrongly, given the attacker is actually shorter)
- The second witness identifies correctly 70% of the time:
  - \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.70 \) (probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is really shorter)
  - \( P(W_2^c | H^c) = 0.30 \)
  - Conversely, \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter wrongly, given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)

Applying Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) P(H^c)
       = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29
\]

Thus,

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Since we're only considering the first witness in this calculation:

\{probability: 0.4138\}
