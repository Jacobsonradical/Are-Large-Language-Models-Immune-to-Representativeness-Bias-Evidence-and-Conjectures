To solve this problem, we apply Bayesian reasoning. We define the following parameters:

- H_+: The hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- H_-: The hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
  
Using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H_+ | E) = \frac{P(E | H_+) P(H_+)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H_+) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H_-) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm)

The likelihood of evidence \( E \) given the hypotheses:
- \( P(E | H_+) = P(E_1 | H_+) \times P(E_2 | H_+) \)
- \( P(E | H_-) = P(E_1 | H_-) \times P(E_2 | H_-) \)

From the witness accuracy:
- Witness 1 has an 80% accuracy rate when people are 185 cm or taller, and an 20% error rate otherwise. Thus:
   - \( P(E_1 | H_+) = 0.8 \)
   - \( P(E_1 | H_-) = 0.2 \)
  
- Witness 2 has a 70% accuracy rate when people are shorter than 185 cm, and a 30% error rate otherwise. Thus:
   - \( P(E_2 | H_+) = 0.3 \)
   - \( P(E_2 | H_-) = 0.7 \)

Combining probabilities:
- \( P(E | H_+) = P(E_1 | H_+) \times P(E_2 | H_+) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E | H_-) = P(E_1 | H_-) \times P(E_2 | H_-) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Finally, compute the total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \):
- \( P(E) = P(E | H_+)P(H_+) + P(E | H_-)P(H_-) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Then,
\[ P(H_+ | E) = \frac{P(E | H_+) P(H_+)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

{probability: 0.232}
