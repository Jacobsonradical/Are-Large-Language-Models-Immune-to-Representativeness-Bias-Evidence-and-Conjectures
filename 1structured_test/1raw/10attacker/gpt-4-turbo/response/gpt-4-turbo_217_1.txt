To answer this question, we can use Bayes' theorem with the given probabilities and the provided testimonies of the two witnesses. Bayes' theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis, in this case, "the attacker was 185 cm or taller," based on new evidence, which are the testimonies of the witnesses.

Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Prior probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- Prior probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. The given truth rates for the witnesses' abilities to judge the height under the conditions are:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability first witness incorrectly claims the height given the attacker is shorter),
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability second witness is incorrect, claiming the attacker is shorter when he is not),
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability second witness is correct).

We start with the testimony of both witnesses, considering them independent:

1. Joint probability both witnesses are correct:
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
   \]
   
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
   \]

2. Probability witnesses claim what they do:
   \[
   P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
   \]

3. Updated probability\(\ H \) is true given their testimonies using Bayes' theorem:
   \[
   P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
   \]

This probability \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \approx 0.232 \) suggests that given the conflicting witness testimonies and the prior probabilities based on population statistics, the likelihood that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 23.2%. 

Thus, the response in the required format is: 
{probability: 0.232}
