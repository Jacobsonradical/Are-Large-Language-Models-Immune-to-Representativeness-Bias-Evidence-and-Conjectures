To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the given information, we apply Bayes' theorem. This theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events, especially useful here given the contradictory witness reports and known population distribution. Let's denote:
- \( H_+ \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller",
- \( H_- \) as the event "attacker is shorter than 185 cm",
- \( W_1^+ \) as the event "witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller",
- \( W_1^- \) as the event "witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm",
- \( W_2^+ \) as the event "witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm",
- \( W_2^- \) as the event "witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller".

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H_+) = 0.15 \),
- \( P(H_-) = 0.85 \),
- \( P(W_1^+ | H_+) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1^- | H_+) = 0.2 \),
- \( P(W_1^+ | H_-) = 0.2 \), \( P(W_1^- | H_-) = 0.8 \),
- \( P(W_2^+ | H_+) = 0.3 \), \( P(W_2^- | H_+) = 0.7 \),
- \( P(W_2^+ | H_-) = 0.7 \), \( P(W_2^- | H_-) = 0.3 \).

To find the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (ignoring the second witness for now), we use:
\[ P(H_+ | W_1^+) = \frac{P(W_1^+ | H_+) \cdot P(H_+)}{P(W_1^+)} \]
where
\[ P(W_1^+) = P(W_1^+ | H_+) \cdot P(H_+) + P(W_1^+ | H_-) \cdot P(H_-) \]
\[ = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now calculating \( P(H_+ | W_1^+) \):
\[ P(H_+ | W_1^+) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, considering only the testimony of the first witness and the given population statistics, there is approximately a 41.38% probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Consequently, in the required format:

{probability: 0.4138}
