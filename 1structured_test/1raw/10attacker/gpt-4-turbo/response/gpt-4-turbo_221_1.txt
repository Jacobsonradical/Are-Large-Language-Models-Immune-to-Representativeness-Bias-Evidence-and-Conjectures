To solve this question, we need to calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, using Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \bar{A} \) denote the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 
- \( W1 \) denote the statement from Witness 1 that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) denote the statement from Witness 2 that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the data we know:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\bar{A}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know the reliability of each witness:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and someone as shorter than 185 cm 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and someone as 185 cm or taller 30% of the time.

Thus,
- \( P(W1|A) = 0.8 \) (probability Witness 1 is correct given the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|\bar{A}) = 0.2 \) (probability Witness 1 is wrong given the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2|A) = 0.3 \) (probability Witness 2 is wrong given the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2|\bar{A}) = 0.7 \) (probability Witness 2 is correct given the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to calculate \( P(A|W1, W2) \) using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|A)P(A)}{P(W1, W2)}
\]

Using the total probability theorem:
\[
P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|A)P(A) + P(W1, W2|\bar{A})P(\bar{A})
\]
with
\[
P(W1, W2|A) = P(W1|A) P(W2|A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W1, W2|\bar{A}) = P(W1|\bar{A}) P(W2|\bar{A}) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

So,
\[
P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

So,
\[
P(A|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements is approximately 0.232.

Result:
{probability: 0.232}
