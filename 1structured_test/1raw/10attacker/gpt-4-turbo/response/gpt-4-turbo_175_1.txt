To solve this problem, we will apply Bayesian probability theory. We need to update our belief about the attacker's height in light of the evidence from the witnesses. Let:

- \( H \) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) \), or the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), or the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.

The performance of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time. Thus:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller)
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time. Thus:
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both the witness observations.

Using Bayes' theorem and the assumption of witness independence:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H)P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H)P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately 0.2323.
