To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian statistics to update our prior beliefs based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses. We begin by defining:

- \( P(T) \) as the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(S) \) as the probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W_1|T) \) as the probability the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_1|S) \) as the probability the first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W_2|T) \) as the probability the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(W_2|S) \) as the probability the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm.

Given the information:
- \( P(T) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(S) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter)
- \( P(W_1|T) = 0.8 \) (First witness accuracy if taller)
- \( P(W_1|S) = 0.2 \) (First witness inaccuracy if shorter)
- \( P(W_2|T) = 0.3 \) (Second witness inaccuracy if taller)
- \( P(W_2|S) = 0.7 \) (Second witness accuracy if shorter)

Apply Bayes' theorem and probability of total evidence to find:
- \( P(T|W_1) \), the probability the attacker is tall given the first witness's claim:
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|T) \times P(T)}{P(W_1)} \]
where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker is tall:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|T) \times P(T) + P(W_1|S) \times P(S) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)= 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus,
\[ P(T|W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, based on the assessment of the first witness, the probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Formatted answer is:
{probability: 0.414}
