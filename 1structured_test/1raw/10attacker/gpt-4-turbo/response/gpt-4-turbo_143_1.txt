To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(E|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence combining the witness testimonies.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 0.15.
- \( P(E|A) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

We know from the information provided:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) where \( A^c \) is the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- The first witness (Witness 1) is correct 80% of the time if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, and incorrect 20% of the time if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Thus, \( P(W_1 = T | A) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 = T | A^c) = 0.2 \).
- The second witness (Witness 2) is correct 70% of the time if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, and incorrect 30% of the time if the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Thus, \( P(W_2 = F | A) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 = F | A^c) = 0.7 \).

Given that the witnesses give contradictory evidence (Witness 1 says the attacker is taller, Witness 2 says shorter), we need to evaluate:

\[ P(E) = P(W_1 = T, W_2 = F) \]
\[ P(E) = P(W_1 = T, W_2 = F | A)P(A) + P(W_1 = T, W_2 = F | A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (P(W_1 = T | A) \cdot P(W_2 = F | A)) \cdot P(A) + (P(W_1 = T | A^c) \cdot P(W_2 = F | A^c)) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.8 \cdot 0.3) \cdot 0.15 + (0.2 \cdot 0.7) \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now applying Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(A|E) = \frac{P(W_1 = T | A) \cdot P(W_2 = F | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(A|E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.2323}
