To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis given new evidence:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E|H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the initial probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \): the testimonies by the first witness and the second witness, respectively.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of people are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of people are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) (Probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|\overline{H}) = 0.2 \) (Probability witness 1 incorrectly judges height as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) (Probability witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2|\overline{H}) = 0.7 \) (Probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter)

We can use the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1) \) and \( P(W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|H)P(H) + P(W_1|\overline{H})P(\overline{H}) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(W_2) = P(W_2|H)P(H) + P(W_2|\overline{H})P(\overline{H}) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H)P(H)}{P(W_1)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

\[ P(H|W_2) = \frac{P(W_2|H)P(H)}{P(W_2)} = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.64} \approx \frac{0.045}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

Accumulating this information together (dependently or independently adjusting):
\[ P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
Assuming independence of witness testimonies:
\[ P(W_1, W_2|H) = P(W_1|H)P(W_2|H) \approx 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2|\overline{H})P(\overline{H}) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2|\overline{H}) = P(W_1|\overline{H})P(W_2|\overline{H}) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]
\[ P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Final estimated probability from the evidence of two witnesses:
\[ \{probability: 0.2323\} \]
This accounts for the likelihood based on both witness statements, treating them as independent evidences.
