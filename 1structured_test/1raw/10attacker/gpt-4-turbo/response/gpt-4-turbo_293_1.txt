To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to determine the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses. Let's denote:

- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) as the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 perceived the attacker to be 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 perceived the attacker to be less than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies cases of height 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability of first witness wrongly saying someone is 185 cm or taller when they aren't)
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly recognizing someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Probability of second witness wrongly saying someone is shorter than 185 cm when they aren't)

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2) \). Using Bayes' theorem, where \( P(W_1, W_2) \) is the probability of both witnesses' testimonies regardless of the attacker's actual height:

\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Here, \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) P(W_2 | A) \) due to assumed independence of witness reports given the height:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

Similarly,
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | A^c) = P(W_1 | A^c) P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Therefore, the probability of both witness testimonies occurring is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | A^c) P(A^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, plugging these into Bayes' theorem, we get:
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} â‰ˆ 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness accounts, is about 0.232 or 23.2%.

Therefore, the required estimate is: {probability: 0.232}
