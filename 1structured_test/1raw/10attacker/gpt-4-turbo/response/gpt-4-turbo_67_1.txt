To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps us update our prior belief based on new evidence. Let:

- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies tall individuals 80% of the time)
4. \( P(W_1|L) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies short individuals as tall 20% of the time)
5. \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies tall individuals as short 30% of the time)
6. \( P(W_2|L) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies short individuals 70% of the time)

We want to find \( P(H|W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is tall given the first witnessâ€™s statement.

Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1|H) \times P(H) + P(W_1|L) \times P(L) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus:

\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately:
