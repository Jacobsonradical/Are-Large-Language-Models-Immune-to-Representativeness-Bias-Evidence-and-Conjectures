To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. Let's denote:
- **H** as the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- **W1** as the event that Witness 1 testifies the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- **W2** as the event that Witness 2 testifies the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H|W1 \cap W2) \), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From the information given:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) and incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter, so \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, so \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.7 \) and incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time when they are actually taller, so \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \).

By Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | H)P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | H) = P(W1|H) P(W2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H) = P(W1|\neg H) P(W2|\neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now calculate \( P(W1 \cap W2) \):
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2 | H)P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given both the testimonies, is approximately 0.232.
