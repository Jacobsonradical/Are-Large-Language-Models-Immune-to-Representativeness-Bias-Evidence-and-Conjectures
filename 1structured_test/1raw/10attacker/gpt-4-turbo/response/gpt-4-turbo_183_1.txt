To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[
\text{P}(T \mid E) = \frac{\text{P}(E \mid T) \cdot \text{P}(T)}{\text{P}(E)}
\]

Where:
- \( T \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses.
- \( \text{P}(T \mid E) \) is the probability of \( T \) given \( E \).
- \( \text{P}(E \mid T) \) is the probability of observing \( E \) given \( T \).
- \( \text{P}(T) \) is the prior probability of \( T \), before considering the witnesses.
- \( \text{P}(E) \) is the total probability of observing \( E \).

Based on given data:
- \( \text{P}(T) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( \text{P}(T^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

\( E \) happens in two scenarios:
1. \( E1 \): First witness says attacker is 185 cm or taller, which happens with probability 0.8 if true, probability 0.2 if false.
2. \( E2 \): Second witness says attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which happens with probability 0.7 if true, probability 0.3 if false.

We aggregate these into the total probability of \( E \), given whether \( T \) (attacker is 185 cm or taller) or \( T^c \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
- \( \text{P}(E \mid T) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( \text{P}(E \mid T^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now, we calculate \( \text{P}(E) \), which is the total probability for \( E \):
\[
\text{P}(E) = (\text{P}(E \mid T) \cdot \text{P}(T)) + (\text{P}(E \mid T^c) \cdot \text{P}(T^c)) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[
\text{P}(T \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, based on the information and the accuracy of the witnesses:
{probability: 0.232}
