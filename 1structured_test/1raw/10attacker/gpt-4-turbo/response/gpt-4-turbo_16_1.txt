To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller considering both witness testimonies, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \(H\) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. 

1. **Prior probability \(\mathbb{P}(H)\)**:
   Given: 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
   \[\mathbb{P}(H) = 0.15\]

2. **Prior probability of not-\(H\) \(\mathbb{P}(\text{not-}H)\)**:
   Given: 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
   \[\mathbb{P}(\text{not-}H) = 0.85\]

Witness accuracies:
- Witness 1: 80% accuracy if the person is actually as they judge. Errors in 20% of the cases.
- Witness 2: 70% accuracy.

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - Probability that Witness 1 reports \(H\) given \(H\) is true: \(\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports } H \mid H) = 0.8\)
   - Probability that Witness 1 reports not-\(H\) erroneously (given \(H\)): \(\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports not-}H \mid H) = 0.2\)
   - Probability that Witness 2 reports \(H\) erroneously (given not-\(H\)): \(\mathbb{P}(\text{W2 reports } H \mid \text{not-}H) = 0.3\)
   - Probability that Witness 2 reports not-\(H\) if not-\(H\) is true: \(\mathbb{P}(\text{W2 reports not-}H \mid \text{not-}H) = 0.7\)

4. **Combined likelihood**:
   We use these probabilities to determine the joint probability of the witnesses' reports given \(H\) and not-\(H\):
   - Probability of Witness 1 reporting \(H\) and Witness 2 reporting not-\(H\) given \(H\): 
   \[\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports } H \text{ and W2 reports not-}H \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16\]
   - Probability of Witness 1 reporting \(H\) and Witness 2 reporting not-\(H\) given not-\(H\):
   \[\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports } H \text{ and W2 reports not-}H \mid \text{not-}H) = 0.3 \times 0.7 = 0.21\]

5. **Using Bayes' Theorem**:
   \[
   \mathbb{P}(H \mid \text{W1 reports H, W2 reports not-H}) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports H and W2 reports not-H} \mid H) \times \mathbb{P}(H)}{\mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports H and W2 reports not-H} \mid H) \times \mathbb{P}(H) + \mathbb{P}(\text{W1 reports H and W2 reports not-H} \mid \text{not-}H) \times \mathbb{P}(\text{not-}H)}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   \mathbb{P}(H \mid \text{W1 reports H, W2 reports not-}H) = \frac{0.16 \times 0.15}{(0.16 \times 0.15) + (0.21 \times 0.85)} = \frac{0.024}{0.024 + 0.1785} \approx 0.1186
   \]

   This means that, given the conflicting testimonies and their respective accuracies, there is approximately a **11.86% chance** that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Thus, the probability assessment based on the given conditions would be:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.1186 \}
\]
