To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnessed claims and their accuracy, we use Bayes' theorem, which expresses the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let,
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height to be 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height to be shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1's accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (probability Witness 1 correctly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (probability Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a person as 185 cm or taller)

Witness 2's accuracy:
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (probability Witness 2 correctly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (probability Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a person as shorter than 185 cm)

We seek \( P(A | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so. By Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)}
\]

However, we use the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1) \):

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1 | A^c) \cdot P(A^c) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting these values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the claim of Witness 1, is approximately 0.414 or 41.4%.
