To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' claims, we can use Bayesian probability.

First, let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(H^c) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 85% or 0.85.
- \( P(E_1|H) \) (probability that witness 1 correctly identifies taller individuals) = 80% or 0.80.
- \( P(E_1|H^c) \) (probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller) = 20% or 0.20.
- \( P(E_2|H) \) (probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter) = 30% or 0.30.
- \( P(E_2|H^c) \) (probability that witness 2 correctly identifies shorter individuals) = 70% or 0.70.

The event \( E \) of witness observations can be considered the intersection \( E_1 \cap E_2 \). We want to find \( P(H|E) \), the probability of the attacker being taller than 185 cm given the testimony of both witnesses.

Using Bayes' theorem and the formula for total probability, we have:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where:
\[
P(E|H) = P(E_1|H) P(E_2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(E|H^c) = P(E_1|H^c) P(E_2|H^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(E) = P(E|H) P(H) + P(E|H^c) P(H^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]
Thus:
\[
P(H|E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
