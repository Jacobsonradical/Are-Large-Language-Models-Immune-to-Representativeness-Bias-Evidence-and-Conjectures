To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability estimate for a hypothesis based on additional evidence. Here is how to proceed:

1. **Define the probabilities:**
   - Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the initial belief before evidence) that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. From the data, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
   - \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that the height is shorter than 185 cm, or \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

2. **Define the evidence probabilities:**
   - The first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let \( E_1 \) represent this evidence.
   - The accuracy of the first witness is 80% if the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, so \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.8 \).
   - The accuracy of the first witness is 20% incorrect if the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, which means he incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time, so \( P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
   
3. **Apply Bayes' theorem:**
   \[
   P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(E_1)}
   \]
   Where \( P(E_1) \) is the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
   \[
   P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
          = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
          = 0.12 + 0.17
          = 0.29
   \]
   Plugging these into Bayes' theorem gives:
   \[
   P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
