To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem to update our prior belief about the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimonies. 

Denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Accuracies of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies 
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (80% correct if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (20% incorrect if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm; i.e., saying taller when they are not)
- Witness 2 correctly identifies
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (30% incorrect; saying shorter when they are actually taller)
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (70% correct if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to compute \( P(H | W_1 \text{ and } W_2) \) using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness testimonies is approximately 0.232.
