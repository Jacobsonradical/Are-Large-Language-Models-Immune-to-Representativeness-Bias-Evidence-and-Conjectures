To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event where the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event where the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness accuracies:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (The probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (The probability that the first witness falsely identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (The probability that the second witness incorrectly says someone 185 cm or taller is shorter)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (The probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

We need to compute \( P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \):

\[ P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) \) is the probability that witness 1 is correct and witness 2 is incorrect, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller: \( P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \).
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | \neg H) \) is the probability that witness 1 is incorrect and witness 2 is correct, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm: \( P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \).

Using total probability for denominator,
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.051 = 0.087 \]

Finally, using Bayes' theorem,
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.087} = \frac{0.036}{0.087} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting witness statements, is approximately 0.414. Formatted as requested:
