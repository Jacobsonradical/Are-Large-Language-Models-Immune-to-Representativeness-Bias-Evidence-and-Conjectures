To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( A \) represent the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) represent the events that the first and second witness, respectively, claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   \[ P(A) = 0.15 \quad \text{(15% are 185 cm or taller)} \]
   \[ P(A^c) = 0.85 \quad \text{(85% are shorter than 185 cm)} \]

2. **Accuracy of witnesses**:
   - **First witness (\( B_1 \))**:
     \[ P(B_1 | A) = 0.80 \quad \text{(80% of the time correctly identifies >=185 cm)} \]
     \[ P(B_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \quad \text{(20% of the time incorrectly says >=185 cm when <185 cm)} \]
   - **Second witness (\( B_2 \))**:
     \[ P(B_2^c | A) = 0.30 \quad \text{(30% of the time incorrectly says <185 cm when >=185 cm)} \]
     \[ P(B_2^c | A^c) = 0.70 \quad \text{(70% of the time correctly identifies <185 cm)} \]

3. **Calculating the probability**:
   We wish to find \( P(A | B_1 \cap B_2^c) \) - probability attacker is >=185 cm given first witness says >=185 cm, and second contradicts.
   \[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2^c) = \frac{P(B_1 \cap B_2^c | A) P(A)}{P(B_1 \cap B_2^c)} \]

   Calculate the joint probabilities:
   \[ P(B_1 \cap B_2^c | A) = P(B_1 | A) P(B_2^c | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
   \[ P(B_1 \cap B_2^c | A^c) = P(B_1 | A^c) P(B_2^c | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

   Marginal probability of \( B_1 \cap B_2^c \):
   \[ P(B_1 \cap B_2^c) = P(B_1 \cap B_2^c | A) P(A) + P(B_1 \cap B_2^c | A^c) P(A^c) \]
   \[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

   Plugging into Bayesâ€™ Theorem:
   \[ P(A | B_1 \cap B_2^c) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given the testimonies of both witnesses, is approximately **0.232 (23.2%)**.
