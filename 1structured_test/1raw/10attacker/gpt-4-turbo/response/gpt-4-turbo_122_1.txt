To answer this question, we utilize Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) in light of new evidence (witness's statements).

1. **Prior Probability (P Tall)**:
   The probability that a randomly picked person from the population is 185 cm or taller is given as 15%, or 0.15.

2. **Probability Not Tall (P Short)**:
   Conversely, the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.

3. **Witness's Accuracy (P(Witness | Height))**:
   - **First Witness**: Correctly identifies a person 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (True Positive), and incorrectly identifies a shorter person as tall 20% of the time (False Positive).
   - **Second Witness**: Correctly identifies a person shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (True Negative), and incorrectly identifies a taller person as short 30% of the time (False Negative).

We want to compute the probability that a person is tall given both witnesses' testimonies using the formula: 
\[ P(Tall | Witnesses) = \frac{P(Witnesses | Tall) \times P(Tall)}{P(Witnesses)} \]

Here, **P(Witnesses | Tall)** (likelihood of both witnesses' statements if the person is indeed tall) and **P(Witnesses | Short)** (if the person is not tall) are calculated as follows:
- When the person is tall: Probability that the first witness says tall * Probability that the second witness says not tall,
  \( (0.8) \times (0.3) \)

- When the person is not tall: Probability that the first witness says tall * Probability that the second witness says not tall,
  \( (0.2) \times (0.7) \)

Therefore:
- **P(Witnesses | Tall)** = \( 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- **P(Witnesses | Short)** = \( 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Finally, **P(Witnesses)** - the total probability of witness claims occurring - is computed by:
\[ P(Witnesses) = P(Witnesses | Tall) \times P(Tall) + P(Witnesses | Short) \times P(Short) \]
\[ P(Witnesses) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(Witnesses) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(Tall | Witnesses) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(Tall | Witnesses) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately:

{probability: 0.23226}
