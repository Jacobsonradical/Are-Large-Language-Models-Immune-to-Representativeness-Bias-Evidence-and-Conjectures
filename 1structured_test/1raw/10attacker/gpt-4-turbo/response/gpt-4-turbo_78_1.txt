To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. Our prior belief here is that the probability \( P(H) \) of the attacker being 185 cm or taller is 15%, or 0.15, based on the information about the population. Conversely, the probability \( P(L) \) of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or 0.85.

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller with an accuracy of 80% (\( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)), while misidentifying shorter individuals 20% of the time as taller (\( P(W_1 | L) = 0.20 \)).

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter, with an accuracy of 70% (\( P(W_2 | L) = 0.70 \)), and incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter 30% of the time (\( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)).

We need \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of the witnesses. Using Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability:

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H)
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | L) = P(W_1 | L) P(W_2 | L)
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | L) P(L)
\]

Now, plugging in the values:
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2 | L) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14
\]
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 * 0.15}{0.155} ≈ \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, reconciling the conflicting witness reports using the accuracies specified, is approximately 0.232. 

So, formatted as requested:
