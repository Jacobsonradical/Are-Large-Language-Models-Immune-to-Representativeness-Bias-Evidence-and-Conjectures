To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let \(H\) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. We know:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H^c) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also know about the witnesses' abilities to correctly judge the height:
- Witness 1 has an 80% accuracy to correctly identify someone's height, i.e., \(P(D_1|H) = 0.80\) and \(P(D_1|H^c) = 0.20\), where \(D_1\) is the event that Witness 1 correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Witness 2 has a 70% accuracy to correctly judge someone's height, i.e., \(P(D_2^c|H) = 0.30\) and \(P(D_2^c|H^c) = 0.70\), where \(D_2^c\) is the event that Witness 2 incorrectly claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need to find \(P(H|D_1, D_2^c)\), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 says the attacker was 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 says the attacker was shorter.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|D_1, D_2^c) = \frac{P(D_1, D_2^c|H) P(H)}{P(D_1, D_2^c)}
\]

Where:
\[
P(D_1, D_2^c|H) = P(D_1|H) \times P(D_2^c|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(D_1, D_2^c|H^c) = P(D_1|H^c) \times P(D_2^c|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Using the law of total probability, we find \(P(D_1, D_2^c)\):
\[
P(D_1, D_2^c) = P(D_1, D_2^c|H) P(H) + P(D_1, D_2^c|H^c) P(H^c) = (0.24)(0.15) + (0.14)(0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Then:
\[
P(H|D_1, D_2^c) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

After correctly computing the values:
\[
P(H|D_1, D_2^c) = \frac{P(D_1|H) \times P(D_2^c|H) \times P(H)}{P(D_1|H) \times P(D_2^c|H) \times P(H) + P(D_1|H^c) \times P(D_2^c|H^c) \times P(H^c)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, \(P(H|D_1, D_2^c) \approx 0.232\).
