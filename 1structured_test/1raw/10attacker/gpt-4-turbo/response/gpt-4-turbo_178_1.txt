Let's break down the problem using probabilities and Bayes' theorem.

1. **Notations:**  
   Let \(A\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  
   Let \(A^c\) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.  
   Let \(W_1\) be the event that the first witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller.  
   Let \(W_2\) be the event that the second witness testifies the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given Probabilities:**  
   \(\Pr(A) = 0.15\)  (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)  
   \(\Pr(A^c) = 0.85\)  (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Witness Accuracies:**  
   - First Witness:  
     \(\Pr(W_1 | A) = 0.8\)  (80% accurate if the attacker is 185 cm or taller)  
     \(\Pr(W_1 | A^c) = 0.2\)  (20% chance of mistakenly saying attacker is 185 cm or taller if they are not)
   - Second Witness:  
     \(\Pr(W_2 | A^c) = 0.7\)  (70% accurate if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)  
     \(\Pr(W_2 | A) = 0.3\)  (30% chance of mistakenly saying attacker is shorter than 185 cm if they are not)

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem:**  
   We want to compute \(\Pr(A | W_1)\):
   \[
   \Pr(A | W_1) = \frac{\Pr(W_1 | A) \Pr(A)}{\Pr(W_1)}
   \]
   Here, \(\Pr(W_1)\) (the probability that the first witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
   \[
   \Pr(W_1) = \Pr(W_1 | A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(W_1 | A^c) \Pr(A^c)
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \Pr(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]
   So,
   \[
   \Pr(A | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of the first witness, is approximately:
   \{
   "probability": 0.4138
   \}
