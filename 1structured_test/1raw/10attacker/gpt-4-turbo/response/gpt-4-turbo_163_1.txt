To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to update our belief about the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the witness statements. Let:
- \( H \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( \neg H \) be the event "attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \( W_1 \) be the event "first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( W_2 \) be the event "second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"

Given from the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (first witness correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (first witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (second witness correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

We need to calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \).

Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H)P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H)P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Since the question specifically asks about the probability after just the first witness's observation:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
Where:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, according to the first witness's claim, is 0.414.
