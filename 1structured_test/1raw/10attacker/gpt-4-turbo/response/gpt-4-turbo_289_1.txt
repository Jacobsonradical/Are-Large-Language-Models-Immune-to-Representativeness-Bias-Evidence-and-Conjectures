To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- \( L \) as the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm,
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller,
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% is shorter than 185 cm)
- The probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given they truly are that tall, \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \); Incorrectly identifies them as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W_1 | L) = 0.2 \)
- The probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given they truly are that short, \( P(W_2 | L) = 0.7 \); Incorrectly identifies them as shorter, \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \)

The probability we want to find is \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 said so. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | L) \times P(L) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging in the values to Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the claim of the first witness, is about 0.4138.
