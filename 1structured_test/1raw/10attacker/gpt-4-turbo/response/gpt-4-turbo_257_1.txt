To solve this problem, we utilize Bayesian probability, taking the given percentages of the population distribution and the witnesses' accuracy into account.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) and \( W2 \) as the statements from witness 1 and witness 2, respectively, about the attacker's height.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.8 \) (witness 1 accuracy if attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (witness 1 error rate if attacker is shorter),
- \( P(W2 | H) = 0.3 \) (witness 2 error rate if attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (witness 2 accuracy if attacker is shorter).

Our target is to find \( P(H | W1) \) - the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given witness 1's claim.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H) P(H)}{P(W1)} \]
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H) P(H) + P(W1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.
