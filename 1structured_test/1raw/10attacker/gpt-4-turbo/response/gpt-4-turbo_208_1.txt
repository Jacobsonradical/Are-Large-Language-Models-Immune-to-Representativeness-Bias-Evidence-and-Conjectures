To calculate the probability that the attacker’s height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes’ theorem. Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( \overline{H} \) the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

We also need to consider the witnesses' abilities to correctly identify whether someone is 185 cm or taller or not.

Let \( W1 \) represent the event that witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height, and similarly \( W2 \) for witness 2:
- Witness 1 has a 80% success rate: \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \), \( P(W1|\overline{H}) = 0.2 \) 
- Witness 2 has a 70% success rate: \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \), \( P(W2|\overline{H}) = 0.7 \)

We need to find \( P(H|W1 \cap \overline{W2}) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed the attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 2 claimed otherwise.

Using Bayes' rule and the law of total probability, we first find \( P(W1 \cap \overline{W2}) \) (the probability of witness 1's claim intersecting with the opposite of witness 2’s claim):
\[ P(W1 \cap \overline{W2}) = P(W1|H)P(\overline{W2}|H)P(H) + P(W1|\overline{H})P(\overline{W2}|\overline{H})P(\overline{H}) \]
\[ = (0.8)(0.7)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.3)(0.85) \]
\[ = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W1 \cap \overline{W2}) = \frac{P(W1|H)P(\overline{W2}|H)P(H)}{P(W1 \cap \overline{W2})} \]
\[ = \frac{(0.8)(0.7)(0.15)}{0.135} \]
\[ = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.622.
