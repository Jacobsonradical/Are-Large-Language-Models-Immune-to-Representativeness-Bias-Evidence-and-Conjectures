To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the two witnesses' statements and their accuracy rates, we will use Bayes' theorem. 

Let \( A \) denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. Let \( B_1 \) represent the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and \( B_2 \) the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (or 15%).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85 (or 85%).

Given \( A \) (attacker is 185 cm or taller):
- \( P(B_1 \mid A) \) (probability that first witness correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(B_2 \mid A) \) (probability that second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm) = 0.30.

Given \( \neg A \) (attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
- \( P(B_1 \mid \neg A) \) (probability that first witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20.
- \( P(B_2 \mid \neg A) \) (probability that second witness correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm) = 0.70.

We seek \( P(A \mid B_1, B_2) \), and by Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[
P(A \mid B_1, B_2) = \frac{P(B_1 \mid A) P(B_2 \mid A) P(A)}{P(B_1, B_2)}
\]
where
\[
P(B_1, B_2) = P(B_1 \mid A) P(B_2 \mid A) P(A) + P(B_1 \mid \neg A) P(B_2 \mid \neg A) P(\neg A)
\]
\[
= 0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85
\]
\[
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
\]
\[
= 0.036 + 0.119
\]
\[
= 0.155
\]

Thus,
\[
P(A \mid B_1, B_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability, based on the witness statements and their assessed accuracies that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.
