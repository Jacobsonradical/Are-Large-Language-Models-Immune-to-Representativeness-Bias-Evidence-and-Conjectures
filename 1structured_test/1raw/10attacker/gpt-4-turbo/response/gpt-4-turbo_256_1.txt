To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on additional evidence. Let's denote \(H\) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \(W_1\) and \(W_2\) as the witnesses' claims that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm, respectively. 

The prior probability \( P(H) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is given as 15%, or \( 0.15 \). The probability \( P(\neg H) \) that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85%, or \( 0.85 \).

From the data:
- The first witness, who said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, identifies correctly 80% of the time when the person is actually 185 cm or taller (true positive rate, \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)) and incorrectly identifies as taller 20% of the time when the person is actually shorter (false positive rate, \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)).
- The second witness, who said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, identifies correctly 70% of the time when the person is actually shorter (true positive rate, \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)) and incorrectly identifies as shorter 30% of the time when the person is actually taller (false positive rate, \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)).

We need to compute \( P(H | W_1) \) using Bayesian updating:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is taller:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so, is approximately 0.414.

Therefore, the answer in the desired format is:
{probability: 0.414}
