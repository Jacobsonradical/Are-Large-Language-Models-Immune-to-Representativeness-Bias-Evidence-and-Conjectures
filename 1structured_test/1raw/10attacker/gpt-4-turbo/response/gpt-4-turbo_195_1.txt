To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies of two witnesses and the population height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller,
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness testifies the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we have:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm),
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time),
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time),
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time),
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time).

To find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies, we use Bayes' theorem in a joint probability form:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \):
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now, calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, calculate \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232258 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.23. 

Therefore, the required probability is:
**{probability: 0.232258}**
