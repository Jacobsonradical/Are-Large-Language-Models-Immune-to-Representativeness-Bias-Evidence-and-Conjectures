To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem. Let:
- \(H\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(L\) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(A\) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(B\) be the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(L) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness accuracy:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

From these probabilities, we know:
- \(P(A|H) = 0.80\) (probability Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(A|L) = 0.20\) (probability Witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(B|L) = 0.70\) (probability Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \(P(B|H) = 0.30\) (probability Witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' theorem, to find \(P(H|A)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so:
\[
P(H|A) = \frac{P(A|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(A)}
\]
where \(P(A)\) (probability Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) is:
\[
P(A) = P(A|H) \cdot P(H) + P(A|L) \cdot P(L) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Calculating \(P(H|A)\):
\[
P(H|A) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, based on Witness 1's account alone:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.4138 \}
\]
