To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem in general form is:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

Let:
- \( A \) be the event the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) be the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 accurately assesses the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 inaccurately assesses the attacker's height.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 accurately assesses the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( \neg W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 inaccurately assesses the attacker's height.

From the problem statement:
- \( P(A) \) (Probability that a person is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(\neg A) \) (Probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.
- \( P(W_1|A) \) (Probability Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
- \( P(W_1|\neg A) \) (Probability Witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2.
- \( P(W_2|A) \) (Probability Witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3.
- \( P(W_2|\neg A) \) (Probability Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7.

We need to find \( P(A|W_1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using total probability theorem:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|A) \times P(A) + P(W_1|\neg A) \times P(\neg A) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' equation:

\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the claim of the first witness, is approximately 0.4138.
