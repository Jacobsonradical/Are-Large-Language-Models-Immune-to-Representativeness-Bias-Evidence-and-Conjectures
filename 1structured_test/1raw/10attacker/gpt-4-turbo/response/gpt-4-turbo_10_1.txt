To solve this, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in its simplest form is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller).
- \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability of the hypothesis given the evidence.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.

### Step 1: Define the probabilities
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

### Step 2: Assess the witnesses' reliability
- First witness accuracy:
  - \( P(E1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
  - \( P(E1 \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \) (incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
  
- Second witness accuracy:
  - \( P(E2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
  - \( P(E2 \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \) (correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

### Step 3: Calculate the probability of the evidence \( P(E) \)
- \( P(E) \) is calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E1, E2 \mid H) P(H) + P(E1, E2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (P(E1 \mid H)P(E2 \mid H)) P(H) + (P(E1 \mid \neg H)P(E2 \mid \neg H)) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = (0.80 \times 0.30) \times 0.15 + (0.20 \times 0.70) \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(E) = 0.155 \]

### Step 4: Calculate \( P(H \mid E) \) using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E1, E2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{(0.80 \times 0.30) \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = 0.23226 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately **0.23226**.
