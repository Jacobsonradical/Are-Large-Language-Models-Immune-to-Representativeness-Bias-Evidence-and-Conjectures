To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the statements of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \(A\) represents the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) represents the evidence provided by the two witnesses.
- \(P(A)\) is the prior probability of \(A\) (the attacker is 185 cm or taller), which according to information "b", is 15% or 0.15.
- \(P(E \mid A)\) is the probability of observing the evidence \(E\) given \(A\) (if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(E)\) is the total probability of observing the evidence.

As specified:
- The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and is correct 80% of the time.
- The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and is correct 70% of the time.

Calculating \(P(E \mid A)\) (probability of witnessing evidence if the attacker is 185 cm or taller):
\[ P(E \mid A) = P(\text{Witness 1 is correct}) \cdot P(\text{Witness 2 is incorrect}) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24. \]

Calculating \(P(E \mid A^c)\) (probability of witnessing evidence if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
\[ P(E \mid A^c) = P(\text{Witness 1 is incorrect}) \cdot P(\text{Witness 2 is correct}) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14. \]

\(P(A^c)\) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.

Now, calculate the total probability of \(E\):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(E \mid A^c) \cdot P(A^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155. \]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability \(P(A \mid E)\) is:
\[ P(A \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23225. \]

Therefore, the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.23225.
