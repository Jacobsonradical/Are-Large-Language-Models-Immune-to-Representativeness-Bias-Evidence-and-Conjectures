To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness accounts, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Prior Probability (\(P(T)\))**: Probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller (from the city's population statistics) is 15% or 0.15.

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Witness 1 (W1)** claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time. So, the probability that W1 correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller when they are indeed that tall is \(P(W_1|T) = 0.80\). Conversely, W1 wrongly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are actually shorter. So, \( P(W_1|T^c) = 0.20 \).
   - **Witness 2 (W2)** claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time. Hence, the probability that W2 wrongly identifies someone as being shorter than 185 cm when they are actually taller is \(P(W_2|T) = 0.30\). Conversely, W2 correctly identifies someone as shorter 70% of the time when they are indeed shorter. So, \(P(W_2|T^c) = 0.70\).

3. **Total Probability of Witness Accounts (\(P(W_1, W_2)\))**, considering independence between W1's and W2's testimonies:

   \[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1|T) \cdot P(W_2|T) \cdot P(T) + P(W_1|T^c) \cdot P(W_2|T^c) \cdot P(T^c) \]
   \[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.70 \cdot 0.85 \]
   \[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. **Probability the Attacker is 185 cm or Taller Given Both Witnesses' Claims (\(P(T|W_1, W_2)\))**:

   \[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1|T) \cdot P(W_2|T) \cdot P(T)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]
   \[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.30 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \]
   \[ P(T|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, combining the witness statements with the known statistics about the population, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 0.232.
