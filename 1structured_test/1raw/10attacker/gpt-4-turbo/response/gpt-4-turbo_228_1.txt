To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem for conditional probabilities along with the provided data. Let:

- \(H\) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H^c\) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\) be the event that the first witness testifies that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) be the event that the second witness testifies that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the problem:
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 15% or 0.15.
- The complement, \(P(H^c)\), that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm is 85% or 0.85.

**Accuracy of Witnesses**:
- The first witness has an accuracy of 80% (or 0.8) when judging someone as 185 cm or taller. Thus, \(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8\) and \(P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2\) since he is wrong 20% of the times if the person is actually shorter.
- The second witness has an accuracy of 70% (or 0.7) when judging someone as shorter than 185 cm. Thus, \(P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7\) and \(P(W_2 | H) = 0.3\) given the witness is wrong 30% of the times when the individual is actually taller.

We want to estimate \(P(H | W_1)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claims so.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \(P(W_1)\) (the total probability that witness 1 will testify that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, regardless of true height) can be calculated by the Law of Total Probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, substituting back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

This evaluates to approximately 0.414. Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is about 41.4%.
