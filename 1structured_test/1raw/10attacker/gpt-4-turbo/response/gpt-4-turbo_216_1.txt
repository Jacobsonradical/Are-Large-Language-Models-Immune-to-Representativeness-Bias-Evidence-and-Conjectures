To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies and the known rates of accuracy of the two witnesses, as well as the city's height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem.

1. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. Let \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \( P(A) \), the probability an individual in the city is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability an individual is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85%).
- \( P(W_1|A) \), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(W_1|A^c) \), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone under 185 cm as 185 or taller = 0.2.
- \( P(W_2|A) \), the probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter = 0.3.
- \( P(W_2|A^c) \), the probability the second witness correctly identifies someone under 185 cm = 0.7.

We want to calculate \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2^c) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed they are and Witness 2 claimed they aren't.

First, using the total probability rule:
- \( P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A)P(A) + P(W_1 | A^c)P(A^c) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
- \( P(W_2^c) \) is the complement of \( P(W_2) \), so:
  - \( P(W_2) = P(W_2 | A)P(A) + P(W_2 | A^c)P(A^c) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \)
  - \( P(W_2^c) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36 \)

Next, we use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2^c | A)P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2^c)} \]

We already found \( P(A) = 0.15 \). 

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2^c | A) = P(W_1 | A)P(W_2^c | A) = 0.8 \times (1 - 0.3) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \]

Now, \( P(W_1 \cap W_2^c) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2^c) = P(W_1 \cap W_2^c | A)P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2^c | A^c)P(A^c) \]
\[ = 0.56 \times 0.15 + (0.2 \times (1 - 0.7) \times 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.2 \times 0.3 \times 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Thus:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2^c) = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Therefore, the final probability estimate is:
{probability: 0.622}
