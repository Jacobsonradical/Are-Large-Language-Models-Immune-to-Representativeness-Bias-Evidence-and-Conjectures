To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies and their respective accuracies, we apply Bayes' Theorem:

1. Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
2. Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the witnesses' claims that the attacker is taller than 185 cm and shorter than 185 cm, respectively.

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The accuracy rates of the witnesses give us:
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \) (Probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|\neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \) (Probability witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter)

We want to find \( P(H|W_1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claims so.

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]
Where \( P(W_1) \) (the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be found by the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1|H) \times P(H) + P(W_1|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) 
       = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 
       = 0.12 + 0.17 
       = 0.29
\]

Putting it back into Bayes' formula:
\[
P(H|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:
{ probability: 0.4138 }
