To answer the question, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the height of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the information given by the witnesses. 

Let:
- \( H \) be the event "the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( W_1 \) be the event "Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller".
- \( W_2 \) be the event "Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm".

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witnesses' accuracies are:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \).

We need to calculate \( P(H | W_1) \) and \( P(H | W_2^c) \) and then combine these probabilities to estimate the overall probability. However, since the question explicitly asks about the probability based solely on what the first witness claimed:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
where
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based only on the first witness' claim, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
