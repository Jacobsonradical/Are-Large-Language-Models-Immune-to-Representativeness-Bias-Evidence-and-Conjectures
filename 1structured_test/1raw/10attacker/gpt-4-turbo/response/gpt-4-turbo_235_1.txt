To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. 

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_1 \) as the event that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( B_2 \) as the event that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(\neg A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85 (85%).

We are given the probabilities of the witnesses correctly identifying the height:
- \( P(B_1 | A) \), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies taller people (as being 185 cm or taller), is 0.80.
- \( P(\neg B_1 | \neg A) \), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller, is 0.20.
- \( P(\neg B_2 | A) \), the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies taller people as shorter, is 0.30.
- \( P(B_2 | \neg A) \), the probability that the second witness correctly identifies shorter people, is 0.70.

Using Bayes' theorem and assuming independence between witnesses’ testimonies:
\[
P(A | B_1, \neg B_2) = \frac{P(B_1, \neg B_2 | A) P(A)}{P(B_1, \neg B_2)}
\]
\[
P(B_1, \neg B_2 | A) = P(B_1 | A)P(\neg B_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(B_1, \neg B_2 | \neg A) = P(B_1 | \neg A)P(\neg B_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now we compute \( P(B_1, \neg B_2) \):
\[
P(B_1, \neg B_2) = P(B_1, \neg B_2 | A)P(A) + P(B_1, \neg B_2 | \neg A)P(\neg A) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, plugging values back into Bayes’ theorem:
\[
P(A | B_1, \neg B_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.232.
