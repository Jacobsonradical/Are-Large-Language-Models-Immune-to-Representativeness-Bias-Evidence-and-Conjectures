To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We start by defining events:

- Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 
- Let \( B_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( B_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given in the problem:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- For Witness 1, who gets it right 80% of the time:
  - \( P(B_1 | A) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(B_1 | A^c) = 0.2 \)
- For Witness 2, who gets it right 70% of the time:
  - \( P(B_2 | A) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(B_2 | A^c) = 0.7 \)

Bayes' Theorem tells us:
\[ P(A | B_1) = \frac{P(B_1 | A) P(A)}{P(B_1)} \]
where
\[ P(B_1) = P(B_1 | A) P(A) + P(B_1 | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, plugging into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | B_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given what the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the formatted answer is:
{probability: 0.4138}
