To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, where we update our beliefs based on the evidence presented by the witness statements.

Let's denote the following:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15% of the population).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the complementary probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.
- \( P(A|H) \), the probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, provided they are indeed this tall, is 0.80.
- \( P(A|\neg H) \), the probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, provided they are not, is 0.20.
- \( P(B|H) \), the probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, provided they are indeed 185 cm or taller, is 0.30.
- \( P(B|\neg H) \), the probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, provided they are indeed shorter, is 0.70.

We seek \( P(H|A,B) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given both witness statements.

We can use the joint probability formula and Bayes' Theorem for this:
\[
P(H|A,B) = \frac{P(A,B|H) P(H)}{P(A,B)}
\]
Here, \( P(A,B|H) = P(A|H) P(B|H) \) since witness statements can be considered independent given the height of the attacker. Similarly, \( P(A,B|\neg H) = P(A|\neg H) P(B|\neg H) \).

\[
P(A,B|H) = P(A|H) P(B|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(A,B|\neg H) = P(A|\neg H) P(B|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Now, using total probability for \( P(A,B) \):
\[
P(A,B) = P(H) P(A,B|H) + P(\neg H) P(A,B|\neg H) = 0.15 \times 0.24 + 0.85 \times 0.14 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally, applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H|A,B) = \frac{P(A,B|H) P(H)}{P(A,B)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given both witness statements:
