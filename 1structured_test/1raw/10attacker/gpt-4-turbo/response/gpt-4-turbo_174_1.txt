To calculate the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the two witness statements and knowledge about the distribution of heights in the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:

- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{H} \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) (Witness 1) correctly states the attackerâ€™s height as "185 cm or taller".
- \( W_2 \) (Witness 2) incorrectly states the attacker's height as "shorter than 185 cm".

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1|\overline{H}) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time when attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time when attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2|\overline{H}) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Apply Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(W_2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|\overline{H}) = P(W_1|\overline{H}) \times P(W_2|\overline{H}) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

And the total probability of both witnesses' testimonies:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2|H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2|\overline{H}) P(\overline{H}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.2323.
