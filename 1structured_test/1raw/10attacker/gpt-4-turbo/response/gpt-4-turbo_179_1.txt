To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E \) is the evidence about the witness statements.

According to the data:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15 (or 15%)
- \( P(\neg H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85 (or 85%)

From witness data:
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) \) (the probability the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller) = 0.80
- \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \) (the probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller) = 0.20
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) \) (the probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter) = 0.30
- \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \) (the probability the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm) = 0.70

If \( E \) represents the event that witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and witness 2 says the attacker is shorter:
- \( P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid H) \)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \)

Calculating both:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using total probability theorem for \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements, is approximately 0.2323.
