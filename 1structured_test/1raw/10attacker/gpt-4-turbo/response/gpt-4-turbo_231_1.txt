To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can apply Bayesian statistics, based on the given information from the witnesses and the known distribution of population heights.

Let's set:
- \( H \) for the hypothesis that the attacker's height is \( \geq 185 \) cm.
- \( \neg H \) for the hypothesis that the attacker's height is \( < 185 \) cm.
- \( W_1 \) for the event where the first witness reports that the attacker's height is \( \geq 185 \) cm.
- \( W_2 \) for the event where the second witness reports that the attacker's height is \( < 185 \) cm.

From the provided information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population being 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population being shorter than 185 cm).
- The first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and errs 20% of the time, so \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
- The second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and errs 30% of the time, so \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \).

We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's report.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 claiming the height as \( \geq 185 \) cm:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
= 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
= 0.12 + 0.17
= 0.29
\]

Thus,
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29}
= \frac{0.12}{0.29}
\approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the Bayesian updated probability that the attackerâ€™s height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's observation, is roughly 0.4138.
