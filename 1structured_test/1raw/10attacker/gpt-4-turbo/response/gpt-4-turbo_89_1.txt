To solve the probability of the attacker's height being 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness statements and their respective accuracies, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let:
- \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) denote the observations made by the first and second witnesses, respectively.

The probability \( P(H) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is 0.15 (given by the provided data). Conversely, the probability \( P(\neg H) \) (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 0.85.

From the information given:
- The first witness, \( W_1 \), is correct 80% of the time. Thus, \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not).
- The second witness, \( W_2 \), is correct 70% of the time. Thus, \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (probability of the second witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that they are) and \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability of the second witness saying the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that they actually are taller).

Now applying Bayes' Theorem for the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \):

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Total probability of \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) (using the Law of Total Probability):
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
= 0.036 + 0.119
= 0.155
\]

Hence,
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232258
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given the statements and their accuracies, is approximately 0.2323.

Thus the answer in the required format is:

{probability: 0.2323}
