To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the provided information and the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem enables us to update our initial probability estimates based on new evidence.

1. Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
2. We have the prior probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \) since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
3. The complementary probability, \( P(\text{not } H) \), the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm, is \( 0.85 \) as 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

We also have the reliability of each witness:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 1 is wrong 20% of the time if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and correct 80% of the time.
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and wrong 30% of the time.
- Witness 2 is wrong 30% of the time if the attacker is 185 cm or taller and correct 70% of the time.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid \text{witness 1 says taller and witness 2 says shorter}) = \frac{P(\text{witness 1 says taller} \cap \text{witness 2 says shorter} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(\text{witness 1 says taller} \cap \text{witness 2 says shorter})} \]

Calculate the probability of witness statements given the hypothesis:
- \( P(\text{witness 1 says taller} \mid H) = 0.8 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 says shorter} \mid H) = 0.3 \) (opposite of being correct when taller)
- \( P(\text{witness 1 says taller} \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 says shorter} \mid \text{not } H) = 0.7 \)

Thus:
- \( P(\text{1 taller} \cap \text{2 shorter} \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(\text{1 taller} \cap \text{2 shorter} \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Using the Law of Total Probability for the denominator:
\[ P(\text{1 taller} \cap \text{2 shorter}) = P(\text{1 taller} \cap \text{2 shorter} \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(\text{1 taller} \cap \text{2 shorter} \mid \text{not } H) \cdot P(\text{not } H) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, the posterior probability \( P(H \mid \text{1 taller and 2 shorter}) \) is:
\[ \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting statements by the witnesses, is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
