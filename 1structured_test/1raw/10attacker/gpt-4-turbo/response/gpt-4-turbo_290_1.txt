To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( \neg H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the events that the first and second witnesses respectively claim the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller and shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Probability that a random person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (Probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 1’s accuracy \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Correct identification of height as 185 cm or taller)
- Witness 1's error \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Misidentification of someone shorter as taller)
- Witness 2’s accuracy \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Correct identification of height as shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 2’s error \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Misidentification of someone taller as shorter)

To use Bayes' theorem, we consider the combined witness statements:
- Probability Witness 1 is correct and Witness 2 is incorrect, thereby supporting that \( H \) is true \( (W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(\neg W_2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
- Probability Witness 1 is incorrect and Witness 2 is correct, supporting that \( \neg H \) is true \( (\neg W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(\neg W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(\neg W_1|\neg H) \times P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.80 \times 0.70 = 0.56 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
- \( P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2)} \)

Where \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being incorrect:
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.70 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

This probability indicates that given the conflicting witness statements, and their respective accuracies, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.2323.
