To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which can help us update our probability estimate for the height of the attacker based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let:
- \(H\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_1\) be the event that Witness 1 correctly states that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) be the event that Witness 2 correctly states that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(H^c) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Also given is that:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as being shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and incorrectly 30% of the time.

Thus:
- \(P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8\) (Probability Witness 1 is right given the attacker is tall)
- \(P(W_1 \mid H^c) = 0.2\) (Probability Witness 1 is wrong given the attacker is short)
- \(P(W_2 \mid H^c) = 0.7\) (Probability Witness 2 is right given the attacker is short)
- \(P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3\) (Probability Witness 2 is wrong given the attacker is tall)

We want to find \(P(H \mid W_1)\), the probability the attacker is tall given that Witness 1 claims he is.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

where \(P(W_1)\) is the total probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall, calculated as:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \mid H^c) \cdot P(H^c)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, plug in the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:
{probability: 0.4138}
