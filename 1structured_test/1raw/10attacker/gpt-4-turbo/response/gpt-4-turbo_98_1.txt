To determine the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (H), given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) is the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) is the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (15%).
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|H) \) is the probability of the first witness correctly identifying a tall person and the second witness incorrectly identifying a tall person.
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) is the overall probability that the first witness says the attacker was tall and the second witness says the attacker was short.

From the given information:
- \( P(W_1|H) \) = 80% (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they actually are).
- \( P(W_1|H^c) \) = 20% (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller when they are not).
- \( P(W_2|H) \) = 30% (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they are not).
- \( P(W_2|H^c) \) = 70% (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm when they actually are).

Calculate:
- The probability of \( W_1 \cap W_2 | H \) (first witness correct and second witness incorrect, given the attacker is tall):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1|H) \cdot P(W_2|H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]

- The probability of \( W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c \) (first witness incorrect and second witness correct, given the attacker is not tall):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1|H^c) \cdot P(W_2|H^c) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

- \( P(H^c) \) is 85% (complement of \( P(H) \)).
- Then calculate overall \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus:
{probability: 0.232}
