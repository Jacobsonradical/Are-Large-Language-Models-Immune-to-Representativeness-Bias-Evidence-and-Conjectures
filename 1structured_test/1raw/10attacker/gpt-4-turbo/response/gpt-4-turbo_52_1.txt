To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the information from two witness statements and known population statistics, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem relates the conditional probabilities and marginal probabilities of events.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly selected person from the population is 185 cm or taller, is 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85.

The witnesses' accuracies lead to:
- \( P(W_1 | H) \), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) \), the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, is 0.20.
- \( P(W_2 | H) \), the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, is 0.30.
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) \), the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, is 0.70.

We are asked to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness observed this. Using Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) (total probability of \( W_1 \) occurring) is given by:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back into Bayes' theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as per the first witness's observation, is approximately 0.414 (rounded to three decimal places).
