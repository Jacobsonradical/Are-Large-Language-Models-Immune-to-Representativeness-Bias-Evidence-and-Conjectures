To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem lets us update our prior belief based on new evidence.

**Step 1: Define the probabilities based on the data provided.**
- **P(T)** = Probability of being 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (from the city population data).
- **P(S)** = Probability of being shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (from the city population data).
- **P(W1 | T)** = Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies a tall person = 0.80.
- **P(W1 | S)** = Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall = 0.20.
- **P(W2 | T)** = Probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a tall person as short = 0.30.
- **P(W2 | S)** = Probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies a short person = 0.70.

**Step 2: Compute the probability of each witness statement.**
- We want to calculate P(W1 claims Tall and W2 claims Short), using:
  \[
  P(W1, W2) = P(W1 \cap W2|T)P(T) + P(W1 \cap W2|S)P(S)
  \]
  Here, we calculate:
  - P(W1 ∩ W2 | T) = P(W1 | T) * P(W2 | T) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24
  - P(W1 ∩ W2 | S) = P(W1 | S) * P(W2 | S) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14

  Thus:
  \[
  P(W1, W2) = 0.24 * 0.15 + 0.14 * 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the posterior probability P(T | W1, W2).**
- Using Bayes' theorem:
  \[
  P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2 | T) \times P(T)}{P(W1, W2)}
  \]
  Plugging in values:
  \[
  P(T | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 * 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.23226
  \]

Hence, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.23226. To present in the requested format:
