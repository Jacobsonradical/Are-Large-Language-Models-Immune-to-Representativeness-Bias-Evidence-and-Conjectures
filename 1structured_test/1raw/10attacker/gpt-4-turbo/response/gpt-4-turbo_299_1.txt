To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence. 

**Step 1: Establish prior probability.**
From the given data, 15% of the population (P(H)) are 185 cm or taller. Therefore:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

**Step 2: Determine likelihoods given the witnesses' accuracies.**
- The first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller 20% of the time.
  - \( P(W1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that W1 says 'taller' given attacker is taller)
  - \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Probability that W1 says 'taller' given attacker is shorter)
- The second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter 30% of the time.
  - \( P(W2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Probability that W2 says 'shorter' given attacker is taller)
  - \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Probability that W2 says 'shorter' given attacker is shorter)

**Step 3: Compute the joint probabilities based on witness testimony.**
We have two pieces of evidence: W1 says 'taller' (T) and W2 says 'shorter' (S). We combine these:
- \( P(T, S | H) = P(W1 | H) \times P(W2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(T, S | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \times P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

**Step 4: Apply Bayesâ€™ theorem to update our beliefs based on the evidence of both witnesses:**
- \( P(H | T, S) = \frac{P(T, S | H) \times P(H)}{P(T, S)} \)

Where \( P(T, S) \) is the total probability of the witnesses saying 'taller' and 'shorter', respectively:
- \( P(T, S) = P(T, S | H) \times P(H) + P(T, S | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(T, S) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Thus:
- \( P(H | T, S) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \)

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the combined evidence of both witnesses, is approximately 0.2323.

**Final answer:**
{probability: 0.2323}
