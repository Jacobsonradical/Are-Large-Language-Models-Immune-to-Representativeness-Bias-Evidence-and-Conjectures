To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' rule. This rule helps us update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) based on new evidence (likelihoods).

Let, 
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, from the city's height distribution)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, given that 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are)

We look for \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \). Applying Bayes' rule and the law of total probability:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) \) (assuming witnesses' testimonies are independent given \( H \))
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) \) (assuming witnesses' testimonies are independent given \( \neg H \))
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \)

Calculate these:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Finally:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately \( 0.2323 \).
