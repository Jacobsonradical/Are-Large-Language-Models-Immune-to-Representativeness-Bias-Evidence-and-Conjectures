To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements and their accuracies, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We are given:

- Probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller (\( P(H) \)) = 15% = 0.15.
- Probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm (\( P(\neg H) \)) = 85% = 0.85.

Let \( W_1 \) be the event where the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W_2 \) be the event where the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

We are given the accuracy of the witnesses:
- \( P(W_1 \mid H) \), the probability that W1 correctly identifies H, is 80% = 0.8.
- \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \), the probability that W1 incorrectly identifies \( \neg H \) as H, is 20% = 0.2.
- \( P(W_2 \mid H) \), the probability that W2 incorrectly identifies H as \( \neg H \), is 30% = 0.3.
- \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) \), the probability that W2 correctly identifies \( \neg H \), is 70% = 0.7.

Now, we need the joint probability of \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) given \( H \) and \( \neg H \):
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \).
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \).

Applying Bayes' Theorem (in the form \( P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \)):
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H) \).
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \).

Calculating the final probability:
- \( P(H \mid W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \).

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the information from the two witnesses, is approximately 0.2323.
