To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness statements. Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 observes the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 observes the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 is correct about taller individuals 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 is correct about shorter individuals 70% of the time)

To find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements, we use:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witness statements, is:
{probability: 0.2323}
