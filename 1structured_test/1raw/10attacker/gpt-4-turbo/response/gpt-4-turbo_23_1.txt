To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the information given, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Let H be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let W1 and W2 be the events that Witness 1 and Witness 2 respectively identify the height correctly.

Given:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(H^c) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From Witness 1, who can correctly determine the height 80% of the time:
- P(W1 | H) = 0.80 (probability that W1 correctly claims the person is taller than 185 cm)
- P(W1 | H^c) = 0.20 (probability that W1 incorrectly claims the person is taller than 185 cm)

From Witness 2, who can correctly determine the height 70% of the time:
- P(W2 | H) = 0.30 (probability that W2 incorrectly claims the person is shorter than 185 cm)
- P(W2 | H^c) = 0.70 (probability that W2 correctly claims the person is shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find P(H | W1 âˆ© W2^c), that is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 reported the person was 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 reported the person was shorter than 185 cm.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2^c) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2^c | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2^c)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2^c | H) = P(W1 | H) \times P(W2^c | H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2^c | H^c) = P(W1 | H^c) \times P(W2^c | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]
\[ P(W1 \cap W2^c) = P(W1 \cap W2^c | H) \times P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2^c | H^c) \times P(H^c) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 \]

Calculate:
\[ P(W1 \cap W2^c) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \] 
\[ P(H | W1 \cap W2^c) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.622}
