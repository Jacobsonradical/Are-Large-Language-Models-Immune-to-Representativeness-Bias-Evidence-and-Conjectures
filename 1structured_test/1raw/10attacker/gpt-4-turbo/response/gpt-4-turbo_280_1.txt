To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the given data, we use Bayes' Theorem:

Let's define:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witness accuracies and errors imply:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (witness 1 correctly claims attacker ≥ 185 cm with 80% accuracy if attacker is actually tall)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (witness 1 falsely claims attacker ≥ 185 cm 20% of the time if attacker is actually short)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (witness 2 correctly claims attacker < 185 cm with 70% accuracy if attacker is actually short)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (witness 2 falsely claims attacker < 185 cm 30% of the time if attacker is actually tall)

We want to find \( P(H | W_1) \) (probability that the attacker is tall given witness 1's claim). Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) (probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall) is given by:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So then,
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is:
{probability: 0.4138}
