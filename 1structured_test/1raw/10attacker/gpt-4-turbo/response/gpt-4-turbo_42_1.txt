To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs (in this case, the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (the witnesses' statements).

Let:
H = hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
¬H = hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
W1 = first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
W2 = second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller),
P(¬H) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
P(W1 | H) = 0.80 (first witness is correct if the attacker is taller),
P(W1 | ¬H) = 0.20 (first witness is wrong if the attacker is shorter),
P(W2 | H) = 0.30 (second witness is wrong if the attacker is taller),
P(W2 | ¬H) = 0.70 (second witness is correct if the attacker is shorter).

What we need is P(H | W1), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim.

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H)P(H)}{P(W1)} \]
where:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H)P(H) + P(W1 | ¬H)P(¬H) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So,
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is approximately 0.414.
