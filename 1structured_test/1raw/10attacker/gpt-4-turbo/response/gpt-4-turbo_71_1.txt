To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of the two witnesses and their differing reliability, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events, and is given by:

\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)} \]

where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability of event A occurring given that B is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing B given A.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of event A.
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of observing event B.

Here:
- Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_1 \) represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_2 \) represent the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From Witness 1's reliability (correct identification 80% of the time):
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) 
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability Witness 1 is incorrect)

From Witness 2's reliability (correct identification 70% of the time):
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) 
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability Witness 2 is incorrect)

First, we need to compute \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1|H)P(W_2|H)P(H) + P(W_1|\neg H)P(W_2|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.155 \]

Now, we need to compute \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.3) \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore:
{probability: 0.232}
