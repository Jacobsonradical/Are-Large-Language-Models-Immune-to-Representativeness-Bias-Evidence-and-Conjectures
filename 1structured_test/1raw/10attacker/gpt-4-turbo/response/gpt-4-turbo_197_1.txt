To solve this question, we need to incorporate both the information regarding the distribution of people's height in the city and the reliability of the witnesses. We'll use Bayes' theorem here:

Let H be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the events that the first and second witnesses respectively claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Given:

- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15% of the city's population)
- \( P(H^c) \) = 0.85 (complement of H, where \( H^c \) is the event the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

From witness 1 (says attacker is 185 cm or taller):
- \( P(W_1 | H) \) = 0.80 (accurately says taller 80% of the time when they are taller)
- \( P(W_1 | H^c) \) = 0.20 (incorrectly says taller 20% of the time when they are not)

From witness 2 (says attacker is shorter than 185 cm):
- \( P(W_2 | H) \) = 0.30 (incorrectly says shorter 30% of the time when they are taller)
- \( P(W_2 | H^c) \) = 0.70 (accurately says shorter 70% of the time when they are not)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2^c) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness said so, and the second witness disagreed. 

Using Bayes' Theorem, considering the independence of the witness statements:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2^c | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2^c)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_2^c | H) = 1 - P(W_2 | H) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2^c) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2^c | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(W_2^c | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \)
- \( P(W_2^c | H^c) = 1 - P(W_2 | H^c) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 \)

Plugging in these values:
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c) = (0.80 \times 0.70 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.30 \times 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Therefore:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.70 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the first witness's claim and considering the second witness's disagreement, is approximately:

{probability: 0.622}
