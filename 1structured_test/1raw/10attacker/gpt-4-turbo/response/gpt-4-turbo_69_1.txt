To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which in this context allows us to update the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness testimonies.
 
Let \( H \) represent the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. According to the information:
\[ P(H) = 0.15 \]
\[ P(\neg H) = 0.85 \]

where \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( P(\neg H) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

Let \( W_1 \) represent the event that witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker's height as being 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) represent the event that witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker's height as shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time:
  \[ P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \]
  \[ P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \] (because they make a mistake here)

- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time:
  \[ P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \]
  \[ P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \] (because they make a mistake here)

We want to find \( P(H | W_1) \) and \( P(\neg H | W_2) \) which update our beliefs given witness 1 saw the attacker as 185 cm or taller and witness 2 saw them as shorter. 
Since Witness 1 saw the attacker as 185 cm or taller, we keep the case \( P(H | W_1) \):

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting these values into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} = 0.4138 \]

Therefore, given the testimony of Witness 1 alone, the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller is approximately:
\[ \text{{probability}}: 0.4138 \]
(rounded to 0.414)
