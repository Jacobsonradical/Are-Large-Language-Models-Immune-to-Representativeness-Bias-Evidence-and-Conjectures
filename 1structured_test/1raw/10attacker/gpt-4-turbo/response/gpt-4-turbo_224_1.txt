Based on the given information, we can use Bayes' Theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the differing witness testimonies. Bayes' Theorem in this context is formulated as:

\[ P(H \mid A \cap B) = \frac{P(A \mid H) \times P(B \mid \neg H) \times P(H)}{P(A \cap B)} \]

where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( A \) is the event that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as being 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that the second witness correctly identified the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.
  
Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(A \mid H) = 0.8 \) (first witness's accuracy if the height is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (first witness's error rate if the height is shorter).
- \( P(B \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) (second witness's accuracy if the height is shorter).
- \( P(B \mid H) = 0.3 \) (second witness's error rate if the height is taller).

We can calculate \( P(A \cap B) \) as follows:
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A \mid H)P(B \mid H)P(H) + P(A \mid \neg H)P(B \mid \neg H)P(\neg H) = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]

Calculating these values:
\[ P(A \cap B) = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid A \cap \neg B) = \frac{P(A \mid H) \times P(\neg B \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(A \cap \neg B)} \]
\[ P(H \mid A \cap \neg B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.7 \times 0.15}{1 - 0.155} = \frac{0.084}{0.845} \approx 0.0994 \]

This gives an estimate considering that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and assuming the first witness correctly saw a taller person while the second witness mistakenly saw a shorter person. The probability \( P(H \mid A \cap \neg B) \approx 0.0994 \) suggests a roughly 10% probability aligning with the first witness being correct under this scenario. However, this depiction might have mixed some errors, as we need to consider the joint accuracy of both the first witness seeing taller and the second one mistakenly seeing shorter. Let me recompute considering the joint witness accuracy:

\[ P(H \mid A \cap B) = \frac{P(A \mid H)P(\neg B \mid \neg H)P(H)}{P(A \cap B)} \]
\[ P(H \mid A \cap B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

This suggests that the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is around 23.2%, adjusting for the witness accuracies and errors given the observed data.

Thus the final response is:
{probability: 0.232}
