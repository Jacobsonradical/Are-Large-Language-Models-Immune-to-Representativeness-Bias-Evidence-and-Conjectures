To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) represent the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) represent the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- Prior probability \(\Pr(H)\) = 15% or 0.15 (the proportion of the population that's 185 cm or taller).
- Prior probability \(\Pr(\neg H)\) = 85% or 0.85 (the proportion of the population that's shorter than 185 cm).

Accuracy of witnesses:
- Probability Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \(\Pr(W_1 | H)\) = 80% or 0.8.
- Probability Witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \(\Pr(W_1 | \neg H)\) = 20% or 0.2 (since Witness 1 would mistakenly claim the opposite).
- Probability Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \(\Pr(W_2 | \neg H)\) = 70% or 0.7.
- Probability Witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, \(\Pr(W_2 | H)\) = 30% or 0.3 (since Witness 2 would mistakenly claim the opposite).

The total probability that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 says otherwise can be calculated as follows:
\[
\Pr(W_1, W_2) = \Pr(W_1 | H) \Pr(W_2 | H) \Pr(H) + \Pr(W_1 | \neg H) \Pr(W_2 | \neg H) \Pr(\neg H)
\]
\[
= (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence from both witnesses is:
\[
\Pr(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{\Pr(W_1 | H) \Pr(W_2 | H) \Pr(H)}{\Pr(W_1, W_2)}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

So the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
\[ \{ "probability": 0.2323 \} \]
