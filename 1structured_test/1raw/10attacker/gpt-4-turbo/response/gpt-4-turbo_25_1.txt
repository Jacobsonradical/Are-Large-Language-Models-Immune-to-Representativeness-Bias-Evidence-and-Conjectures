To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on the provided information, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

1. **Define the events:**
   - Let \( H \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller."
   - Let \( W_1 \) be the event "witness 1 observes the attacker as 185 cm or taller."
   - Let \( W_2 \) be the event "witness 2 observes the attacker as shorter than 185 cm."

2. **Known probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
   - Witness 1: \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \)
   - Witness 2: \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \), \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \)

3. **Calculate the probability witness 1 is correct and witness 2 is incorrect:**
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(\neg W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \)
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \)

4. **Total probability of \( W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 \):**
   - \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
   - \( = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 \)
   - \( = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \)

5. **Use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) \):**
   - \( P(H | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2)} \)
   - \( = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \)

Given the observations and probabilities, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.622.
