To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness reports and probability distribution of heights in the population, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this case will help us update our belief about the height of the attacker in light of new evidence (the witness testimony).

Let:
- \(H\) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(E\) represent the evidence provided by the witnesses.

We know:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\), since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\), since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.
- Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and they are correct 80% of the time and wrong 20% of the time.
- Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and they are correct 70% of the time and wrong 30% of the time.

To find \(P(H|E)\), we calculate:
- \(P(E|H)\) = Probability that W1 says "185 cm or taller" and is correct, AND W2 says "shorter" and is wrong:
\[ P(E|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

- \(P(E|\neg H)\) = Probability that W1 says "185 cm or taller" and is wrong, AND W2 says "shorter" and is correct:
\[ P(E|\neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E|H) \times P(H) + P(E|\neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
Substitute the values:
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ P(H|E) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E) \approx 0.23226 \]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the witness statements is approximately:
{
  "probability": 0.23226
