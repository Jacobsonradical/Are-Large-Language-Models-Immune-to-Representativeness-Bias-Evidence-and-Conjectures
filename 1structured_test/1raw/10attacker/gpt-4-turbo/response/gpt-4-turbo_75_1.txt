To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimony, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness testifies the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness testifies the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- The accuracy of the first witness is 80% when identifying someone 185 cm or taller, and 20% error otherwise.
- The accuracy of the second witness is 70% when identifying someone shorter than 185 cm, and 30% error otherwise.

Using these, we calculate:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as 185 cm or taller).

- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm).

We need to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. 

Using the conditional probability formula:
\[ P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A) \]
We know:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Apply Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
