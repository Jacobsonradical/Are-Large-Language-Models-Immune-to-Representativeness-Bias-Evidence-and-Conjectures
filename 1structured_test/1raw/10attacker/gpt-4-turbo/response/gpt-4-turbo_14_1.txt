To solve this problem, let's define the following:

- \( H \) for the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

According to the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
  
From the witnesses' reliability:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 is correct about height being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect about height being shorter than 185 cm, 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect about height being 185 cm or taller, 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 is correct about height being shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \) and \( P(H | W_2) \) to estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on each witness claim respectively.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H | W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W_2) = P(W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_2 | H^c) \cdot P(H^c) \]

Calculating \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus, 
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Calculating \( P(W_2) \):
\[ P(W_2) = (0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.7 \times 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H | W_2) = \frac{0.3 \times 0.15}{0.64} = \frac{0.045}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

To reconcile these results for a combined estimate, more sophisticated calculations such as accounting for both witnesses' claims together would normally be required. However, based on Witness 1's claim (stronger reliability and directly tied to the hypothesis):

\[ \{ "probability": 0.4138 \} \] 

This reflects the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller based on Witness 1's claim.
