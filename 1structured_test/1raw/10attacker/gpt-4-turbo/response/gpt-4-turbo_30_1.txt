To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem to estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies. We start by defining our variables:

- Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) represent the testimonies of witness 1 and witness 2, respectively, with witness 1 claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller (identifying correctly with \( P(\text{correct}|H) = 0.8 \) and incorrectly with \( P(\text{incorrect}|H^c) = 0.2 \)), and witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (identifying correctly with \( P(\text{correct}|H^c) = 0.7 \) and incorrectly with \( P(\text{incorrect}|H) = 0.3 \)).

Given this, we can write the likelihoods:
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.8 \) (Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies H)
- \( P(W_1|H^c) = 0.2 \) (Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies \( H^c \) as H)
- \( P(W_2|H^c) = 0.7 \) (Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies \( H^c \))
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.3 \) (Probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies H as \( H^c \))

Given in the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that a randomly chosen person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(W_2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2|H^c) = P(W_1|H^c) \times P(W_2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of the witnesses' testimonies:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2|H^c) \times P(H^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, computing the posterior probability:
\[ P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is:
{probability: 0.2323}
