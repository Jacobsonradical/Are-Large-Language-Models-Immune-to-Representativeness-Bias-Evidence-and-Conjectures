To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' reports and their respective accuracies, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller. Our goal is to find \( P(H|W_1, W_2) \), where \( W_1 \) is the event "first witness reports the attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( W_2 \) is the event "second witness reports the attacker is shorter than 185 cm".

1. **Initial probabilities**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Witness accuracies**:
   - **First witness** (\( W_1 \)):
     - Correct if \( H \) true: \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
     - Incorrect if \( \neg H \) true: \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \)
   - **Second witness** (\( W_2 \)):
     - Incorrect if \( H \) true: \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \)
     - Correct if \( \neg H \) true: \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \)

3. **Joint probabilities**:
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Overall probability of the witness reports**:
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \)
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \)
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

5. **Updated probability \( P(H|W_1, W_2) \)** using Bayes' theorem:
   - \( P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \)
   - \( P(H|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.232.
