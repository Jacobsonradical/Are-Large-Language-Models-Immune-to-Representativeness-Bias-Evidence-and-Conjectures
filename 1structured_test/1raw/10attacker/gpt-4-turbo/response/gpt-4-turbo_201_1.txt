To solve this question, we can use Bayes' theorem for updating the probability based on the evidence provided by the two witnesses. Let's denote the following:

- \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) is the event that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) is the event that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We are given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The accuracy of the witnesses:
- First witness accuracy: \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (erroneous identification if the attacker was actually shorter).
- Second witness accuracy: \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \).

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimony from the two witnesses.

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \):
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Apply the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, calculate \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
- \( P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \)
- \( P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \) 

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.2323.
