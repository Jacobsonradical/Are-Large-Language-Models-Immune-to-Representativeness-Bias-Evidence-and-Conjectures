To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the total probability law with information given by the witnesses. We can denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller as \( H \), and its complementary event (the attacker was shorter than 185 cm) as \( \neg H \). We are interested in calculating \( P(H | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) \), where \( W_1 \) is the first witness's claim that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( \neg W_2 \) is the second witness's claim that the attacker was shorter.

The prior probabilities (from information set b) are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The likelihood of the witness observations given the height (from information set a):
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (first witness)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) and \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (second witness)
- \( P(\neg W_2 | H) = 1 - P(W_2 | H) = 0.7 \)
- \( P(\neg W_2 | \neg H) = 1 - P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.3 \)

We can use Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

To find \( P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) \) (total probability):
\[ P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \text{ and } \neg W_2) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.6222 \]

Thus, our estimate would be:
{probability: 0.6222}
