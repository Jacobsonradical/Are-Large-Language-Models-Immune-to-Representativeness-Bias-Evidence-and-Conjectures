To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness testimony and demographic information, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem helps us update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the provided data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

Also, we know:
- Witness 1 identifies correctly 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, so \( P(A_1 | H) = 0.80 \). Thus, Witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time, therefore \( P(A_1 | \overline{H}) = 0.20 \).
- Witness 2 identifies correctly shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, so \( P(A_2 | \overline{H}) = 0.70 \). Thus, \( P(A_2 | H) = 0.30 \) as Witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time.

We want to calculate:
\[ P(H | A_1 \cap \overline{A_2}) \]

Using Bayes' theorem, extended to handle intersection of independent witness events:
\[ P(H | A_1 \cap \overline{A_2}) = \frac{P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2})} \]

Calculating:
\- \( P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} | H) = P(A_1 | H) \cdot P(\overline{A_2} | H) = 0.80 \cdot (1 - 0.30) = 0.80 \cdot 0.70 = 0.56 \)
\- \( P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} | \overline{H}) = P(A_1 | \overline{H}) \cdot P(\overline{A_2} | \overline{H}) = 0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.70) = 0.20 \cdot 0.30 = 0.06 \)
\- \( P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2}) = P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} | H) \cdot P(H) + P(A_1 \cap \overline{A_2} | \overline{H}) \cdot P(\overline{H}) = 0.56 \cdot 0.15 + 0.06 \cdot 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \)

Finally:

\[ P(H | A_1 \cap \overline{A_2}) \approx \frac{0.084}{0.135} = 0.622 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately 0.622.
