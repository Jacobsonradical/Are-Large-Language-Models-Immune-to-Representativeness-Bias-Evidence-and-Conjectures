To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context allows us to update our initial beliefs about the height of the attacker based on the information provided by the witnesses. 

Let:
- \(H\) = event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(H^c\) = event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\) = event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) = event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \(P(H^c) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The first witness has an accuracy of 80%, so:
- \(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8\) (probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are).
- \(P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2\) (probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not).

According to Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the first witness's claim (\(W_1\)) is:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) P(H^c) \]
\[ P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

The answer in the required format is thus:

{ "probability": 0.4138 }
