To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem, which is calculated as follows:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]
where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability of the hypothesis before seeing the evidence, which in this case is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the hypothesis. Here it would include the probabilities that the witnesses correctly or incorrectly identified the height based on the attacker being taller or shorter.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence under all possible outcomes.

The evidence consists of conflicting statements from two witnesses. Let's break down the calculation:

1. **Calculate \( P(E \mid H) \) and \( P(E \mid \neg H) \)**:
   - \( P(\text{Witness 1 is correct} \mid H) = 0.80 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness 1 is incorrect} \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness 2 is correct} \mid \neg H) = 0.70 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness 2 is incorrect} \mid H) = 0.30 \)

2. **Combine these for claims under each hypothesis**:
   - \( P(\text{Witness 1 says Tall and Witness 2 says Short} \mid H) = P(\text{Witness 1 correct, Witness 2 incorrect} \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(\text{Witness 1 says Tall and Witness 2 says Short} \mid \neg H) = P(\text{Witness 1 incorrect, Witness 2 correct} \mid \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

3. **Calculate \( P(E) \)**:
   - \( P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
     - \( = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \)
     - \( = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

4. **Use Bayes' theorem to compute \( P(H \mid E) \)**:
   - \( P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \)
   - \( = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \)
   - \( = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Thus, the updated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, considering the evidence provided by the witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
