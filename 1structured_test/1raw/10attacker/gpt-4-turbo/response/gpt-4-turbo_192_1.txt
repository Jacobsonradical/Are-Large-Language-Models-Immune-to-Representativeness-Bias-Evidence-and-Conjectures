To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this case will help us update our belief about the attacker's height based on the witnesses' statements. 

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) be the events that Witness 1 and Witness 2, respectively, stated their observed heights (Witness 1 stating the attacker is 185 cm or taller, Witness 2 stating the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

From the problem, we know the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to compute \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements. By Bayes' Theorem and the total probability law:

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) \) since witness statements are assumed to be independent given the height.
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) P(W_2 | H^c) \)

\[ 
P(W_1, W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 
\]
\[ 
P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 
\]

Using total probability law for \( P(W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) P(H^c)
\]
\[
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
\]
\[
= 0.036 + 0.119
\]
\[
= 0.155
\]

Now, we substitute back to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} â‰ˆ 0.23226
\]

Rounding this probability, we have:

{probability: 0.23226}
