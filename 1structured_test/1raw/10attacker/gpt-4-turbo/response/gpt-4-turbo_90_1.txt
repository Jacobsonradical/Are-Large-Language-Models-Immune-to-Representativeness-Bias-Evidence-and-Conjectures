To solve this problem, we will use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs about the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witness accounts. Here we denote \( H \) as the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( H^c \) as "attacker is shorter than 185 cm". The statements of the first and second witnesses will be denoted as \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) respectively.

From the information:
1. Probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
2. Probability \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The first witness has an accuracy of 80% whether the person is \( H \) or \( H^c \). 
- Probability \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is taller than 185 cm).
- Probability \( P(W_1 | H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect, given attacker is shorter than 185 cm, mistakenly saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller).

The second witness has an accuracy of 70%.
- Probability \( P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- Probability \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller, mistakenly saying theyâ€™re shorter).

Now, using the total probability theorem, we can calculate \( P(W_1) \) and \( P(W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) P(H^c) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(W_2) = P(W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_2 | H^c) P(H^c) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Now, we compute the ultimate probability of \( H \) given both \( W_1 \) (1st witness claim) and \( W_2 \) (opposition by 2nd witness). Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) P(H^c) \]

Calculating:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) \times P(W_2 | H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Thus,
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally,
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the combined estimate probability the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses, is about 0.2323.
