To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the statements made by two witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. The theorem helps update our belief about a certain condition based on new information.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness incorrectly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The conditional probabilities given the witnessesâ€™ accuracies are:
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as taller)

- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone 185 cm or taller as shorter)
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm)

We need to calculate \( P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies. Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability,

\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) = P(W_1 | A^c) P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now, calculating \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) P(A^c) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Hence,
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

This gives us the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness accounts. Thus:

{probability: 0.2323}
