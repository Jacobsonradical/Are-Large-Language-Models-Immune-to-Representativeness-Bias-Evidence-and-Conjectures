To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the contradictory testimonies and the witnesses' accuracies, we can apply Bayes' theorem:

Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.

- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\overline{H}) \) is the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, given as 85% or 0.85.

The witness abilities are given as:
- For witness 1 (claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller):
  - \( P(\text{witness 1 is correct} \mid H) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(\text{witness 1 is incorrect} \mid \overline{H}) = 0.2 \)
- For witness 2 (claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm):
  - \( P(\text{witness 2 is correct} \mid \overline{H}) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(\text{witness 2 is incorrect} \mid H) = 0.3 \)

The total probability that both witnesses would give their specific testimonies can be calculated as follows:
- Probability both witness 1 and 2 testify as they did given \( H \):
  \( P(\text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2} \mid H) = P(\text{witness 1 correct} \mid H) \times P(\text{witness 2 incorrect} \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)

- Probability both witness 1 and 2 testify as they did given \( \overline{H} \):
  \( P(\text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2} \mid \overline{H}) = P(\text{witness 1 incorrect} \mid \overline{H}) \times P(\text{witness 2 correct} \mid \overline{H}) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

The total probability of the testimonies (law of total probability) is:
\[ P(\text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2}) = (P(H) \times 0.24) + (P(\overline{H}) \times 0.14) = (0.15 \times 0.24) + (0.85 \times 0.14) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, applying Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies:
\[ P(H \mid \text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2}) = \frac{P(\text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2} \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(\text{testimony 1} \cap \text{testimony 2})} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
