To answer this question, we can make use of Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update a previous probability based on new evidence. In this case, our unknown probability is whether the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let:
- \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E1 \) represent the event that witness 1 testified the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E2 \) represent the event that witness 2 testified the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the problem, the first witness is correct 80% of the time:
- \( P(E1|H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 is right given the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(E1|H^c) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 is right about the attacker being taller, but actually, the attacker is shorter).

From the problem, the second witness is correct 70% of the time:
- \( P(E2|H^c) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is right given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(E2|H) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 is wrong about the attacker being shorter when actually the attacker is taller).

We need to find \( P(H|E1) \), but we have evidence from both witnesses. We seek the joint probability of both witness reports given \( H \) and \( H^c \):

- \( P(E1 \cap E2|H) = P(E1|H) \times P(E2|H) \)
- \( P(E1 \cap E2|H^c) = P(E1|H^c) \times P(E2|H^c) \)

Calculating these:
- \( P(E1 \cap E2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E1 \cap E2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Using the total law of probability for \( P(E1 \cap E2) \):
- \( P(E1 \cap E2) = P(E1 \cap E2|H)P(H) + P(E1 \cap E2|H^c)P(H^c) \),
- \( P(E1 \cap E2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \).

Then using Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(H|E1 \cap E2) = \frac{P(E1 \cap E2|H)P(H)}{P(E1 \cap E2)} \),
- \( P(H|E1 \cap E2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \).

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both the witnesses is approximately 0.23226.
