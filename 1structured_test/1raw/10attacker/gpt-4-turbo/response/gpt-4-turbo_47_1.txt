To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the provided testimony and error rates of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
- \( P(H) \) (the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) = 0.15
- \( P(\neg H) \) (the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85

Also, we know the witnesses' reliability:
- \( P(W_1 | H) \) (the probability that the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are) = 0.8
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) \) (the probability that the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are not) = 0.2

- \( P(W_2 | H) \) (the probability that the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are 185 cm or taller) = 0.3
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) \) (the probability that the second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, given that they are not) = 0.7

The probability that Witness 1 testified that the attacker is 185 cm or taller and Witness 2 testified that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, conditioned on different attacker heights, can be considered independent given their respective claims, leading to:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
\]
Where,
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
\]
Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Now, calculate \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226
\]

Thus, the estimated probability is approximately 0.23226 that the attacker is 185 cm or taller based on witnesses' testimonies.

Therefore, the answer is:

{ "probability": 0.23226 }
