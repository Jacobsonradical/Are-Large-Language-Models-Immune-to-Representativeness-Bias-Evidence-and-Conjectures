To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem, which is a way to consider how a given evidence affects the probability of an event.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{H} \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 observes the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 observes the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

According to the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

From witness statement accuracies:
- \( P(W_1 | H) \) (Probability witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are indeed that tall) = 0.80.
- \( P(W_1 | \overline{H}) \) (Probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller, given that they are actually shorter) = 0.20.
- \( P(W_2 | H) \) (Probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, even though they are 185 cm or taller) = 0.30.
- \( P(W_2 | \overline{H}) \) (Probability witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm, if they are indeed shorter) = 0.70.

Using the law of total probability, the probability of witness observations:
- \( P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H}) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
- \( P(W_2) = P(W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_2 | \overline{H}) \times P(\overline{H}) = 0.30 \times 0.15 + 0.70 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \)

We need to find \( P(H | W_1) \) â€” the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given Witness 1's observation:
- \( P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4137 \)

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is about 0.41 when considering the accuracy of Witness 1.
