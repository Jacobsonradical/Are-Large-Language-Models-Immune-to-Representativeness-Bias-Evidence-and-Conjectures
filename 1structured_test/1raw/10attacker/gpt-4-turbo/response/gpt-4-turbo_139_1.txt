To solve this problem, we use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs based on the evidence provided by the witnesses.

1. **Prior Probability \( P(H) \)**: Probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
   - Given as \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population).

2. **Complement of the Prior \( P(\neg H) \)**: Probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
   - Computed as \( P(\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population).

3. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Witness 1's Accuracy (W1)**:
     - Probability of Witness 1 correctly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \).
     - Probability of Witness 1 incorrectly identifying someone as shorter, when they are not, \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.20 \).
   - **Witness 2's Accuracy (W2)**:
     - Probability of Witness 2 incorrectly identifying someone as 185 cm or taller, when they are not, \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \).
     - Probability of Witness 2 correctly identifying someone as shorter, \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \).

4. **Total Probability of Witness Reports** \( P(W1, W2) \):
   - Calculated using Total Law of Probability.
   - \( P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1|H) \times P(W2|H) \times P(H) + P(W1|\neg H) \times P(W2|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \).
   - Breaking it down:
     - \( P(W1 \cap W2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \) (Probability both witness 1 and witness 2's reports are consistent, assuming attacker is 185 cm or taller).
     - \( P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \) (Probability both witness 1 and witness 2's reports are consistent, assuming attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
   - \( P(W1 \cap W2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \).

5. **Posterior Probability \( P(H|W1, W2) \)**:
   - Using Bayes' Theorem:
   - \( P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \).
   - \( P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \).

Therefore, based on the evidence provided by both witnesses and the prior probability distribution of heights, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately **0.2323**.
