To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian probability to update our beliefs based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg A \) as the event that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 testifies the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 testifies the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (witness 1 correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \) (witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter people as taller 20% of the time).
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.3 \) (witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller people as shorter 30% of the time).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \) (witness 2 correctly identifies shorter people 70% of the time).

Using these probabilities, the total probability that witness 1 claims the attacker was taller, \( P(W_1) \), can be calculated by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A)P(A) + P(W_1 | \neg A)P(\neg A) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29. \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 testifies so:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A)P(A)}{P(W_1)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138. \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
