To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence.

Let \(H\) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \(\neg H\) be the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. We want to find the probability \(\Pr(H \mid E_1, E_2)\), where \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the observations from Witness 1 (attacker is 185 cm or taller) and Witness 2 (attacker is shorter than 185 cm), respectively.

From the problem, we know:
- \(\Pr(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(\Pr(\neg H) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The problem states accuracy rates for each witness:
- Witness 1 has an accuracy of 80% (\(\Pr(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8\) and \(\Pr(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2\))
- Witness 2 has an accuracy of 70% (\(\Pr(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3\) and \(\Pr(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7\))

We apply Bayes' theorem:
\[
\Pr(H \mid E_1, E_2) = \frac{\Pr(E_1, E_2 \mid H) \Pr(H)}{\Pr(E_1, E_2)}
\]

Using the conditional independence assumption (the witnesses provide independent evidences given H), we find:
\[
\Pr(E_1, E_2 \mid H) = \Pr(E_1 \mid H) \Pr(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
\Pr(E_1, E_2 \mid \neg H) = \Pr(E_1 \mid \neg H) \Pr(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Using the law of total probability for \(\Pr(E_1, E_2)\):
\[
\Pr(E_1, E_2) = \Pr(E_1, E_2 \mid H) \Pr(H) + \Pr(E_1, E_2 \mid \neg H) \Pr(\neg H) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally:
\[
\Pr(H \mid E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking the testimony of both witnesses into account, is approximately 0.23226.
