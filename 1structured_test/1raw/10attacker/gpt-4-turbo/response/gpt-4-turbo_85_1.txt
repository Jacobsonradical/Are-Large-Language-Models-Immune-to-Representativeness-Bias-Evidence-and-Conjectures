To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' theorem which helps us update our probability estimates with new evidence. Let's frame it step by step:

Let \(H\) be the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
Let \(E_1\) be the evidence provided by the first witness claiming the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Let \(E_2\) be the evidence provided by the second witness claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the given data:
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) (the probability of being 185 cm or taller without any additional information) is 15%, or 0.15.
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\(P(\neg H)\)) is 85%, or 0.85.
- The first witness is correct about the height being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time. Thus, \(P(E_1 | H) = 0.80\).
- The first witness is wrong about the height 20% of the time, thus \(P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.20\).
- The second witness is correct about the height being shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time. Thus, \(P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.70\).
- The second witness is wrong about the height 30% of the time, thus \(P(E_2 | H) = 0.30\).

First, we'll calculate the probability of each witness seeing what they did:
- \(P(E_1)\) can be computed as \(P(E_1 | H)P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.80 \times 0.15 + 0.20 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29\).
- \(P(E_2)\) is similarly \(P(E_2 | H)P(H) + P(E_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.30 \times 0.15 + 0.70 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64\).

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1)} = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]
\[ P(H | E_2) = \frac{P(E_2 | H) P(H)}{P(E_2)} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

These probabilities reflect how likely \(H\) is given the individual evidence from each witness. However, what we need is to consider both pieces of evidence together. To find this combined probability, \(P(H | E_1, E_2)\), we apply Bayes' theorem again considering the new evidence from the second witness along with the first:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_2 | H) P(H | E_1)}{P(E_2)} = \frac{0.30 \times 0.4138}{0.64} \approx 0.1937. \]

Thus, considering both pieces of conflicting witness testimonies using Bayesian updating, we estimate that the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.1937.
