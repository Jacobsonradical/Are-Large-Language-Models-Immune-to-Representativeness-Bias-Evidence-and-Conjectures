To solve the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses and the distribution of heights in the population, we can use Bayes' theorem:

Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) be the events that the first and second witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively.

From the data given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter as taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies taller as shorter 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter 70% of the time)

We want to find \( P(A | W_1, W_2^c) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so and the second witness claimed otherwise. 

We'll find \( P(W_1, W_2^c) \) first:
\[
P(W_1, W_2^c) = P(W_1, W_2^c | A)P(A) + P(W_1, W_2^c | A^c)P(A^c)
\]
\[
= (P(W_1|A) \cdot P(W_2^c|A) \cdot P(A)) + (P(W_1|A^c) \cdot P(W_2^c|A^c) \cdot P(A^c))
\]
\[
= (0.80 \cdot 0.70 \cdot 0.15) + (0.20 \cdot 0.30 \cdot 0.85)
\]
\[
= 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135
\]

Next, \( P(A | W_1, W_2^c) \):
\[
P(A | W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2^c | A)P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2^c)}
\]
\[
= \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.70 \cdot 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622
\]

Thus, the computed probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so and the second witness claimed otherwise, is approximately:
