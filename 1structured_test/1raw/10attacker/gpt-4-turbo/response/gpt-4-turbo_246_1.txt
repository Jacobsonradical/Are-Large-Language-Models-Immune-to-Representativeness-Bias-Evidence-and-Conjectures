To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. 

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (from the population data).
- The conditional probabilities based on witness reliability:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (correct and error rates for the first witness).
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) and \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (error and correct rates for the second witness).

We seek \( P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \). Using the law of total probability, we can calculate:

\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Plugging in the population probabilities:
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now using Bayes' Theorem for \( P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2)} \]
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.232.
