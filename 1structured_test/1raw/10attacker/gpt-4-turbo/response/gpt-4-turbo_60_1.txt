To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information available, we'll use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]

Where:
- \( T \) represents the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W \) represents the event that a witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(T) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15.
- \( P(W \mid T) \) is the probability of a witness correctly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller. Since Witness 1 correctly identifies taller people 80% of the time, \( P(W \mid T) = 0.80 \).
- \( P(W \mid T^c) \) is the probability of a witness incorrectly identifying an attacker as 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. For Witness 1, the error rate is 20%, so \( P(W \mid T^c) = 0.20 \).
- \( P(T^c) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 0.85.

First, we calculate \( P(W) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W) = P(W \mid T) P(T) + P(W \mid T^c) P(T^c) \]
\[ P(W) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(T \mid W) \):

\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{P(W \mid T) P(T)}{P(W)} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(T \mid W) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
