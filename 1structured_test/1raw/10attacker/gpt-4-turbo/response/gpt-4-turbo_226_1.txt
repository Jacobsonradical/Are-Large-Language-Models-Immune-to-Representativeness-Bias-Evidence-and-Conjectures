To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we'll use Bayes' theorem. Let H represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and E represent the evidence provided by the witnesses.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

From the given data:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%)
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85%)

The probability that the witnesses correctly or incorrectly identified the attacker's height:
- Witness 1 accuracy when attacker is \( \geq 185 \) cm = 80% (correct) and 20% (incorrect).
- Witness 1 accuracy when attacker is < 185 cm = 20% (incorrect) and 80% (correct).
- Witness 2 accuracy when attacker is \( \geq 185 \) cm = 70% (correct) and 30% (incorrect).
- Witness 2 accuracy when attacker is < 185 cm = 30% (incorrect) and 70% (correct).

Now, \( P(E | H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the attacker is 185 cm or taller. This includes Witness 1 being correct and Witness 2 being incorrect:
\[ P(E | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

\( P(E | \neg H) \) is the probability of observing the evidence given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm. This includes Witness 1 being incorrect and Witness 2 being correct:
\[ P(E | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

\( P(E) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(E) = P(E | H) \times P(H) + P(E | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H | E) \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

So the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, according to the witness testimonies and their accuracies is approximately 0.232.

However, we should also consider the implications of the combined reporting of two witnesses. Witness 2 testified contrary to Witness 1, so we need to adjust given that they contradicted each other. This requires a slightly more complex analysis (considering both witnesses' testimonies), so the number given above assumes only direct consideration of witness 1 vs. witness 2 in their individual probabilities without interactive adjustment.

The adjusted calculation (more complex, considering dual testimony impact directly) isn't shown here but might slightly alter the 0.232 estimate. For a basic approach such as this, the final result:
- {probability: 0.232}
