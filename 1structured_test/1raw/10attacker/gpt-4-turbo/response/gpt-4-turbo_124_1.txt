To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the probability of the evidence.
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given the evidence.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\lnot H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The first witness accuracy is 80% if the attacker was 185 cm or taller and 20% inaccurate. Thus:
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies someone 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\lnot E_1 \mid \lnot H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm as being taller).

The second witness accuracy is 70% if the attacker was shorter than 185 cm and 30% inaccurate. Thus:
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a taller individual as being shorter).
- \( P(\lnot E_2 \mid \lnot H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies someone shorter than 185 cm).

Now, we combine the evidence using:
- \( P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) \)
- \( P(E \mid \lnot H) = P(\lnot E_1 \mid \lnot H) \times P(\lnot E_2 \mid \lnot H) \)
- \( P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \lnot H) \times P(\lnot H) \)

Calculations:
- \( P(E \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E \mid \lnot H) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \)
- \( P(E) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.56 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.476 = 0.512 \)

Finally, using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.512} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.512} \approx 0.0703125 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given this evidence, is approximately 0.0703.
