To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes' theorem which is used when we need to update the probability of an event (in this case, the attacker being 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (testimonies of the witnesses). 

Let's define the following:

- **H** = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- **¬H** = Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- **E1** = Witness 1's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- **E2** = Witness 2's statement that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the provided data:
- P(**H**) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(**¬H**) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The court's evaluation revealed the witness accuracy:
- For the first witness:
  - P(**E1** | **H**) = 0.8 (accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - P(**E1** | ¬**H**) = 0.2 (error rate when the attacker is shorter)
- For the second witness:
  - P(**E2** | **H**) = 0.3 (error rate when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - P(**E2** | ¬**H**) = 0.7 (accuracy when the attacker is shorter)

Using Bayes' theorem to update the probability, we need the probability of Witness 1's claim given the height:
\[ \text{P(H | E1)} = \frac{P(E1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E1)} \]

Where,
\[ P(E1) = P(E1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(E1 | ¬H) \cdot P(¬H) \]
\[ P(E1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, updated probability:
\[ \text{P(H | E1)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witness 1's statement, is approximately 0.4138.

**Answer: {probability: 0.4138}**
