To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness states that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness states that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The probability of each witness being correct or incorrect:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies tall persons 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies short persons as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies tall persons as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies short persons 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

We can find \( P(W_1, W_2) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232.

Thus, the answer is: {probability: 0.232}
