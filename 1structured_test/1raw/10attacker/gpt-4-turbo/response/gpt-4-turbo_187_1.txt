To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the information provided (denoted as H), we can use Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H \mid E) \) is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the evidence from the witnesses.
- \( P(E \mid H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 based on the population statistics.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Given two pieces of evidence \( E_1 \) (first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller) and \( E_2 \) (second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm):
- We assume the witnesses' testimonies are independent.
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) \) (probability first witness is correct given the attacker is tall): 0.8
- \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \) (probability first witness is incorrect given the attacker is not tall): 0.2
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) \) (probability second witness is incorrect given the attacker is tall): 0.3
- \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \) (probability second witness is correct given the attacker is not tall): 0.7

Applying these:
\[ P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of the evidence \( P(E) \) is:
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.2323.
