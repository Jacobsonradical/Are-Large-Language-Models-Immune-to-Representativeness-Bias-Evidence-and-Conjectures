To solve this problem, we need to apply Bayes' theorem, which updates the probability estimate based on new evidence. Let's use the following notations:

- \( H \) for the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) for the alternative, that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) that the first witness correctly claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) that the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the given problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

According to the witnesses' reliability:
- First witness has an 80% chance to correctly identify if a person is 185 cm or taller, and hence also has an 80% chance to mistakenly say someone shorter than 185 cm is taller.
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \)

- The second witness has a 70% chance of correctly identifying if a person is shorter than 185 cm, but a 30% chance of mistakenly saying someone 185 cm or taller is shorter.
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
Where, 
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(W_2 | H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg H) \]

Plug in the values:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Total probability of \( W_1 \cap W_2 \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.2323 \]

Hence, evaluating the probability of attacker being 185 cm or taller factoring in the reliability of the witnesses:
{probability: 0.2323}
