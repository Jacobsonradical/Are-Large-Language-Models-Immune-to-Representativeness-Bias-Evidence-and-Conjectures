To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote:
- \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) as the complement of \( A \) (i.e., the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( W_1 \) as the event where witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event where witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the provided information:
- Prior probabilities based on the general population: \( P(A) = 0.15 \) and \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \).
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as \( 185 \) cm or taller 80% of the time and mistakenly identifies shorter individuals as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time. Thus, \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \), and \( P(W_1 | A^c) = 0.20 \).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and mistakenly identifies taller individuals as shorter 30% of the time. Thus, \( P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.70 \), and \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \).

We need to find \( P(A | W_1) \) — the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claimed so.

According to Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1)}
\]
where:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 | A^c) \times P(A^c)
       = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85)
       = 0.12 + 0.17
       = 0.29
\]

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.414.
