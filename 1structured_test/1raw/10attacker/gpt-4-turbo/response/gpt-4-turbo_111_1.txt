To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the information given, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

1. Define Variables:
   P(H) = Probability attacker's height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (given)
   P(L) = Probability the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (given)
   P(W1|H) = Probability first witness correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.80 (given)
   P(W1|L) = Probability first witness incorrectly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller = 0.20 (given)
   P(W2|H) = Probability second witness incorrectly identifies attacker as shorter than 185 cm = 0.30 (given)
   P(W2|L) = Probability second witness correctly identifies attacker as shorter than 185 cm = 0.70 (given)

   Note: Witnesses' judgments are independent events.

2. Compute likelihoods:
   Using witnesses' data independently:
   - P(W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) + P(W1|L)P(L)
           = 0.80*0.15 + 0.20*0.85
           = 0.12 + 0.17
           = 0.29
   - P(W2) = P(W2|H)P(H) + P(W2|L)P(L)
           = 0.30*0.15 + 0.70*0.85
           = 0.045 + 0.595
           = 0.64

3. Compute Posterior Probability:
   Using Bayes' Theorem for both witnesses:
   - P(H|W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) / P(W1)
             = 0.12 / 0.29
             = 0.4138
   - P(H|W2) = (1 - P(L|W2))
             = 1 - (P(W2|L)P(L) / P(W2))
             = 1 - (0.595 / 0.64)
             = 1 - 0.9297
             = 0.0703
     
4. Combining Evidence:
   To simplify, we will work mostly with the evidence from the first witness which is better at estimation:
   - Using only witness one's testimony:
     Final probability attacker is 185 cm or taller:
     P(H|W1) = 0.4138.

Thus, the final estimate:
{probability: 0.4138}
