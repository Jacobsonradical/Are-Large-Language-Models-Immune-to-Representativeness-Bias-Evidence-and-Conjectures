To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of two witnesses and information about the general population height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the events:

- \( A \): The event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \): The event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(A^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|A) = 0.80 \) (Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1|A^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

- \( P(W_2|A) = 0.30 \) (Probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2|A^c) = 0.70 \) (Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)

We want to find the probability \( P(A|W_1) \) that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claims so. 

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1|A^c) \cdot P(A^c) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging the values into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(A|W_1) â‰ˆ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
