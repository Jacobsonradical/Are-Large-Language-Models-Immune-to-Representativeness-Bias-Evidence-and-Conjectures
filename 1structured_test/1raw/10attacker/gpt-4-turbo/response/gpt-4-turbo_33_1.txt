To solve this, we need to use Bayes' Theorem, which is a way to find a probability when we know certain other probabilities. Let's define our events:

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

The abilities of the witnesses are given as:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time, so:
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability Witness 1 claims attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability Witness 1 claims attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time, so:
  - \( P(W_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) 
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find the probability \( P(H \mid W_1) \) (probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims they are 185 cm or taller):

\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

where

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) P(H) + P(W_1 \mid \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.4138.

Therefore, the final estimate would be: 

{probability: 0.4138}
