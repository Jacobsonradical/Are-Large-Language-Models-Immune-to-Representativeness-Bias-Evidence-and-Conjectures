To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem, which revises the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

The prior probabilities \( P(H) \) and \( P(\neg H) \) are:
- \( P(H) \) = Probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller = 15% = 0.15
- \( P(\neg H) \) = Probability that a person in the population is shorter than 185 cm = 85% = 0.85

The likelihoods \( P(E_1 \mid H) \) and \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \) for the first witness are:
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) \) = Probability that the first witness says the person is 185 cm or taller given the person is really 185 cm or taller = 80% = 0.8
- \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \) = Probability that the first witness says the person is 185 cm or taller given the person is really shorter than 185 cm = 20% = 0.2

The likelihoods \( P(E_2 \mid H) \) and \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \) for the second witness are:
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) \) = Probability that the second witness says the person is shorter than 185 cm given the person is really 185 cm or taller = 30% = 0.3
- \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) \) = Probability that the second witness says the person is shorter than 185 cm given the person is really shorter than 185 cm = 70% = 0.7

Using Bayes' theorem, we revise the likelihood of \( H \) given each witness's testimony \( E \). The combined probability \( P(H \mid E) \), considering that each witness makes their claims independently, is given by:

\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)}
\]
where
\[
P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
\]

\( E \) here includes both witness statements. Multiple these probabilities by assuming independence:
- \( P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \times P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Plugging these into the total probability formula:
\[
P(E) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Thus, the posterior probability \( P(H \mid E) \) is:
\[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
