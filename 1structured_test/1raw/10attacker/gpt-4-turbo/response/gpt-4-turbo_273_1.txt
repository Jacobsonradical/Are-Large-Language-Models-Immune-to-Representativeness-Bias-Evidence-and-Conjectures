To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting testimonies of two witnesses and their respective accuracies, we can use Bayes' theorem. 

Let:
- \(H\) = attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \(L\) = attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \(W_1\) = first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \(W_2\) = second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the data:
- The prior probability \(P(H)\) = 15% = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- The prior probability \(P(L)\) = 85% = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The conditional probabilities given by the witnesses' accuracies are:
- \(P(W_1 | H)\) = 80% = 0.8 (probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is >= 185 cm)
- \(P(W_1 | L)\) = 20% = 0.2 (probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is < 185 cm)
- \(P(W_2 | H)\) = 30% = 0.3 (probability witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is >= 185 cm)
- \(P(W_2 | L)\) = 70% = 0.7 (probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is < 185 cm)

We are interested in \(P(H | W_1)\) and \(P(H | W_2)\). However, the question specifically asks for \(P(H | W_1)\) based on the first witness's claim. We apply Bayes' Theorem for \(P(H | W_1)\):

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

To find \(P(W_1)\) (the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall regardless of the actual height), use the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | L) P(L)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, compute \(P(H | W_1)\):

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Therefore, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of witness 1, is approximately 0.4138.
