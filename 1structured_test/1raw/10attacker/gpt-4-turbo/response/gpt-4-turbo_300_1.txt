To estimate this probability, we use Bayesian reasoning, which involves updating prior probabilities based on new evidence. In this case, we'll use two pieces of evidence: the witness testimonies regarding the attacker's height.

First, let's designate the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (Prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

The likelihood of each witness's statements given the attacker's height can be calculated based on the reliability of their testimonies:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time and incorrect 20% of the time:
  - \( P(\text{W1 says tall} \mid H) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(\text{W1 says short} \mid H) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(\text{W1 says tall} \mid L) = 0.20 \)
  - \( P(\text{W1 says short} \mid L) = 0.80 \)
  
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time and incorrect 30% of the time:
  - \( P(\text{W2 says tall} \mid H) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(\text{W2 says short} \mid H) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(\text{W2 says tall} \mid L) = 0.30 \)
  - \( P(\text{W2 says short} \mid L) = 0.70 \)

We calculate the likelihood of the combined witness statement where Witness 1 says the attacker is tall, and Witness 2 says the attacker is short:
- For H (height ≥ 185 cm):
  \[ P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short} \mid H) = P(\text{W1 tall} \mid H) \times P(\text{W2 short} \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

- For L (height < 185 cm):
  \[ P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short} \mid L) = P(\text{W1 tall} \mid L) \times P(\text{W2 short} \mid L) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Now, using Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of H, given the testimony of both witnesses, is given by:
\[ P(H \mid \text{W1 tall, W2 short}) = \frac{P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short} \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short})} \]

Where, 
\[ P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short}) = P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short} \mid H) \times P(H) + P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short} \mid L) \times P(L) \]
\[ P(\text{W1 tall, W2 short}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Therefore, 
\[ P(H \mid \text{W1 tall, W2 short}) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} ≈ 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given contrasting witness statements, is about 0.232.
