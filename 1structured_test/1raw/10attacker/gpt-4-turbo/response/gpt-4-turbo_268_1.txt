To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem. We denote the event that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller as $A$ and the testimonies of the first and second witnesses as $W_1$ and $W_2$, respectively.

We know:
1. The unconditional probability $P(A) = 0.15$ (15% are 185 cm or taller).
2. The unconditional probability $P(A^c) = 0.85$ (85% are shorter than 185 cm).
3. Probability of first witness getting it right ($P(W_1 | A)$) = 0.80 and probability of getting it wrong ($P(W_1 | A^c)$) = 0.20.
4. Probability of second witness getting it right ($P(W_2 | A^c)$) = 0.70 and probability of getting it wrong ($P(W_2 | A)$) = 0.30.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies can be found by:
$$
P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
$$
Where:
- $P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) P(W_2 | A)$ because witnesses' observations are assumed independent given $A$.
- $P(W_1, W_2 | A^c) = P(W_1 | A^c) P(W_2 | A^c)$ using the same independence assumption.
- $P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | A^c) P(A^c)$ by the law of total probability.

Calculating each term:
- $P(W_1, W_2 | A) = 0.80 * 0.30 = 0.24$
- $P(W_1, W_2 | A^c) = 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14$
- $P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 * 0.15) + (0.14 * 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155$

Thus,
$$
P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 * 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.23226
$$

This calculation assumes that the events the witnesses declare are independent when conditioned on $A$ or $A^c$, which might not be realistic in real-life settings, depending on various factors like environmental visibility, witness positioning, etc. However, given the information provided, this is a mathematically reasonable approach. 

Thus, my final answer is:
{probability: 0.23226}
