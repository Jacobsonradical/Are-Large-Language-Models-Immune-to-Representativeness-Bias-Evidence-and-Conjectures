To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness reports and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. 

1. **Let's define:**
   - \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( L \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( W_1 \): First witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( W_2 \): Second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. **Given probabilities:**
   - \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(L) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

3. **Accuracy of witnesses:**
   - \( P(W_1 | H) \) = 0.8 (First witness identifies correctly 80% of the time when the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(W_1 | L) \) = 0.2 (First witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are not)
   - \( P(W_2 | H) \) = 0.3 (Second witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as shorter 30% of the time when they are not)
   - \( P(W_2 | L) \) = 0.7 (Second witness identifies correctly 70% of the time when the attacker is shorter)

4. **Using Bayes' Theorem for \( W_1 \):**
   \[
   P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
   \]
   where \( P(W_1) \) (probability of witness 1 claiming the height as 185 cm or taller) is calculated as:
   \[
   P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | L) \times P(L) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85)
   \]
   \[
   P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
   \]

5. **Calculate \( P(H | W_1) \):**
   \[
   P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
   \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is about 0.4138.
