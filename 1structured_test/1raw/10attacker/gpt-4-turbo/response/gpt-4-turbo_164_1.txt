To solve this problem, we use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to adjust probabilities given new evidence. Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and let \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) be the events representing the observations of the first and second witness respectively, where \( E_1 \) is that the attacker was observed to be 185 cm or taller, and \( E_2 \) that the attacker was observed to be shorter than 185 cm.

Given from the problem:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller = 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability the attacker was shorter than 185 cm = 0.85 (85%).

From the witnesses' abilities:
- First witness: \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \) and \( P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (20% error implies a 20% chance to mistakenly judge a shorter person as tall).
- Second witness: \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \) and \( P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \).

We are required to calculate \( P(H | E_1) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given that the first witness observed the attacker to be 185 cm or taller.

Using the Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1)}
\]

To find \( P(E_1) \) (the total probability of witness 1 observing the attacker to be 185 cm or taller), we use the law of total probability:
\[
P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(E_1) = (0.80 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Substituting these values into Bayes' Theorem:
\[
P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.80 * 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

The estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimony of the first witness, is approximately:
\[
\{ \text{probability}: 0.414 \}
\]
