To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We start by assigning probabilities based on the available data:

Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) represent the event "first witness claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller".
Let \( W_2 \) represent the event "second witness claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm".

From the data:
- \( P(H) \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(H^c) \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

The first witness identifies correct height 80% of the time, hence:
- \( P(W_1|H) \) (probability witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8.
- \( P(W_1|H^c) \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.2. 

The second witness identifies correct height 70% of the time, hence:
- \( P(W_2|H^c) \) (probability witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.7.
- \( P(W_2|H) \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we calculate the posterior probability \( P(H|W_1, W_2) \) as follows:
\[
P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]
with:
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2|H) \times P(H) + P(W_1, W_2|H^c) \times P(H^c)
\]
where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(W_2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2|H^c) = P(W_1|H^c) \times P(W_2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]
Finally:
\[
P(H|W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226
\]

Thus, given the witness statements and their reliability:
{probability: 0.23226}
