To solve this problem, we will employ Bayes' Theorem, which provides a way to update our probability estimate based on new evidence. Specifically, we want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witness' statements.

Let's define:
- \(H\) as the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg H\) as the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

First, let's start with the prior probabilities:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\): the probability that a random person in the city is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\): the probability that a random person is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the data:
- Witness 1 has an 80% chance of correctly identifying if someone is 185 cm or taller and a 20% chance of incorrectly saying they are shorter than 185 cm when they are not.
- Witness 2 has a 70% chance of correctly identifying someone as shorter than 185 cm and a 30% chance of incorrectly saying they are 185 cm or taller when they are not.

We compute:
- \(P(W_1 | H)\): Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies that someone is 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \(P(W_1 | \neg H)\): Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller = 0.2.
- \(P(W_2 | H)\): Probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 0.3.
- \(P(W_2 | \neg H)\): Probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm = 0.7.

Using the law of total probability, we compute the probability of both witnesses giving their respective testimonies:
- \( P(W_1 \land W_2) = P(W_1 \land W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \land W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(W_1 \land W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H)P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \land W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H)P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Thus:
- \( P(W_1 \land W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Now, we apply Bayes' theorem to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both testimonies:
- \( P(H | W_1 \land W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \land W_2 | H)P(H)}{P(W_1 \land W_2)} \)
- \( P(H | W_1 \land W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses, is:
