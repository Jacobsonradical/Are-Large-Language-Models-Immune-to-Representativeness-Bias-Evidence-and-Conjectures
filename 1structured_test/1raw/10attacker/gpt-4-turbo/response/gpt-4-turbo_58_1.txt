To find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the statements of the witnesses and the demographic information, we can make use of Bayes' theorem. It allows us to update our prior probability beliefs in light of new evidence. Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. 

1. **Prior Probability**, \( P(H) \):
   - From the statement, 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).

2. **Likelihoods**:
   - **Witness 1** said the attacker was 185 cm or taller. The probability that Witness 1 is correct (given \( H \)) is 80%, and the probability that he is incorrect (given not \( H \), i.e., the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) is 20%. So, \( P(\text{W1} | H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(\text{W1} | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
   - **Witness 2** said the attacker was shorter than 185 cm. The probability that Witness 2 is correct (given not \( H \)) is 70%, and the probability that she is incorrect (given \( H \)) is 30%. So, \( P(\text{W2} | \neg H) = 0.7 \) and \( P(\text{W2} | H) = 0.3 \).

3. Compute **Total Evidence** for and against \( H \):
   - By the law of total probability, the likelihood of Witness 1 saying the attacker was 185 cm or taller is:
     \[
     P(\text{W1}) = P(\text{W1} | H) P(H) + P(\text{W1} | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
     \]
   - Similarly, calculate \( P(\text{W2}) \) to find the likelihood of Witness 2 claiming the attacker was shorter than 185 cm:
     \[
     P(\text{W2}) = P(\text{W2} | H) P(H) + P(\text{W2} | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64
     \]

4. **Applying Bayes' Theorem**:
   - The probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimony:
     \[
     P(H | \text{W1}, \text{W2}) = \frac{P(\text{W1}, \text{W2} | H) P(H)}{P(\text{W1}, \text{W2})}
     \]
     - Where:
       \[
       P(\text{W1}, \text{W2}) = P(\text{W1}, \text{W2} | H) P(H) + P(\text{W1}, \text{W2} | \neg H) P(\neg H) = \left( 0.8 \times 0.3 \right) \times 0.15 + \left( 0.2 \times 0.7 \right) \times 0.85 = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
       \]
   - So,
     \[
     P(H | \text{W1}, \text{W2}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
     \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, taking into account the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.232.
