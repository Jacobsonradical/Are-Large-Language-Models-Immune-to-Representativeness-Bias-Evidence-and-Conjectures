To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define \( A \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( B \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller. We will also consider the statement of the second witness.

The probability values needed are:

1. \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, which is given as 15% or 0.15.
2. \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% or 0.85.
3. \( P(B | A) \), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller. According to the data, the first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, so this probability is 0.8.
4. \( P(B | A^c) \), the probability that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually shorter than 185 cm. Since the first witness makes an error 20% of the time, this probability is 0.2.

Now, apply Bayes' theorem to find \( P(A | B) \):
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
Where \( P(B) \) is the total probability of witness B claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(B) = P(B | A) P(A) + P(B | A^c) P(A^c)
\]
Plugging in the numbers:
\[
P(B) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

We can now calculate \( P(A | B) \):
\[
P(A | B) = \frac{(0.8 \times 0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

There is approximately a 41.38% chance that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim.
