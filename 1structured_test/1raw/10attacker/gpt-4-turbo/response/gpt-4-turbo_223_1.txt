To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian probability principles. We will compute the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses (Witness 1 and Witness 2).

Define the following events:
- \( A \) is the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) is the event that Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) is the event that Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

We need the probabilities:
- \( P(A) \), the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, provided as 15% \( (0.15) \).
- \( P(A^c) \), the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is \( 1 - P(A) = 0.85 \).
- \( P(B \mid A) \), the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller, is 80% \( (0.8) \).
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \), the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies the shorter attacker as 185 cm or taller, is 20% \( (0.2) \).
- \( P(C \mid A) \), the probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies the taller attacker as shorter, is 30% \( (0.3) \).
- \( P(C \mid A^c) \), the probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies a shorter attacker as shorter, is 70% \( (0.7) \).

We need to find \( P(A \mid B \cap C) \) - the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both Witness 1's and Witness 2's statements.

Using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:
\[ P(A \mid B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C \mid A) P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} \]
\[ P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C \mid A) P(A) + P(B \cap C \mid A^c) P(A^c) \]
Where:
- \( P(B \cap C \mid A) = P(B \mid A) \times P(C \mid A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(B \cap C \mid A^c) = P(B \mid A^c) \times P(C \mid A^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
\[ P(B \cap C) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus, 
\[ P(A \mid B \cap C) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

The computed probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately 0.232.
