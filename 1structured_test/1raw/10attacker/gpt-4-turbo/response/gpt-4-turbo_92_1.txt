To solve this probability problem, we utilize Bayes' theorem along with the information provided about the population distribution and the witnesses' accuracy.

Let:
\( A \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
\( \neg A \) denote the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
\( W_1 \) denote the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
\( \neg W_1 \) denote the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
\( W_2 \) denote the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
\( \neg W_2 \) denote the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The accuracy of the witnesses:
- Witness 1 has an 80% accuracy, so:
  - \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.8 \) (probability Witness 1 correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(\neg W_1 | A) = 0.2 \)
  - \( P(\neg W_1 | \neg A) = 0.8 \) (probability Witness 1 incorrectly claims the attacker is shorter)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.2 \)

- Witness 2 has a 70% accuracy, so:
  - \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(\neg W_2 | A) = 0.3 \)
  - \( P(\neg W_2 | \neg A) = 0.7 \)
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.3 \)

We need to find \( P(A | W_1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) P(A)}{P(W_1)} \]

Here, \( P(W_1) \) can be found using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) P(A) + P(W_1 | \neg A) P(\neg A) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Calculate \( P(A | W_1) \):
\[ P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability estimate that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given Witness 1's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
