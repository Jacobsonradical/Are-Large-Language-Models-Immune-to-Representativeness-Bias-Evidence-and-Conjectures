To solve this question and find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and their accuracies in judging heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller) based on new evidence (witnesses' testimonies).

First, let us define:
- \( H \): Hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): Witness 1's statement that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Witness 2's statement that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information given:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Regarding the witnesses:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time:
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability Witness 1 is right given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability Witness 1 is wrong, saying tall when the attacker is not)
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time:
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability Witness 2 is wrong, saying short when the attacker is tall)
  - \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability Witness 2 is right given the attacker is shorter)

We are looking for the probability that the attacker is tall given both witnesses' statements:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) \]

Using the law of total probability and Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]
Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Given that the testimonies are independent:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 × 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 × 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Now calculating:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = (0.24 × 0.15) + (0.14 × 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 × 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately:
{probability: 0.232}
