To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. We need to combine the assessment probabilities of the witnesses with the population data we have about heights.

1. **Define Prior Probability**:
   - Let \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Define Likelihoods based on Witness Testimonies**:
   - **First Witness (W1)** claims 185 cm or taller and is right 80% of the time.
     - \( P(W1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Correct when H true)
     - \( P(W1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (Incorrect when H false)
   - **Second Witness (W2)** claims shorter than 185 cm but is right 70% of the time.
     - \( P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Correct when H false)
     - \( P(W2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Incorrect when H true)

3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to Update the Probability**:
   - We calculate the probability of \( H \) given both witnesses' statements:
     \[
     P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1, W2)}
     \]
   - Since the witnesses are independent with respect to their observations:
     \[
     P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \times P(W2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
     \]
     \[
     P(W1, W2 | \neg H) = P(W1 | \neg H) \times P(W2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Probability \( P(W1, W2) \)** using the law of total probability:
    \[
    P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W1, W2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H)
            = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
            = 0.036 + 0.119
            = 0.155
    \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
    \[
    P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232258
    \]
    This probability shows the chance of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies.

So, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to this analysis, accounting for both witnesses' estimates, is:
```{probability: 0.232258}```
