To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which updates the probability estimate based on new evidence. We denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as A and the opposite as not A. We also denote the testimony of the first witness as W1 and the second witness as W2. 

Let's summarize the given data:
- P(A) (Prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- P(not A) = 0.85 (opposite of P(A)).
- The first witness W1 states the attacker is 185 cm or taller and judges such people correctly 80% of the time: P(W1|A) = 0.80.
- Also, W1 states incorrectly that a person shorter than 185 cm is taller in 20% of cases: P(W1|not A) = 0.20.
- The second witness W2 states the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and judges such people correctly 70% of the time: P(W2|not A) = 0.70.
- Also, W2 states incorrectly that a person taller than 185 cm is shorter in 30% of cases: P(W2|A) = 0.30.

We are interested in the probability P(A|W1), which is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so. 

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(A|W1) = \frac{P(W1|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W1)} \]

To find \(P(W1)\), we use the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|A) \cdot P(A) + P(W1|not A) \cdot P(not A) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80) \cdot (0.15) + (0.20) \cdot (0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then,
\[ P(A|W1) = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the updated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's testimony, is approximately 0.4138.
