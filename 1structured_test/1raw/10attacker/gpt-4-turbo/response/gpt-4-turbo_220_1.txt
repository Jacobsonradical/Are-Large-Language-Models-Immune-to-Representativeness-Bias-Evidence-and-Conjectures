To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller using the provided information, we need to use Bayesian reasoning with conditional probabilities. We denote:
- \( H_1 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( H_2 \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
1. \( P(H_1) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(H_2) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness identifies the right height about 80% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W_1 \mid H_1) = 0.8 \) (probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they actually are)
- \( P(W_1 \mid H_2) = 0.2 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that they are not)

The second witness identifies the right height about 70% of the time. Therefore:
- \( P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.3 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker is shorter given that they are not)
- \( P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.7 \) (probability that the second witness correctly claims the attacker is shorter given that they actually are)

To find \( P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) \), we use Bayesâ€™ theorem in conjunction with the law of total probability:

\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

First, calculate \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) = P(W_1 \mid H_1) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H_1) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

Then \( P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) = P(W_1 \mid H_2) \cdot P(W_2 \mid H_2) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1, W_2 \mid H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

This implies:
- \( P(H_1 \mid W_1, W_2) = 0.232 \)

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately 0.232.
