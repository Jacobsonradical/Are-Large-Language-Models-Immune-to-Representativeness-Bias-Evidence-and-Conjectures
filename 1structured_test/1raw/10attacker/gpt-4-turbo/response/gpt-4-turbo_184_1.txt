To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability. Let's define \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) as the events that the first and second witness claim the attacker is 185 cm or taller, respectively.

The given probabilities are:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (where \( \neg H \) is the probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).
- According to the witnesses' accuracy:
  - First witness (claims attacker is 185 cm or taller): \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (correct) and \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (incorrect).
  - Second witness (claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm): \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (correct) and \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (incorrect).

We can use these probabilities to find \( P(H | W_1) \) and \( P(H | W_2) \). Applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]
\[ P(H | W_2) = \frac{P(W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_2)} \]

We also need to find \( P(W_1) \) and \( P(W_2) \) using the law of total probability:

\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_2) = P(W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]

Calculating \( P(W_1) \):
\[ P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Calculating \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Calculating \( P(W_2) \):
\[ P(W_2) = (0.30 \times 0.15) + (0.70 \times 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Calculating \( P(H | W_2) \):
\[ P(H | W_2) = \frac{0.30 \times 0.15}{0.64} = \frac{0.045}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

Given the contradicting claims of the two witnesses, we might instead prefer to use the probability from the witness who believed the attacker was taller, focusing on \( P(H | W_1) \) as it relates directly to the first witness's claim that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138 (to a reasonable degree of rounding).
