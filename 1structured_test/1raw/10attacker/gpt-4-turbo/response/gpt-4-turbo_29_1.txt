To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let us denote:
- \(H\) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(\neg H\) as the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \(W_1\) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \(W_2\) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

We know the following:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\neg H) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The ability of witness 1 to correctly judge height is:
- \(P(W_1 | H) = 0.8\) (Witness 1 is correct about a tall person 80% of the time)
- \(P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2\) (Witness 1 mistakenly judges a short person as tall 20% of the time)

The ability of witness 2 to correctly judge height is:
- \(P(W_2 | H) = 0.3\) (Witness 2 mistakenly judges a tall person as short 30% of the time)
- \(P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7\) (Witness 2 is correct about a short person 70% of the time)

We need to derive the following: 
- Calculate \(P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)\) and \(P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)\).
- Calculate \(P(W_1 \cap W_2)\).

Using independence between witness testimonies given the height condition:
- \(P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24\)
- \(P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14\)

Using Law of Total Probability:
- \(P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\)

Finally, we apply Bayes' Theorem:
- \(P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.2323\)

Thus the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, given both witness statements, is 0.2323.
