To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses and the general population data on height, we should use Bayes' theorem. 

Bayes' theorem states:
\[ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \]
Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of A (attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B \mid A) \) is the likelihood of B given A (witnesses' accuracy when the attacker is 185 cm or taller),
- \( P(B) \) is the total probability of B (witnesses' statements).

Given:
- \( P(\text{attacker $\geq$ 185cm}) = 0.15 \) 
- \( P(\text{attacker < 185cm}) = 0.85 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 1 correct}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 1 incorrect}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 correct}) = 0.70 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 incorrect}) = 0.30 \)

We calculate:
- \( P(\text{witness 1 says $\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ $\geq$ 185cm}) = 0.80 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 1 says $\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ < 185cm}) = 0.20 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 says < 185cm $\mid$ $\geq$ 185cm}) = 0.30 \)
- \( P(\text{witness 2 says < 185cm $\mid$ < 185cm}) = 0.70 \)

Calculate \( P(B) \):
\[ P(B) = P(\text{w1 says $\geq$ 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{w2 says < 185cm}) \]
\[ = [P(\text{w1 says $\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ $\geq$ 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{$\geq$ 185cm}) + P(\text{w1 says $\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ < 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{< 185cm})] \cdot [P(\text{w2 says < 185cm $\mid$ $\geq$ 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{$\geq$ 185cm}) + P(\text{w2 says < 185cm $\mid$ < 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{< 185cm})] \]
\[ = [0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85] \cdot [0.30 \cdot 0.15 + 0.70 \cdot 0.85] \]
\[ = [0.12 + 0.17] \cdot [0.045 + 0.595] \]
\[ = 0.29 \cdot 0.64 \]
\[ = 0.1856 \]

Calculate \( P(A \mid B) \):
\[ P(\text{$\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ B}) = \frac{P(\text{w1 $\geq$ 185cm, w2 < 185cm $\mid$ $\geq$ 185cm}) \cdot P(\text{$\geq$ 185cm})}{P(B)} \]
\[ = \frac{(0.80 \cdot 0.30) \cdot 0.15}{0.1856} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.1856} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.1856} \]
\[ \approx 0.194 \]

Thus, the probability \( P(\text{$\geq$ 185cm $\mid$ B}) \) is approximately 0.194.

Therefore:
{probability: 0.194}
