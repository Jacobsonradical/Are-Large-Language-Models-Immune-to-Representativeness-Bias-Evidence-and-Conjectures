To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which helps us to update our probability estimate on the height of the attacker based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses.

Let:
- \( A \) = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( A^c \) = Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) = Witness 1's evidence (claims attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( W_2 \) = Witness 2's evidence (claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

According to the problem:
- \( P(A) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(A^c) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the description of the witnesses' accuracies:
- \( P(W_1 | A) \) = 0.80 (Probability witness 1 is correct if the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1 | A^c) \) = 0.20 (Probability witness 1 says 185 cm or taller when the attacker is shorter).
- \( P(W_2 | A) \) = 0.30 (Probability witness 2 says shorter when the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2 | A^c) \) = 0.70 (Probability witness 2 is correct if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm).

Also, the witnesses are providing evidence independently. We must calculate the probability of their observations given the two scenarios (the attacker being 185 cm or taller, and the attacker being shorter than 185 cm).

Calculating the combined probability of \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) occurring under each scenario:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) = P(W_1 | A^c) \times P(W_2 | A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

Then using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]
Here, \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) (marginal probability of witnesses' observations) is calculated as:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | A^c) \times P(A^c) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now, applying Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(A | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.232258 \]

Therefore, based on both witnessesâ€™ accounts, the estimated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.232258, or 23.23%.
