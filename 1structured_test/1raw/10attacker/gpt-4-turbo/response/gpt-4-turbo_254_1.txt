To solve this question, we will use Bayesian probability to update our prior belief about the probability of the attacker's height based on the witness testimonies. 

**Let:**
- \( P(H) \) be the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller. From the problem statement, this is 15%, or 0.15.
- \( P(L) \) be the probability that the attacker's height was shorter than 185 cm. This is therefore 85%, or 0.85.

**Witness Reports:**
- Witness 1 (W1) claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and is correct about height 80% of the time whether the person is tall or short.
- Witness 2 (W2) claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and is correct about height 70% of the time whether the person is tall or short.

**Bayesian Update:**
- \( P(W1 | H) \) = Probability Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is tall = 80% = 0.8
- \( P(W1 | L) \) = Probability Witness 1 is incorrect given the attacker is short = 20% = 0.2
- \( P(W2 | H) \) = Probability Witness 2 is incorrect given the attacker is tall = 30% = 0.3
- \( P(W2 | L) \) = Probability Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is short = 70% = 0.7

Witnesses give conflicting reports so we consider the probability of both reports being what they are under each height scenario. 

**Apply the Law of Total Probability:**
Calculate each joint probability:
- \( P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H) \times P(W2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W1, W2 | L) = P(W1 | L) \times P(W2 | L) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Calculate updated beliefs:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1, W2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W1, W2 | L) \times P(L)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{(0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.036 + 0.119} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, after considering the witness testimonies and initial population data:

**{probability: 0.232}**
