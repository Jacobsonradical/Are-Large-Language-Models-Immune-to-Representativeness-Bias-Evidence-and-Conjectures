To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on available information, we apply Bayes' Rule. Bayes' Rule allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence, which in this case are the witnesses' statements.

Let:
- \( H \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_1 \) be the evidence that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) be the evidence that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

From the data:
- Prior probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- Prior probability \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Accuracy of the witnesses:
- The first witness has 80% accuracy: \( P(E_1|H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(E_1|\neg H) = 0.2 \)
- The second witness has 70% accuracy: \( P(E_2|\neg H) = 0.7 \) and \( P(E_2|H) = 0.3 \)

We need to find \( P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) \) - the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Applying the law of total probability for the evidences:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2|H)P(H) + P(E_1 \cap E_2|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2|H) = P(E_1|H)P(E_2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2|\neg H) = P(E_1|\neg H)P(E_2|\neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now plug these into the total probability:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now apply Bayes' Rule:
\[ P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2|H) P(H)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]
\[ P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given both witness statements, is approximately 0.232.

However, if using the first witness's claim alone:
\[ P(H|E_1) = \frac{P(E_1|H) P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1|H)P(H) + P(E_1|\neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(E_1) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(H|E_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.414 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, based solely on the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.414.
