To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which allows us to update our probability estimate for an event based on new evidence. First, let's denote the following:

- \( H \): The attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \lnot H \): The attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The first witness claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The second witness claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller, is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(\lnot H) \), the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, is 0.85 (85%).

According to the witnesses' abilities:
- \( P(W_1 | H) \), the probability that the first witness correctly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller, is 0.80.
- \( P(W_1 | \lnot H) \), the probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.20.
- \( P(W_2 | \lnot H) \), the probability that the second witness correctly claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 0.70.
- \( P(W_2 | H) \), the probability that the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 0.30.

Now, based on Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so. Bayes' Theorem states:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of the first witness claiming the attacker's height as 185 cm or taller, which can be calculated using the Law of Total Probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \lnot H) \times P(\lnot H)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is approximately 0.4138.
