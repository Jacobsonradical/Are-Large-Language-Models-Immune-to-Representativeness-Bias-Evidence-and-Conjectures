To solve this problem, we can use Bayesian statistics to update our belief about the height of the attacker given the evidence presented by the witnesses. We start with the prior probability that the attacker’s height is 185 cm or taller, and then update this probability based on the witness statements. 

Let:
- \( H \) = Event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( \neg H \) = Event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 \) = Event that Witness 1 correctly identifies attacker as 185 cm or taller
- \( W2 \) = Event that Witness 2 correctly identifies attacker as shorter than 185 cm

From the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population)
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1's accuracy if attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1's error rate if attacker is shorter)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2's error rate if attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2's accuracy if attacker is shorter)

We need to find \( P(H|W1) \) and \( P(H|W2) \), the updated probabilities considering witnesses' testimonies.

#### Calculating \( P(H|W1) \), the probability the attacker is ≥185 cm given that Witness 1 said so
\[ P(W1) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.8 \cdot 0.15) + (0.2 \cdot 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W1) = \frac{P(W1|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1)} \]
\[ P(H|W1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

#### Calculating \( P(H|W2) \), the probability the attacker is ≥185 cm given that Witness 2 said they were shorter
\[ P(W2) = P(W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W2|\neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W2) = (0.3 \cdot 0.15) + (0.7 \cdot 0.85) = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W2) = \frac{P(W2|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W2)} \]
\[ P(H|W2) = \frac{0.3 \cdot 0.15}{0.64} \approx 0.0703 \]

Given the conflicting testimony, these individual probabilities need to be consolidated. However, the question specifically asks for the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given only the first witness’s testimony. 

Thus, our final estimate based only on the first witness’s testimony is:
\[{probability: 0.4138}\]
