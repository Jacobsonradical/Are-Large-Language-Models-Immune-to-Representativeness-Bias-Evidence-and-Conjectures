To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witness statements, we use Bayes' theorem. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the calculations:

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event where Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event where Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies tall people 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies short people 70% of the time)

We seek \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability the attacker is tall given both witnesses' statements.

By Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, we have:
\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
\]
We can expand \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \) as:
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H)P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24
\]
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H)P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14
\]

Then, using the law of total probability for \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[
P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
\[
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
\]
\[
= 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]
Now we can compute \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \):
\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, according to the witness claims and given statistics, is approximately 0.23226.
