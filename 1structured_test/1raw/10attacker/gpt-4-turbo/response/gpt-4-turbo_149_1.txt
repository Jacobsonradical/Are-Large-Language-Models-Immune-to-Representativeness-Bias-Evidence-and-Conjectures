To solve this problem, we'll apply Bayes' Theorem, which will help us to update our prior belief about the attacker's height based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses. The theorem is given by:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the posterior probability (the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements).
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability (the probability of being 185 cm or taller without the witnesses’ statements).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood (the probability of the witnesses' statements given the attacker's height).
- \( P(E) \) is the marginal likelihood (the probability of the witnesses' statements under all possible attacker heights).

Let:
- \( H \) = "attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( L \) = "attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \( W1 \) = "first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller"
- \( W2 \) = "second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm"
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)

We know from the problem:
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 correctly identifies taller individuals)
- \( P(W1|L) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as being taller)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 incorrectly identifies taller individuals as being shorter)
- \( P(W2|L) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 correctly identifies shorter individuals)

The witnesses contradict each other, hence we treat their evidences as independent:
- \( P(W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) + P(W1|L)P(L) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)
- \( P(W2) = P(W2|H)P(H) + P(W2|L)P(L) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \)

We now focus solely on \( W1 \) (first witness’ claim) and want the posterior probability of \( H \) given \( W1 \):
\[ P(H|W1) = \frac{P(W1|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W1)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} ≈ 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness’s claim, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
