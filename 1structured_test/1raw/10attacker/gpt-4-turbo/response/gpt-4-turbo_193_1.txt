To solve this problem, let's use Bayes' Theorem to combine the witness testimonies with the population's height distribution. Let \( A \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller and \( B \) the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. We want to calculate \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) \), where \( W_1 \) is the event that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) is the event that the second witness incorrectly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(B) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- The first witness identifies correctly 80% of the time:
  - \( P(W_1|A) = 0.8 \), \( P(W_1|B) = 0.2 \).
- The second witness identifies correctly 70% of the time:
  - \( P(W_2|A) = 0.3 \), \( P(W_2|B) = 0.7 \).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we find \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) \) as follows:

\[
P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2|A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
\]

1. Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|A) \) and \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|B) \):
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|A) = P(W_1|A) \times P(W_2|A) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \).
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2|B) = P(W_1|B) \times P(W_2|B) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \).

2. Calculate \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) using total probability theorem:
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2|A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 \cap W_2|B) \times P(B) \).
   - \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \).

3. Thus, \( P(A|W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \).

Based on the given information and calculations, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' accounts, is approximately \( 0.232 \).
