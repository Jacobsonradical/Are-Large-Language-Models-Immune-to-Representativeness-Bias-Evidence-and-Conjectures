To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was indeed 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy along with the general height distribution in the city, we can use Bayes' Theorem.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
Where:
- \( H \) is the hypothesis (attacker was 185 cm or taller).
- \( E \) is the evidence provided (testimony).

Let:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) (probability first witness is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (probability first witness is wrong given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \) (probability second witness is wrong given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) (probability second witness is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Using independence assumption between witnesses, the combined evidence \( E \) given \( H \) combines the probabilities of \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \):
\[ P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.8 \cdot 0.3 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E \mid \neg H) = P(E_1 \mid \neg H) \cdot P(E_2 \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \cdot 0.7 = 0.14 \]

To compute \( P(E) \):
\[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)} \]
\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{0.24 \cdot 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.232258 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is:

{probability: 0.232258}
