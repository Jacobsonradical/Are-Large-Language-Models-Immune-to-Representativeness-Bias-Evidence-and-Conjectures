To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem which computes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Here is a solution step-by-step:

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% are shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1 accuracy:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (correct when attacker is tall)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (incorrectly claims tall when attacker is short)

Witness 2 accuracy:
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (correct when attacker is short)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (incorrectly claims short when attacker is tall)

Using Bayes' theorem for \( P(H | W_1) \):
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H)
      = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85
      = 0.12 + 0.17 
      = 0.29
\]

Then:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:

  "probability": 0.4138
