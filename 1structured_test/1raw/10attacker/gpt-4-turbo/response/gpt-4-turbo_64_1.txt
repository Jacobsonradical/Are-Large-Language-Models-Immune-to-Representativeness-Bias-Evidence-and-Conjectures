To solve this, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which tells us how to update our belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. In this case, we want to find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimony of both witnesses. Let's define:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that Witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that Witness 2 claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- We are given that the probability \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time (\( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \)) and incorrectly 20% of the time (\( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \)).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time (\( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \)) and incorrectly 30% of the time (\( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \)).

We need to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies. By Bayes' Theorem and the law of total probability,

\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)}
\]

We calculate these as follows:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
- Using the law of total probability, \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Now plugging these into Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses, is approximately 0.232.

Returning it in your specified format:
