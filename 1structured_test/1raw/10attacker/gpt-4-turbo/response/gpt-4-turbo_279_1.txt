To solve this problem, we will apply Bayes' Theorem, which is used to update the probability estimate of a hypothesis after obtaining new evidence. Let's define \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, and \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) as the evidence provided by the first and the second witness, respectively.

From the information given:
- Probability that someone in the population is 185 cm or taller (prior probability, \( P(H) \)) = 0.15.
- Probability that someone in the population is shorter than 185 cm (prior probability, \( P(\neg H) \)) = 0.85.

The first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller and has a 80% correct identification rate for this height, so:
- \( P(E_1 | H) \) (probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is indeed that height) = 0.80.
- \( P(E_1 | \neg H) \) (probability of witness 1 saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the attacker is shorter) = 0.20.

The second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and has a 70% correct identification rate for being shorter than 185 cm, so:
- \( P(E_2 | \neg H) \) = 0.70.
- \( P(E_2 | H) \) = 0.30.

We use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of both witnesses.

\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1, E_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]

Assuming independence between testimonies given the height:
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) \times P(E_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) \times P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

The total probability of observing \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) (law of total probability):
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1, E_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(E_1, E_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Now we can substitute this information back into Bayes' formula:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, your estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, should be:
{probability: 0.232}
