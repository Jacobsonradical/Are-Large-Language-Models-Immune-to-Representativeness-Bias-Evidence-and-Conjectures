To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief based on new evidence. In this scenario, the likelihood of a witness correctly identifying someone’s height (either ≥185 cm or <185 cm) provides the additional information needed to update probabilities.

### Step 1: Define the Prior Probability
- **Probability of Attacker ≥ 185 cm (H1):** P(H1) = 0.15 (since 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- **Probability of Attacker < 185 cm (H2):** P(H2) = 0.85 (since 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

### Step 2: Define the Likelihoods based on Witnesses
**Witness 1:**
- **Correctly identifies ≥185 cm:** 80% (P(Report1 = H1 | H1))
- **Incorrectly identifies <185 cm:** 20% (P(Report1 = H2 | H1))
- **Correctly identifies <185 cm:** 80% (P(Report1 = H2 | H2))
- **Incorrectly identifies ≥185 cm:** 20% (P(Report1 = H1 | H2))

**Witness 2:**
- **Correctly identifies ≥185 cm:** 70% (P(Report2 = H1 | H1))
- **Incorrectly identifies <185 cm:** 30% (P(Report2 = H2 | H1))
- **Correctly identifies <185 cm:** 70% (P(Report2 = H2 | H2))
- **Incorrectly identifies ≥185 cm:** 30% (P(Report2 = H1 | H2))

### Step 3: Apply Bayes’ Theorem
We need to calculate the posterior probability P(H1 | Report1 = H1, Report2 = H2), the probability that the attacker's height is ≥185 cm given the conflicting reports from the witnesses.

Using the law of total probability combined with Bayes’ rule:

**P(H1 | Report1 = H1, Report2 = H2)** = 
\[
\frac{P(Report1 = H1 | H1) \times P(Report2 = H2 | H1) \times P(H1)}{P(Report1 = H1, Report2 = H2)}
\]

Where the denominator, P(Report1 = H1, Report2 = H2), is:
\[
P(Report1 = H1 | H1) \times P(Report2 = H2 | H1) \times P(H1) + P(Report1 = H1 | H2) \times P(Report2 = H2 | H2) \times P(H2)
\]

Filling in the probabilities:

**Numerator:**
- = \(0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15\)
- = 0.036

**Denominator:**
- = \(0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85\)
- = 0.036 + 0.119
- = 0.155

Thus, **P(H1 | Report1 = H1, Report2 = H2)** = \( \frac{0.036}{0.155} \) ≈ 0.232

### Conclusion
The updated probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given the reports of both witnesses, is approximately **0.232**.
