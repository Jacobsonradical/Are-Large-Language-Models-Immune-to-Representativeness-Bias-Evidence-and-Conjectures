To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. This theorem updates the probability of a hypothesis, based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller. Let us denote:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W1 \) as the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W2 \) as the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the information provided:

- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

The witnesses’ accuracies give us:

- \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 is right about height ≥ 185 cm 80% of the time).
- \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 errs, i.e., labels someone shorter than 185 cm as taller, 20% of the time).
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 errs, i.e., labels someone taller than 185 cm as shorter, 30% of the time).
- \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 is right about height <185 cm 70% of the time).

We want to find \( P(H|W1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 claims so. Using Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H|W1) = \frac{P(W1|H)P(H)}{P(W1)}
\]
Where:
\[
P(W1) = P(W1|H)P(H) + P(W1|\neg H)P(\neg H)
\]
Calculating \( P(W1) \):

\[
P(W1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Thus, 

\[
P(H|W1) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given that the first witness claimed so, is about 0.4138.
