To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes' theorem which helps us calculate conditional probability using the provided data. We want to find the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting reports of the two witnesses.

Here's the notation we'll use:
- Let \(A\) denote the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \(\overline{A}\) denote the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \(W_1\) denote the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \(W_2\) denote the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

First, from the provided data:
- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\overline{A}) = 0.85\) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From the witness reliability data, we derive the following conditional probabilities:
- \(P(W_1 | A) = 0.8\) (Witness 1 is correct about a taller person 80% of the time)
- \(P(W_1 | \overline{A}) = 0.2\) (Witness 1 is correct about a shorter person being tall, incorrectly, 20% of the time)
- \(P(W_2 | A) = 0.3\) (Witness 2 is correct about a taller person being short, incorrectly, 30% of the time)
- \(P(W_2 | \overline{A}) = 0.7\) (Witness 2 is correct about a shorter person 70% of the time)

Now, using Bayes' theorem to find \(P(A | W_1)\), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that Witness 1 observed the attacker as 185 cm or taller:
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W_1)}
\]
Where \(P(W_1)\) – the total probability that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller – can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | A) \times P(A) + P(W_1 | \overline{A}) \times P(\overline{A}) = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]
Thus:
\[
P(A | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as per the first witness's claim, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
