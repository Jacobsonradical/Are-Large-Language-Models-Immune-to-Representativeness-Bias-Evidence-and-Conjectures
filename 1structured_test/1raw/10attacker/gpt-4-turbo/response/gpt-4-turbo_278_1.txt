To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (event A), we will use Bayes' Theorem, which considers both the witnesses' reliability and the base rates of the height distribution in the population.

Let:
- \( A \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( B \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( C \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Based on the given data:
- \( P(A) \) (probability of being 185 cm or taller) = 0.15.
- \( P(A^c) \) (probability of being shorter than 185 cm) = 0.85.

The reliability of the witnesses suggests the following conditional probabilities:
- \( P(B \mid A) \) (probability witness 1 is correct, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.80.
- \( P(B \mid A^c) \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.20.
- \( P(C \mid A) \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect, given the attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.30.
- \( P(C \mid A^c) \) (probability witness 2 is correct, given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm) = 0.70.

We need to find \( P(A \mid B) \) considering the conflicting statement \( C \). We assume \( B \) and \( C \) are independent given \( A \) or \( A^c \), i.e., the statements made independently:
- \( P(B \cap C \mid A) = P(B \mid A) \times P(C \mid A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(B \cap C \mid A^c) = P(B \mid A^c) \times P(C \mid A^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using total probability theorem:
- \( P(B \cap C) = P(B \cap C \mid A)P(A) + P(B \cap C \mid A^c)P(A^c) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Applying Bayes' Theorem:
- \( P(A \mid B \cap C) = \frac{P(B \cap C \mid A)P(A)}{P(B \cap C)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \)

Therefore, based on the witnesses' statements and the population statistics:
- {probability: 0.232}
