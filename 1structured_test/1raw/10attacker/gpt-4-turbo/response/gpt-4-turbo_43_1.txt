To determine the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' statements and their accuracy, we'll use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our prior beliefs based on new evidence.

Let \( A \) represents the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( B_1 \) and \( B_2 \) represent the observations of the first and second witness, respectively.

Given:
\( \Pr(A) = 0.15 \) – Probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller.
\( \Pr(A^c) = 0.85 \) – Probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is shorter than 185 cm.

\(\Pr(B_1|A) = 0.8\) - Probability that witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller. 
\(\Pr(B_1|A^c) = 0.2\) - Probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller.
\(\Pr(B_2|A) = 0.3\) - Probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm.
\(\Pr(B_2|A^c) = 0.7\) - Probability that witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm.

We use the law of total probability to find \( \Pr(B_1) \) and \( \Pr(B_2) \):

\[ \Pr(B_1) = \Pr(B_1|A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(B_1|A^c) \Pr(A^c) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ \Pr(B_2) = \Pr(B_2|A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(B_2|A^c) \Pr(A^c) = 0.3 \times 0.15 + 0.7 \times 0.85 = 0.045 + 0.595 = 0.64 \]

Next, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( \Pr(A|B_1) \):

\[ \Pr(A|B_1) = \frac{\Pr(B_1|A) \Pr(A)}{\Pr(B_1)} = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is \( \approx 0.4138 \).
