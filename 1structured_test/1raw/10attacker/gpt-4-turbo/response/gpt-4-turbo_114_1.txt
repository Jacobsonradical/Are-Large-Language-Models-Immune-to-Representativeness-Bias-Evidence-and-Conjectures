To solve this problem, we apply Bayes' theorem, which helps to update the initial probability based on new information or evidence. 

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event where the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \overline{H} \) as the event where the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event where the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event where the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the information provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness identifies the correct height about 80% of the time whether the attacker is 185 cm or taller, or shorter than 185 cm. The second witness identifies the correct height about 70% of the time whether the height is 185 cm or taller, or shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that witness 1 correctly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \overline{H}) = 0.20 \) (probability that witness 1 incorrectly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that witness 2 incorrectly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_2 | \overline{H}) = 0.70 \) (probability that witness 2 correctly identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

We need to compute \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \), the probability that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the actual height, is computed by:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \overline{H}) P(\overline{H}) = (0.80)(0.15) + (0.20)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Putting it together:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
