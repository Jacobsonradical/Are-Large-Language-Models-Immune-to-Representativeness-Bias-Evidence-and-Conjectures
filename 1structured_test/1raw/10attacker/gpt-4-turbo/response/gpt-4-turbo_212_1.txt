To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witnesses' testimonies.

Let's define:
- H = attacker was 185 cm or taller
- L = attacker was shorter than 185 cm
- W1 = first witness's testimony that the attacker was 185 cm or taller
- W2 = second witness's testimony that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided:
- P(H) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(L) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness reliability:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time whether the person was H or L. 
  - P(W1 | H) = 0.80
  - P(W1 | L) = 0.20 (probability of witness 1 being wrong given the person is actually shorter)

- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time whether the person was H or L. 
  - P(W2 | L) = 0.70
  - P(W2 | H) = 0.30 (probability of witness 2 being wrong given the person is actually taller)

We want to find P(H | W1), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W1)} \]

Where \( P(W1) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is taller, which can be calculated using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W1 | L) \times P(L) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Plugging this back into Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W1) \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as claimed by the first witness, is approximately 0.414.
