To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update our prior belief about a hypothesis based on new evidence. Let us define the following:

- Let \( H \) denote the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) is the event where Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) is the event where Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability Witness 1 is correct given the attacker is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)

Similarly:
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability Witness 2 is correct given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

Witness 1 and Witness 2 provide conflicting statements, and to determine the probability of \( H \) given the information from both witnesses, we calculate using Bayes' theorem. However, only Witness 1 said the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and we are asked for \( P(H | W_1) \).

This can be calculated as:

\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

Where \( P(W_1) \) (the probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller) can be calculated by the law of total probability:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) 
\]
\[
P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Now, substituting back:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, given the statement of Witness 1, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller is approximately 0.414.

Final answer format:
{probability: 0.414}
