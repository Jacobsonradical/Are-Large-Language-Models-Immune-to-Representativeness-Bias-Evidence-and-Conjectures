To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies and their accuracy rate, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Prior Probability (P(H))**: This is the initial probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 15% (or 0.15), based on the city's height distribution.

2. **Likelihood (P(E|H) and P(E|~H))**: 
   - **P(E|H)**: If the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller, the probability that the first witness correctly identified this based on their 80% accuracy rate is 0.8.
   - **P(E|~H)**: If the attacker was shorter than 185 cm, the probability that the first witness incorrectly identified them as being taller, based on their 20% error rate, is 0.2.

3. **Marginal Likelihood (P(E))**: This is the probability of the first witness saying the attacker is 185 cm or taller regardless of the attacker's actual height. It is calculated as:
   - **P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|~H)P(~H)** 
   - Where P(~H) is the probability of the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, which is 85% (or 0.85).
   - Therefore, **P(E) = 0.8 * 0.15 + 0.2 * 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29**.

4. **Posterior Probability (P(H|E))**: This is the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller given the first witness's statement. It is calculated by:
   - **P(H|E) = P(E|H)P(H) / P(E)**
   - Thus, **P(H|E) = 0.8 * 0.15 / 0.29 â‰ˆ 0.4138**.

Therefore, based on the first witness's testimony and all given factors, the estimated probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller is about 0.4138.
