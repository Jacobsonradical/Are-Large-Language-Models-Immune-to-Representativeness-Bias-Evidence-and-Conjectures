To solve this problem, we need to use conditional probabilities and the Bayes' Theorem to determine the likelihood that the attacker had a height of 185 cm or taller given the claims of the two witnesses.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- \( H^c \) be the event that the attacker's height is less than 185 cm
- \( W1 \) be the event that the first witness says the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller
- \( W2 \) be the event that the second witness says the attacker's height is less than 185 cm

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability the first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1 | H^c) = 0.20 \) (Probability the first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W2 | H^c) = 0.70 \) (Probability the second witness correctly identifies someone as less than 185 cm)
- \( P(W2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability the second witness incorrectly identifies someone as less than 185 cm)

We are tasked to find \( P(H | W1, W2) \), the probability the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements.

Using Bayes' Theorem, this can be calculated as:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2 | H)P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = P(W1 | H)P(W2 | H) \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | H^c) = P(W1 | H^c)P(W2 | H^c) \]

Then:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2 | H)P(H) + P(W1, W2 | H^c)P(H^c) \]

Calculating the components:
\[ P(W1, W2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W1, W2 | H^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]
\[ P(W1, W2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, the probability:
\[ P(H | W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' statements, is approximately:
{probability: 0.232}
