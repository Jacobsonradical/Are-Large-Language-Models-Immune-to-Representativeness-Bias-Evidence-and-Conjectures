To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use the following Bayesian probability approach:

1. Define the probability distribution based on the general population:
   - P(H) = Probability that height is 185 cm or taller = 0.15
   - P(L) = Probability that height is shorter than 185 cm = 0.85

2. Define the probabilities that each witness correctly or incorrectly identifies someone's height:
   - P(W1|H) = Probability that Witness 1 identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are = 0.80
   - P(W1|L) = Probability that Witness 1 identifies someone as 185 cm or taller given that they are shorter = 0.20
   - P(W2|H) = Probability that Witness 2 identifies someone as shorter given that they are 185 cm or taller = 0.30
   - P(W2|L) = Probability that Witness 2 identifies someone as shorter given that they are actually shorter = 0.70

3. Use Bayes' theorem to find the revised probabilities based on the witnesses' testimonies. Bayes' theorem in this context states:
   - P(H|W1, W2) = [ P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H) ] / P(W1, W2)

Where
   - P(W1, W2) is the overall probability of observing both witnesses' claims (total evidence), calculated by:
     - P(W1, W2) = P(W1|H) * P(W2|H) * P(H) + P(W1|L) * P(W2|L) * P(L)

Calculations:
   - P(W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) + (0.20 * 0.70 * 0.85)
                = 0.036 + 0.119
                = 0.155

   - P(H|W1, W2) = (0.80 * 0.30 * 0.15) / 0.155
                  ≈ 0.036 / 0.155
                  ≈ 0.232

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, considering both witnesses' accounts, is approximately **0.232**.
