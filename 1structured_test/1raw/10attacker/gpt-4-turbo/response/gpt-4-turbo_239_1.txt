To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting testimonies and the accuracy rates of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem gives us the probability of a hypothesis (in this case, that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) based on the evidence available (witness testimonies) and initial beliefs (prior probability distribution).

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( T_1 \) as the testimony of Witness 1, stating that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( T_2 \) as the testimony of Witness 2, stating that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- \( P(H) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (given as 15% or 0.15).
- \( P(\neg H) \) as the prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (given as 85% or 0.85).
- \( P(T_1 | H) \) as the probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (given as 80% or 0.8).
- \( P(T_1 | \neg H) \) as the probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller (given as 20% or 0.2, since Witness 1 makes a mistake).
- \( P(T_2 | H) \) as the probability that Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm (given as 30% or 0.3).
- \( P(T_2 | \neg H) \) as the probability that Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm (given as 70% or 0.7).

According to Bayes' theorem, we first compute the probability of observing the testimonies \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) given \( H \):
\[ P(T_1 \cap T_2 | H) = P(T_1 | H) \times P(T_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24. \]

Similarly, compute the probability of observing \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) given \( \neg H \):
\[ P(T_1 \cap T_2 | \neg H) = P(T_1 | \neg H) \times P(T_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14. \]

Now, using the law of total probability, the unconditional probability of observing \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) is:
\[ P(T_1 \cap T_2) = P(T_1 \cap T_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(T_1 \cap T_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155. \]

Applying Bayes' theorem to find \( P(H | T_1 \cap T_2) \):
\[ P(H | T_1 \cap T_2) = \frac{P(T_1 \cap T_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(T_1 \cap T_2)} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} = 0.232258. \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies, is approximately:
