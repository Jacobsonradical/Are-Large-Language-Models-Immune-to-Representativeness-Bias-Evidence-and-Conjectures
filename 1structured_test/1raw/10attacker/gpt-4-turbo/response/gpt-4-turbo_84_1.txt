To solve this problem, we can utilize Bayes' Theorem, which helps in updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here, the hypothesis \( H \) is that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and the evidence \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the statements given by the first and second witnesses, respectively.

1. Define events:
   - \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
   - \( E_1 \): First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
   - \( E_2 \): Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

2. Known probabilities from the problem:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
   - \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (First witness correctly identifies taller individuals 80% of the time)
   - \( P(E_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies shorter individuals as taller 20% of the time)
   - \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies taller individuals as shorter 30% of the time)
   - \( P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Second witness correctly identifies shorter individuals 70% of the time)

3. Using these probabilities, we seek \( P(H | E_1) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claims so.

Bayes' Theorem states:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1)} \]

Where:
\[ P(E_1) = P(E_1 | H) P(H) + P(E_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
\[ = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.12 + 0.17 \]
\[ = 0.29 \]

Thus:
\[ P(H | E_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

So, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.414.

Therefore, the answer in the required format is:
{ "probability": 0.414 }
