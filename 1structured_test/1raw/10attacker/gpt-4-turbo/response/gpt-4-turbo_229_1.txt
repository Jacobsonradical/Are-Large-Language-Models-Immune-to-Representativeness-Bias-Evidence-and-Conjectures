To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem allows us to update our prior belief about the attacker's height based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses.

Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( \lnot H \) be the event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm. Let \( W_1 \) be the event that Witness 1 testifies the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) be the event that Witness 2 testifies the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem statement, we know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\lnot H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1 | \lnot H) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \lnot H) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies can be calculated as:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \lnot H) = P(W_1 | \lnot H) P(W_2 | \lnot H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \lnot H) P(\lnot H) \)
  \( = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Then:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.2323.
