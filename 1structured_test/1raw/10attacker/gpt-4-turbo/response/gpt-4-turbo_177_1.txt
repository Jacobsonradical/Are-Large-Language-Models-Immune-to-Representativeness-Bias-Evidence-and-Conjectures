To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the diverging testimonies of two witnesses and some statistical data about the population and each witness's accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_1 \) denote the event that Witness 1 claims the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
Let \( W_2 \) denote the event that Witness 2 claims the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.

From the statement:
- The probability that a randomly chosen person from the population is 185 cm or taller, \( P(H) = 0.15 \).
- The probability that a randomly chosen person is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).
- Witness 1 is correct about a person's height being 185 cm or taller 80% of the time, and hence \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \).
- Witness 1 is incorrect about shorter heights 20% of the time, hence \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 is correct about someone being shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time, thus \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \).
- Witness 2 is incorrect about taller heights 30% of the time, thus \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \).

We want to find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements. We can use Bayes' theorem here in the context of multiple evidences:

\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

The total probability of observing \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) is:
\[ P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness claims, is approximately:
{probability: 0.2323}
