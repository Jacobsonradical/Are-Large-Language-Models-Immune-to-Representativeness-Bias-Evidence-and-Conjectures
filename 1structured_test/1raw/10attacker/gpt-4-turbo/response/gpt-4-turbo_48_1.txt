To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness accounts and their accuracy, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

With given data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

From the witness's accuracy:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies those 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and incorrectly 20% of the time. So,
  \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.8 \) and \( P(W_1 \mid H^c) = 0.2 \).
- Witness 2 correctly identifies those shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and incorrectly 30% of the time. So,
  \( P(W_2 \mid H^c) = 0.7 \) and \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.3 \).

We want to find \( P(H \mid W_1, W_2^c) \), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that witness 1 claimed so, and witness 2 claimed otherwise (the complement of \( W_2 \), denoted\( W_2^c \)).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2^c)} \]

Calculating \( P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H) = P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(W_2^c \mid H) = 0.8 \times (1 - 0.3) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56 \]

Calculating \( P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H^c) \):
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H^c) = P(W_1 \mid H^c) \times P(W_2^c \mid H^c) = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.7) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06 \]

Calculating \( P(W_1, W_2^c) \) using total probability theorem:
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c) = P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2^c \mid H^c) P(H^c) = 0.56 \times 0.15 + 0.06 \times 0.85 = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

\[ P(H \mid W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{0.56 \times 0.15}{0.135} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed is:

{probability: 0.622}
