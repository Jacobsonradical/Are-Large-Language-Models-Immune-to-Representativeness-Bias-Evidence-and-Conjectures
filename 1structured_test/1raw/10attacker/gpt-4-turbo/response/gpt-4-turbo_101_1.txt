To solve the problem, let's define the following events:

- Let \( H \) be the event that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( \overline{H} \) be the event that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
- Let \( W_1 \) be the first witness correctly identifying the attacker's height.
- Let \( W_2 \) be the second witness correctly identifying the attacker's height.

From the data provided:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\overline{H}) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' accuracies are:
- For the first witness (first witness claims 185 cm or taller):
  - \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy if the attacker is actually 185 cm or taller)
  - \( P(W_1 | \overline{H}) = 0.2 \) (20% chance of incorrectly claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller when they are not)
  
- For the second witness (second witness claims shorter than 185 cm):
  - \( P(W_2 | \overline{H}) = 0.7 \) (70% accuracy if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)
  - \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (30% chance of incorrectly claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm when they are not)

We need to calculate \( P(H | W_1) \) based on Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

The denominator \( P(W_1) \) can be obtained using the law of total probability:
\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \overline{H}) P(\overline{H})
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.8)(0.15) + (0.2)(0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Thus:
\[
P(H | W_1) = \frac{(0.8)(0.15)}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]
