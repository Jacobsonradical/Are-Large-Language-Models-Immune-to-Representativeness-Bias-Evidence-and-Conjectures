To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Bayes' Theorem helps us update our probability estimate for a hypothesis based on new evidence. Here are the relevant probabilities:
- Let \( H \) represent the hypothesis that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E_1 \) represent the evidence that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- Let \( E_2 \) represent the evidence that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From the information about the witnesses:
- The first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 80% of the time and wrongly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time:
  - \( P(E_1 | H) = 0.80 \)
  - \( P(E_1 | H^c) = 0.20 \) (since they make an error in identifying shorter people as taller).

- The second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time and wrongly identifies someone as shorter 30% of the time:
  - \( P(E_2 | H^c) = 0.70 \)
  - \( P(E_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (since they make an error in identifying taller people as shorter).

To find \( P(H | E_1, E_2) \), Bayesian updating formula can be used:
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 | H) P(E_2 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1, E_2)} \]
Where
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = P(E_1 | H) P(E_2 | H) P(H) + P(E_1 | H^c) P(E_2 | H^c) P(H^c) \]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[ P(E_1 | H) P(E_2 | H) P(H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 \times 0.15 = 0.036 \]
\[ P(E_1 | H^c) P(E_2 | H^c) P(H^c) = 0.20 \times 0.70 \times 0.85 = 0.119 \]

So,
\[ P(E_1, E_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Thus,
\[ P(H | E_1, E_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting statements of the witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
