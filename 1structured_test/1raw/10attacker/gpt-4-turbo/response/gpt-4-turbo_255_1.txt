To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which in this context is used to update the probability estimate for the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the witness reports.

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) be the event that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness reports the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness reports the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% probability that a person is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm).
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability first witness is correct given the attacker is tall).
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability first witness is incorrect given the attacker is not tall).
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability second witness is correct given the attacker is not tall).
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability second witness is incorrect given the attacker is tall).

First, calculate \( P(W_1) \), the total probability of witness 1 claiming the attacker is tall:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) = 0.80 \cdot 0.15 + 0.20 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Then, apply Bayes' Theorem to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is tall given that witness 1 said so:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1)} = \frac{0.80 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Expressed as a number between 0 and 1, the estimate is approximately \( \{probability: 0.4138\} \).
