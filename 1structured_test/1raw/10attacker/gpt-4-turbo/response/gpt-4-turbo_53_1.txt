To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller based on the information from the witnesses and the general population data, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- Event A: Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- Event A^c (or simply not A): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

According to the population data:
- P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- P(not A) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

Each witness provides evidence about the attacker's height:
- Witness 1 says the attacker was 185 cm or taller (Event B)
- Witness 2 says the attacker was shorter than 185 cm (Event C)

The witnesses' abilities to correctly judge height:
- Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time (P(B | A) = 0.8, P(not B | not A) = 0.8)
- Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time (P(C | not A) = 0.7, P(not C | A) = 0.7)

First, calculate the probabilities that the witnesses will testify as they did under each scenario:
- Probability that Witness 1 correctly identifies A and Witness 2 incorrectly identifies not A:
  P(B | A) * P(not C | A) = 0.8 * 0.7 = 0.56

- Probability that Witness 1 incorrectly identifies not A and Witness 2 correctly identifies A:
  P(not B | not A) * P(C | not A) = 0.2 * 0.7 = 0.14

Using the law of total probability, the probability of the testimonies given the prior probabilities:
- P(B, not C) = P(A) * P(B | A) * P(not C | A) + P(not A) * P(not B | not A) * P(C | not A)
             = (0.15 * 0.56) + (0.85 * 0.14)
             = 0.084 + 0.119
             = 0.203

Finally, using Bayes' theorem to find P(A | B, not C):
- P(A | B, not C) = [P(B, not C | A) * P(A)] / P(B, not C)
                  = (0.56 * 0.15) / 0.203
                  = 0.084 / 0.203
                  = approximately 0.414

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.414.

Therefore, we can summarize:
{probability: 0.414}
