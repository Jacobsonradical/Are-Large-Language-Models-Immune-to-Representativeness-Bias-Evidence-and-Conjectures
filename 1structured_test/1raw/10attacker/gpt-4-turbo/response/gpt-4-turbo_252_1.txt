To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, despite the differing testimonies of two witnesses and the known distribution of heights in the population, we use Bayes' theorem. 

Let \(A\) be the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \(B\) and \(C\) be the events that Witness 1 and Witness 2 correctly declare the attackerâ€™s height category, respectively.

According to the information:

- \(P(A) = 0.15\) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \(P(\text{not } A) = 0.85\) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)
- Witness 1 has 80% accuracy: \(P(B | A) = 0.80\) and \(P(B | \text{not } A) = 0.20\)
- Witness 2 has 70% accuracy: \(P(C | A) = 0.30\) and \(P(C | \text{not } A) = 0.70\)

Let us denote \(D_1\) as Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \(D_2\) as Witness 2 claiming the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

- Since Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller, we use their accuracy when \(A\) holds and their error rate when \(\text{not } A\) holds:
  - \(P(D_1 | A) = 0.80\) (correct system identification for taller)
  - \(P(D_1 | \text{not } A) = 0.20\) (incorrectly says taller)

- Since Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, we use their accuracy when \(\text{not } A\) holds and their error rate when \(A\) holds:
  - \(P(D_2 | \text{not } A) = 0.70\) (correct identification for shorter)
  - \(P(D_2 | A) = 0.30\) (incorrectly says shorter)

We need \(P(A | D_1, D_2)\), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements. We compute this using Bayes' rule:

\[
P(A | D_1, D_2) = \frac{P(D_1, D_2 | A) P(A)}{P(D_1, D_2)}
\]

Since \(D_1\) and \(D_2\) are considered conditionally independent given \(A\) (and given \(\text{not } A\)),

\[
P(D_1, D_2 | A) = P(D_1 | A) P(D_2 | A) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24
\]

\[
P(D_1, D_2 | \text{not } A) = P(D_1 | \text{not } A) P(D_2 | \text{not } A) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14
\]

Thus,

\[
P(D_1, D_2) = P(D_1, D_2 | A) P(A) + P(D_1, D_2 | \text{not } A) P(\text{not } A) \\
= 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \\
= 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally,

\[
P(A | D_1, D_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements is approximately 0.232.
