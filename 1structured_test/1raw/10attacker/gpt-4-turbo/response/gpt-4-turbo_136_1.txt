To calculate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} \]

Where:
- \(P(H)\) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(D \mid H)\) is the probability of observing the given data if the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(D)\) is the probability of observing the given data.

Based on the information provided:
- \(P(H) = 0.15\), because 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller.
- \(P(\text{not } H) = 0.85\), because 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm.

The data \(D\) consists of the statements of the two witnesses:
- Witness 1 says the attacker is 185 cm or taller and is correct 80% of the time when the attacker is indeed that tall and wrong 20% of the time when the attacker is shorter.
- Witness 2 says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm and is correct 70% of the time when the attacker is indeed shorter and wrong 30% of the time when the attacker is taller.

Thus, the likelihoods are:
- \(P(\text{W1 says tall } \mid H) = 0.8\) (Witness 1 is correct)
- \(P(\text{W1 says tall } \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2\) (Witness 1 is incorrect)
- \(P(\text{W2 says short } \mid \text{not } H) = 0.7\) (Witness 2 is correct)
- \(P(\text{W2 says short } \mid H) = 0.3\) (Witness 2 is incorrect)

The overall probability of the data \(D\) given \(H\) and \(\text{not } H\) can now be determined:
- \(P(D \mid H) = P(\text{W1 says tall } \mid H) \times P(\text{W2 says short } \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24\)
- \(P(D \mid \text{not } H) = P(\text{W1 says tall } \mid \text{not } H) \times P(\text{W2 says short } \mid \text{not } H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14\)

Now calculate \(P(D)\) using total probability:
- \(P(D) = P(D \mid H) \times P(H) + P(D \mid \text{not } H) \times P(\text{not } H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155\)

Finally, apply Bayes' Theorem:
- \(P(H \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232\)

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, taking into account the testimonies of both witnesses, is approximately 0.232.
