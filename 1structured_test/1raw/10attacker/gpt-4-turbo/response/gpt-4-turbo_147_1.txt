To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem which mathematically computes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.

Let's denote:
H = Attacker is 185 cm or taller
¬H = Attacker is shorter than 185 cm
W1 = First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
W2 = Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the information provided:
P(W1|H) = 0.80 (probability first witness correctly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(W1|¬H) = 0.20 (probability first witness incorrectly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller)
P(W2|¬H) = 0.70 (probability second witness correctly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
P(W2|H) = 0.30 (probability second witness incorrectly identifies someone as shorter than 185 cm)
P(H) = 0.15 (prior probability that any person is 185 cm or taller)
P(¬H) = 0.85 (prior probability that any person is shorter than 185 cm)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies is:
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{P(W1, W2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W1, W2)} \]

We need to find P(W1, W2|H) and P(W1, W2), both of which can be expanded using the law of total probability.

1. **Joint probability of witness testimonies given H**:
\[ P(W1, W2|H) = P(W1|H) \cdot P(W2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]

2. **Joint probability of witness testimonies given ¬H**:
\[ P(W1, W2|¬H) = P(W1|¬H) \cdot P(W2|¬H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

3. **Total probability of both witnesses statements**:
\[ P(W1, W2) = P(W1, W2|H) \cdot P(H) + P(W1, W2|¬H) \cdot P(¬H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, using Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H|W1, W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

So, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.2323, or 23.23%.
