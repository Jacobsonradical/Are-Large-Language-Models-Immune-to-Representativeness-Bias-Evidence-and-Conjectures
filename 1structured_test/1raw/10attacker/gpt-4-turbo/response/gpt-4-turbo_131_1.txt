To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The first witness is correct 80% of the time, therefore:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (probability that the first witness claims the attacker is tall, given that the attacker is actually tall)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (probability that the first witness incorrectly claims the attacker is tall, given that the attacker is actually short)

The second witness is correct 70% of the time, therefore:
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (probability that the second witness claims the attacker is short, given that the attacker is actually short)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (probability that the second witness incorrectly claims the attacker is short, given that the attacker is actually tall)

We are interested in \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is tall given both witnesses' statements. According to Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) \) (assuming witness statements are conditionally independent given the height of the attacker)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) \) 

Therefore:
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

Using total probability, we calculate \( P(W_1, W_2) \):
\[
P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
            = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85
            = 0.036 + 0.119
            = 0.155
\]

Now we can find \( P(H | W_1, W_2) \):
\[
P(H | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the estimate of the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is {probability: 0.232}.
