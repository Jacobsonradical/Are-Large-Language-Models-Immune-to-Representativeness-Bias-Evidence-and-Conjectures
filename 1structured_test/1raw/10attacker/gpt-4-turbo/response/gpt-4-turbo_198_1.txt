To calculate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting statements of two witnesses and the population distribution of the city's heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. We define the following events:
- \( H \): Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \): Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): First witness reports that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): Second witness reports that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

First, we determine the prior probabilities from the population data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of population is shorter than 185 cm)

Next, we'll determine the likelihoods for witness observations:
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.8 \) (First witness identifies correct height [185 cm or taller] 80% of the time when true)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.2 \) (First witness mistakenly identifies someone as 185 cm or taller 20% of the time when they are shorter)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness mistakenly identifies someone as shorter when they are 185 cm or taller 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Second witness identifies correct height [shorter than 185 cm] 70% of the time when true)

We calculate the joint probabilities for each combination of height and witness reports:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(W_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

To find the probability of both witness reports \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \), we combine these with the prior probabilities:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) = (0.24 \times 0.15) + (0.14 \times 0.85) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Using Bayes' theorem, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given the witness reports is:
- \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \)
- \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \)

Therefore, the probability to the question asked, where we consider only the information from the first witness (who claims the attacker was 185 cm or taller, \( W_1 \)), is slightly different as only \( W_1 \) is considered. For \( W_1 \):
- \( P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} \)
- \( P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Thus:
- \( P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.41379 \)

Therefore, under only considering \( W_1 \), the format of your answer should be:
```json
{"probability": 0.41379}
