To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies and the population distribution, we can use Bayes' Theorem, which helps update our prior belief based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- A = Attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- B = Attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- W1 = First witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- W2 = Second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the given information:
P(A) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
P(B) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

The witnesses' accuracies:
P(W1 | A) = 0.80 (First witness is correct about taller individuals 80% of the time)
P(W1 | B) = 0.20 (20% chance first witness mistakenly says someone shorter is taller)

P(W2 | B) = 0.70 (Second witness is correct about shorter individuals 70% of the time)
P(W2 | A) = 0.30 (30% chance second witness mistakenly says someone taller is shorter)

We need to find P(A | W1, W2), the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' statements. We have two contradicting statements (W1 and W2), but unless additional information is given about dependency, it is reasonable to treat the witnesses' statements as their independent views. We calculate each witness’s testimony’s impact separately using Bayes’ theorem and then combine the information.

First, we update our belief after the testimony of the first witness:
\[ P(A | W1) = \frac{P(W1 | A) \times P(A)}{P(W1)} \]
\[ P(W1) = P(W1 | A) \times P(A) + P(W1 | B) \times P(B) \]
\[ P(W1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]
\[ P(A | W1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

We do similar calculations after considering the second witness:
\[ P(B | W2) = \frac{P(W2 | B) \times P(B)}{P(W2)} \]
\[ P(W2) = P(W2 | B) \times P(B) + P(W2 | A) \times P(A) \]
\[ P(W2) = (0.70 \times 0.85) + (0.30 \times 0.15) \]
\[ P(W2) = 0.595 + 0.045 = 0.64 \] 
\[ P(B | W2) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.85}{0.64} \approx 0.9375 \]

Now calculate P(B | W1, W2) using P(B | W2) and adjust the belief using the likelihood of P(W1 | B). It's complex due to multiple contradicting evidences, but effectively we would weight the independent probabilities by the reliability of witnesses.

Using a simpler probabilistic model based on witness accuracy:
\[ \text{P(A | contradictory statements)} = \text{weighted average based on witnesses' accuracies} \]
\[ \text{P(A | contradictory statements)} \approx 0.80 \times 0.4138 + 0.70 \times (1 - 0.9375) \]
\[ \text{P(A | contradictory statements)} \approx 0.33104 + 0.1875 \times 0.70 \approx 0.33104 + 0.13125 \approx 0.46229 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, considering both witness statements and adjusting for their accuracies and the baseline population distribution, is approximately 0.46229.
