To solve this problem, we use Bayes' theorem, which allows us to update the probability of an event based on new evidence. Let's define the following events:

- \( H \): The event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( L \): The event that the attacker's height is shorter than 185 cm.
- \( W_1 \): The event that Witness 1 claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \): The event that Witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

The problem gives us the following probabilities:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population are 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(L) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population are shorter than 185 cm)

The problem also provides the accuracy of witnesses:
- Witness 1 correctly identifies someone as \( H \) or \( L \) 80% of the time, and incorrectly 20% of the time.
  - \( P(W_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \) (probability witness 1 correctly identifies \( H \))
  - \( P(W_1 \mid L) = 0.20 \) (probability witness 1 is wrong when the true height is \( L \))
- Witness 2 correctly identifies someone as \( H \) or \( L \) 70% of the time, and incorrectly 30% of the time.
  - \( P(W_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \) (probability witness 2 is wrong about \( H \))
  - \( P(W_2 \mid L) = 0.70 \) (probability witness 2 correctly identifies \( L \))

We are asked to find \( P(H \mid W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is taller than 185 cm given Witness 1's statement. We use Bayes' theorem for this purpose:

\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)}
\]

where \( P(W_1) \) is the total probability of Witness 1 claiming the attacker is 185 cm or taller. By the law of total probability, we have:

\[
P(W_1) = P(W_1 \mid H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \mid L) \times P(L)
\]
\[
P(W_1) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29
\]

Plugging these into Bayes' theorem gives:

\[
P(H \mid W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, given that Witness 1 claimed so, is approximately:

{probability: 0.4138}
