To solve this, we can use Bayesian probability. We need to calculate the posterior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the evidence presented by the witnesses. We will denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( H \) (hypothesis), and the complementary event (shorter than 185 cm) as \( \neg H \).

### Given Data:
1. \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that a random person from the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that a random person from the population is shorter than 185 cm)

### Witness Accuracy:
- **Witness 1**: 
  - Correct if H (185 cm or taller): 80% (0.8)
  - Incorrect if H: 20% (0.2)
  - Correct if \( \neg H \) (shorter than 185 cm): 80% (0.8)
  - Incorrect if \( \neg H \): 20% (0.2)
  
- **Witness 2**:
  - Correct if H: 70% (0.7)
  - Incorrect if H: 30% (0.3)
  - Correct if \( \neg H \): 70% (0.7)
  - Incorrect if \( \neg H \): 30% (0.3)

### Calculations:
- \( P(W_1|H) \) (Probability first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller given attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.8
- \( P(W_1|\neg H) \) (Probability first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller given attacker is shorter) = 0.2
- \( P(W_2|H) \) (Probability second witness claims shorter given attacker is 185 cm or taller) = 0.3
- \( P(W_2|\neg H) \) (Probability second witness claims shorter given attacker is shorter) = 0.7

### Using Bayesian formula:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(W_2|H) \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|\neg H) = P(W_1|\neg H) \times P(W_2|\neg H) \)

Therefore:
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|\neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

Now, applying the law of total probability to find \( P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) \):
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2|\neg H) \times P(\neg H) \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally:
\[ P(H|W_1 \cap \neg W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Hence, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witness statements is about 0.2323.
