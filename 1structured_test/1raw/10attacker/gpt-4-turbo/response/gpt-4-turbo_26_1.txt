To estimate the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller ($H$), given the testimony of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where:
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, which is 0.15 (15%).
- \( P(E | H) \) is the probability of the evidence given that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of the evidence.

Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

1. **Calculating \( P(E | H) \)**:
   - Since the first witness is correct 80% of the time if the attacker is 185 cm or taller (correctly identifying \( H \)):
     \[ P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \]
   - Since the second witness would be wrong 30% of the time if the attacker is 185 cm or taller (incorrectly identifying \( \neg H \)):
     \[ P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \]
   Therefore, \( P(E | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \).

2. **Calculating \( P(E | \neg H) \)** (probability of the evidence given that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm):
   - The probability that the first witness is wrong if the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
     \[ P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \]
   - The probability that the second witness is correct given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm:
     \[ P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \]
   Therefore, \( P(E | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \).

3. **Calculating \( P(E) \)** (total probability of the evidence):
   - Using the law of total probability:
     \[ P(E) = P(E | H) P(H) + P(E | \neg H) P(\neg H) \]
     \[ P(E) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

4. **Calculating \( P(H | E) \)**:
   \[ P(H | E) = \frac{P(E | H) P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the estimate for the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' claims, is about 0.232.
