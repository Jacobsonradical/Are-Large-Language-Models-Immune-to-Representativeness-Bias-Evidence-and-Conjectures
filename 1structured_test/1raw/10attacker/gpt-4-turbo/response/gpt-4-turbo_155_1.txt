To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of two witnesses and the distribution of population heights, we can use Bayes' theorem. This theorem helps update our probability estimate based on new evidence.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event that witness 1 correctly identified the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event that witness 2 correctly identified the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem, we know:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1|H) = 0.80 \) (Witness 1 identifies a tall person correctly 80% of the time)
- \( P(W_1|H^c) = 0.20 \) (Witness 1 incorrectly identifies a short person as tall 20% of the time)
- \( P(W_2|H) = 0.30 \) (Witness 2 incorrectly identifies a tall person as short 30% of the time)
- \( P(W_2|H^c) = 0.70 \) (Witness 2 identifies a short person correctly 70% of the time)

We need to find \( P(H|W_1, W_2^c) \) using Bayes' theorem. Here, \( W_2^c \) implies the event where witness 2 claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which contradicts the attacker being 185 cm or taller.

Using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c) = P(W_1, W_2^c | H) P(H) + P(W_1, W_2^c | H^c) P(H^c) \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2^c | H) = 0.80 \times 0.70 = 0.56 \]
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c | H^c) = P(W_1 | H^c) P(W_2^c | H^c) = 0.20 \times 0.30 = 0.06 \]

Now,
\[ P(W_1, W_2^c) = (0.56 \times 0.15) + (0.06 \times 0.85) = 0.084 + 0.051 = 0.135 \]

Now we apply Bayesâ€™ theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1, W_2^c) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2^c | H) P(H)}{P(W_1, W_2^c)} = \frac{0.084}{0.135} \approx 0.622 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the testimony of both witnesses, is approximately 0.622.
