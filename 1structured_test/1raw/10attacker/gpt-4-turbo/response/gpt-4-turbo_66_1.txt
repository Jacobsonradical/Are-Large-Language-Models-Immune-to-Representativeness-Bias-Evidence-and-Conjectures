Let’s denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller as \( H \) and its complement, the attacker being shorter than 185 cm, as \( \neg H \). Given, \( P(H) = 0.15 \) and \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \).

We also have two witnesses, \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \), with respective accuracies. \( W_1 \) claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller, while \( W_2 \) claims the opposite. The conditional probabilities based on their accuracy are: 
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (Probability \( W_1 \) correctly identifies \( H \))
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (Probability \( W_1 \) incorrectly identifies \( \neg H \) as \( H \))
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Probability \( W_2 \) incorrectly identifies \( H \) as \( \neg H \))
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Probability \( W_2 \) correctly identifies \( \neg H \))

We want to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witnesses’ claims. According to Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability:

\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1 | H) P(W_2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1 | \neg H) P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

So:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimonies, is estimated at:
{probability: 0.232}
