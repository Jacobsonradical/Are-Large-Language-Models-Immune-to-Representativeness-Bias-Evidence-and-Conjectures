To solve this problem, we employ Bayes' Theorem to compute the posterior probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the testimonies of the two witnesses and the distribution of heights in the population.

Let \(A\) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \(W_1\) and \(W_2\) denote the witnessesâ€™ accuracies in reporting the height.

1. We know:
   - \( P(A) = 0.15 \) (prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on population statistics)
   - \( P(\neg A) = 0.85 \) (prior probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm)

2. We consider the accuracies of the two witnesses:
   - Witness 1:
     - Probability of correctly testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that it is true \( P(W_1 | A) = 0.80 \)
     - Probability of incorrectly testifying that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that it is false \( P(W_1 | \neg A) = 0.20 \)
   - Witness 2:
     - Probability of correctly testifying that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that it is true \( P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.70 \)
     - Probability of incorrectly testifying that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that it is false \( P(W_2 | A) = 0.30 \)

Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given both witness testimonies is:
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A)}{P(W_1, W_2)} \]

Where:
   - \( P(W_1, W_2 | A) = P(W_1 | A) \cdot P(W_2 | A) = 0.80 \cdot 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) = P(W_1 | \neg A) \cdot P(W_2 | \neg A) = 0.20 \cdot 0.70 = 0.14 \)
   - \( P(W_1, W_2) = P(W_1, W_2 | A) \cdot P(A) + P(W_1, W_2 | \neg A) \cdot P(\neg A) = 0.24 \cdot 0.15 + 0.14 \cdot 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

Thus,
\[ P(A | W_1, W_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Therefore, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the testimonies of both witnesses and accounting for their accuracy and the population distribution, is:
{probability: 0.2323}
