To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, we can use Bayesâ€™ theorem:

1. Let \( H_1 \) be the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller and \( H_2 \) be the hypothesis the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
2. Let \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claimed the attacker was 185 cm or taller and \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claimed the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.
3. The prior probabilities \( P(H_1) \) and \( P(H_2) \), from the city's height distribution, are 0.15 and 0.85, respectively.

Witness accuracy:
- The first witness correctly identifies height 80% of the time, making a mistake in 20% of cases.
- The second witness correctly identifies height 70% of the time, making a mistake in 30% of cases.

Calculating using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1)}{P(W_1)} \]
Where:
- \( P(W_1 | H_1) \): Probability that the first witness claims 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller = 0.8.
- \( P(W_1 | H_2) \): Probability that the first witness claims 185 cm or taller, given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm = 0.2.

\( P(W_1) \) (the total probability of the first witness claiming that the attacker was 185 cm or taller) needs to be computed using the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H_1) \cdot P(H_1) + P(W_1 | H_2) \cdot P(H_2) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.8 \cdot 0.15 + 0.2 \cdot 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

So, Bayes' theorem gives us:
\[ P(H_1 | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's claim, is about 0.4138.

Answer:
{probability: 0.4138}
