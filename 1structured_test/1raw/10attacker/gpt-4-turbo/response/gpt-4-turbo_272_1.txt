To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the statements from the two witnesses and the population height distribution, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem tells us how to update our initial beliefs (prior probabilities) in light of new evidence (likelihood of witness statements).

Let:
- \( H \) be the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) be the event that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) be the event that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

From the problem:
- The prior probability, \( P(H) \), which is the proportion of the population 185 cm or taller, is 15% or 0.15.
- The probability that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, \( P(H^c) \), is 85% or 0.85.
- The likelihood \( P(W_1 | H) \), which is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is true, is 80% or 0.8.
- The likelihood \( P(W_1 | H^c) \), which is the probability that the first witness says the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that this is false, is 20% or 0.2.
- The likelihood \( P(W_2 | H) \), which is the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, is 30% or 0.3.
- The likelihood \( P(W_2 | H^c) \), which is the probability that the second witness says the attacker is shorter than 185 cm given that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, is 70% or 0.7.

We are asked to find \( P(H | W_1) \), the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness claimed so.

By Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1)} 
\]
Where:
\[ 
P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) \times P(H) + P(W_1 | H^c) \times P(H^c)
       = (0.8 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.85) 
       = 0.12 + 0.17 
       = 0.29
\]
Applying this to Bayes' theorem:
\[ 
P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} 
           = \frac{0.12}{0.29} 
           \approx 0.4138
\]

Thus, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is approximately 0.414.
