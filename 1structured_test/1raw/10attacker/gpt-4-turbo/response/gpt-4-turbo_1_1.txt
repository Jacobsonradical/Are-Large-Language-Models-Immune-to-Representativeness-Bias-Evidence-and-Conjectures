To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller (denoted as \( H \)), given the two witness statements, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:

- \( H \) = attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( H^c \) = attacker is shorter than 185 cm
- \( W1 \) = first witness claims attacker is 185 cm or taller
- \( W2 \) = second witness claims attacker is shorter than 185 cm

From the given information:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W1|H) = 0.8 \) (Witness 1 is correct 80% of the time when the person is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W1|H^c) = 0.2 \) (Witness 1 is incorrect 20% of the time, thus says tall when the person is actually short)
- \( P(W2|H) = 0.3 \) (Witness 2 is incorrect 30% of the time, thus says short when the person is actually tall)
- \( P(W2|H^c) = 0.7 \) (Witness 2 is correct 70% of the time when the person is shorter)

Now, we want to find \( P(H|W1) \) and \( P(H|W2) \). We can find these using Bayes' theorem:

\[ P(H|W1) = \frac{P(W1|H) P(H)}{P(W1)} \]
where \( P(W1) = P(W1|H) P(H) + P(W1|H^c) P(H^c) = 0.8 \times 0.15 + 0.2 \times 0.85 = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \)

Thus, 
\[ P(H|W1) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.15}{0.29} = \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Since only solution for \( P(H|W1) \) is required, we focus on this calculation and ignore combining Witness 2 for now. 

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, based on the first witness's claim is approximately:
{probability: 0.4138}
