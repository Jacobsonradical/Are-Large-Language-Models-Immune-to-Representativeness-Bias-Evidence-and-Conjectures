To answer this question, we use Bayes' Theorem, which helps to update the probability of a hypothesis H (attacker 185 cm or taller) based on given evidence E (witness claims). We have two pieces of relevant evidence here (claims of the first and second witnesses), and their individual abilities to identify heights, which affects the reliability of their statements.

1. **Initial Probabilities:**
   - Probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller (H): \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
   - Probability the attacker is shorter than 185 cm (\( \neg H \)): \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \)

2. **Witness Accuracy:**
   - First Witness (W1 states H)
     - Correct when H (185 cm or taller): \( P(W1|H) = 0.80 \)
     - Incorrect when \( \neg H \) (shorter than 185 cm): \( P(W1|\neg H) = 0.20 \) [Given they err in 20% of the cases]
   - Second Witness (W2 states \( \neg H \))
     - Correct when \( \neg H \): \( P(W2|\neg H) = 0.70 \)
     - Incorrect when H: \( P(W2|H) = 0.30 \) [Given they err in 30% of the cases]

3. **Probability Computations with Bayes' Theorem:**
   - Probability that Attacker is 185 cm or taller given both witness statements (\( P(H|W1 \cap W2) \)):
     \[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{P(W1 \cap W2|H)P(H)}{P(W1 \cap W2)} \]
   - where
     - \( P(W1 \cap W2|H) = P(W1|H) \times P(W2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
     - \( P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H) = P(W1|\neg H) \times P(W2|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)
     - \( P(W1 \cap W2) = P(W1 \cap W2|H)P(H) + P(W1 \cap W2|\neg H)P(\neg H) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)
     \[ P(H|W1 \cap W2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Hence, calculated through Bayesâ€™ theorem, the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given the claims of both witnesses is approximately 0.232.
