To solve the problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. We need to calculate \( P(H \geq 185 | \text{Evidence}) \), where H≥185 means the attacker is 185 cm or taller.

Data provided or assumed:
1. \( P(H \geq 185) = 0.15 \) (prior probability – 15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
2. \( P(H < 185) = 0.85 \) (prior probability – 85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
3. Witness abilities:
   - Witness 1: 80% accurate (assuming this applies both for identifying ≥185 and <185 correctly).
   - Witness 2: 70% accurate (assuming this applies both for identifying ≥185 and <185 correctly).

Using Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | \text{Evidence}) = \frac{P(\text{Evidence} | H \geq 185) \times P(H \geq 185)}{P(\text{Evidence})} \]

First, calculate the likelihoods:
- \( P(W1 = H \geq 185 | H \geq 185) = 0.8 \) (probability witness 1 is correct given H≥185)
- \( P(W2 = H < 185 | H \geq 185) = 0.3 \) (probability witness 2 is incorrect given H≥185)
- \( P(W1 = H \geq 185 | H < 185) = 0.2 \) (probability witness 1 is incorrect given H<185)
- \( P(W2 = H < 185 | H < 185) = 0.7 \) (probability witness 2 is correct given H<185)

Thus, the likelihood \( P(\text{Evidence} | H \geq 185) \) is:
\[ P(\text{Evidence} | H \geq 185) = P(W1 = H \geq 185 | H \geq 185) \times P(W2 = H < 185 | H \geq 185) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \]

And \( P(\text{Evidence} | H < 185) \) is:
\[ P(\text{Evidence} | H < 185) = P(W1 = H \geq 185 | H < 185) \times P(W2 = H < 185 | H < 185) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \]

Now, calculate \( P(\text{Evidence}) \) using the law of total probability:
\[ P(\text{Evidence}) = P(\text{Evidence} | H \geq 185) \times P(H \geq 185) + P(\text{Evidence} | H < 185) \times P(H < 185) \]
\[ P(\text{Evidence}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Finally, use Bayes' theorem:
\[ P(H \geq 185 | \text{Evidence}) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]
