To estimate the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the conflicting witness testimonies and individual reliability of the witnesses, we can use Bayes' Theorem. We represent:

- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_1 \) as the event the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( W_2 \) as the event the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Given:
- \( P(H) \) = 0.15 (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(\neg H) \) = 0.85 (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm).

From witness reliability data:
- \( P(W_1|H) \) = 0.80 (80% likelihood first witness is correct if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_1|\neg H) \) = 0.20 (20% likelihood first witness errs if the attacker is shorter).
- \( P(W_2|H) \) = 0.30 (30% likelihood second witness errs if the attacker is 185 cm or taller).
- \( P(W_2|\neg H) \) = 0.70 (70% likelihood second witness is correct if the attacker is shorter).

We need to find \( P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) \), the probability the attacker is ≥ 185 cm given witness 1 says ‘tall’ and witness 2 says ‘short’.

Using Bayes’ Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) \times P(H)}{P(W_1 \cap W_2)} \]

Where:
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H) = P(W_1|H) \times P(W_2|H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \) (assumes witness independence given H).
- \( P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H) = P(W_1|\neg H) \times P(W_2|\neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \) (assumes witness independence given \(\neg H\)).

The denominator \( P(W_1 \cap W_2) \) is calculated as:
\[ P(W_1 \cap W_2) = P(W_1 \cap W_2 | H)P(H) + P(W_1 \cap W_2 | \neg H)P(\neg H) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

Plugging these into Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1 \cap W_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232 \]

Thus, the calculated probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, based on the given witness testimonies, is about 0.232.
