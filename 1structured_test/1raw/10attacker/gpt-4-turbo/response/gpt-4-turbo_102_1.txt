To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem. Bayes' theorem allows us to update our probability estimate for a hypothesis, based on new evidence. In this case, the hypothesis is that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.

Let's denote:
- \( H \) as the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_1 \) as the evidence from the first witness who claimed that the attacker was 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) as the evidence from the second witness who claimed that the attacker was shorter than 185 cm.

We need to calculate \( P(H | E_1 \cap E_2) \), the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given both witnesses' testimonies.

From Bayes' theorem:
\[
P(H | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H) P(H)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)}
\]

Let's first compute the prior probabilities and the likelihoods:
- \( P(H) \), the prior probability that a randomly chosen person from the city is 185 cm or taller, is given as 15% or 0.15.
- \( P(\neg H) \), the probability that a person is shorter than 185 cm, is 85% or 0.85.

We also need:
- \( P(E_1 | H) \), the probability that the first witness correctly identifies the attacker as being 185 cm or taller given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 80% or 0.8.
- \( P(E_1 | \neg H) \), the probability that first witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller given the attacker is shorter than 185 cm, which is 20% or 0.2.

- \( P(E_2 | H) \), the probability that the second witness mistakenly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm given the attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller, which is 30% or 0.3.
- \( P(E_2 | \neg H) \), the probability that the second witness correctly identifies the attacker as being shorter than 185 cm given the attacker actually is shorter than 185 cm, which is 70% or 0.7.

Using the law of total probability for the joint probability of \( E_1 \cap E_2 \):
\[
P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H) P(H) + P(E_1 \cap E_2 | \neg H) P(\neg H)
\]

Let's calculate \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H) \) and \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | \neg H) \):
- \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | H) = P(E_1 | H) P(E_2 | H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
- \( P(E_1 \cap E_2 | \neg H) = P(E_1 | \neg H) P(E_2 | \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)

So:
\[
P(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155
\]

Finally:
\[
P(H | E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.232
\]

Thus, the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, given both witnesses' testimonies, is approximately 0.232.
