To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem. The theorem in this context allows us to update our initial beliefs about the probability of the attacker being 185 cm or taller based on the new evidence provided by the witnesses.

Let:
- H = the hypothesis that the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( \neg H \) = the hypothesis that the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.
- E1 = the event that the first witness identifies the attacker as 185 cm or taller.
- E2 = the event that the second witness identifies the attacker as shorter than 185 cm.

We want to compute \( P(H | E1 \cap E2) \), the probability of H given both witnesses' observations.

From Bayes' Theorem, we have:
\[ P(H | E1 \cap E2) = \frac{P(E1 \cap E2 | H) \, P(H)}{P(E1 \cap E2)} \]

We need:
1. \( P(E1 \cap E2 | H) \) – the probability both witnesses make their respective observations given the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
2. \( P(H) \) – the prior probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
3. \( P(E1 \cap E2) \) – the probability of both observations occurring.

### Calculations

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Conditional probabilities of witnesses' observations**:
   - For the first witness:
     \( P(E1 | H) = 0.80 \) (80% accuracy identifying 185 cm or taller)
     \( P(E1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (20% error rate for shorter people)
   - For the second witness:
     \( P(E2 | H) = 0.30 \) (30% error rate identifying 185 cm or taller)
     \( P(E2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (70% accuracy for shorter people)

3. **Joint probabilities**:
   - \( P(E1 \cap E2 | H) = P(E1 | H) \times P(E2 | H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(E1 \cap E2 | \neg H) = P(E1 | \neg H) \times P(E2 | \neg H) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \)

4. **Total probability of \( P(E1 \cap E2) \)**:
   \( P(E1 \cap E2) = P(E1 \cap E2 | H) \times P(H) + P(E1 \cap E2 | \neg H) \times P(\neg H) \)
   \( = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \)
   \( = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

5. **Application of Bayes' Theorem**:
   \( P(H | E1 \cap E2) = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \)
   \( = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.23226 \)

Therefore, the probability that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller based on both witnesses' reports, is approximately:

{probability: 0.23226}
