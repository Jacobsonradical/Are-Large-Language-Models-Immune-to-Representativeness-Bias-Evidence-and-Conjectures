To compute the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the witnesses' testimonies and their respective accuracies, we can use Bayesian statistics. Let's denote \( H \) as the event that the attacker's height is 185 cm or taller, and \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) as the events representing the testimonies of the first and second witnesses, respectively, where \( W_1 \) indicates the testimony "185 cm or taller" and \( W_2 \) indicates "shorter than 185 cm".

We know from the question:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_1 | H) = 0.80 \) (First witness's accuracy for 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(W_1 | \neg H) = 0.20 \) (First witness's error rate for shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | \neg H) = 0.70 \) (Second witness's accuracy for shorter than 185 cm)
- \( P(W_2 | H) = 0.30 \) (Second witness's error rate for 185 cm or taller)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we want to find \( P(H | W_1) \), which is the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller given that the first witness testified so.

According to Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{P(W_1 | H) P(H)}{P(W_1)} \]

Where \( P(W_1) \) (the total probability of \( W_1 \)) is computed by the law of total probability:
\[ P(W_1) = P(W_1 | H) P(H) + P(W_1 | \neg H) P(\neg H) = (0.80 \times 0.15) + (0.20 \times 0.85) \]
\[ P(W_1) = 0.12 + 0.17 = 0.29 \]

Now, substituting in Bayes' Theorem:
\[ P(H | W_1) = \frac{0.80 \times 0.15}{0.29} \]
\[ P(H | W_1) \approx \frac{0.12}{0.29} \approx 0.4138 \]

Thus, the probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the first witness's statement, is about 0.41 or 41%.
