To solve this problem, we will use Bayes' Theorem:

\[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

Where \( H \) is the hypothesis that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, and \( E \) is the evidence provided by the witnesses.

**Let's parse the available information:**

1. **Population likelihoods:**
   \[ P(H) = 0.15 \] (Probability that a person in the population is 185 cm or taller)
   \[ P(H^C) = 0.85 \] (Probability that a person in the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Witness accuracy:**
   - **Witness 1:** Correctly identifies people who are 185 cm or taller 80% of the time
     \[ P(E_1 \mid H) = 0.80 \]
     Incorrectly identifies people shorter than 185 cm as being 185 cm or taller 20% of the time
     \[ P(E_1 \mid H^C) = 0.20 \]

   - **Witness 2:** Correctly identifies people who are shorter than 185 cm 70% of the time
     \[ P(E_2 \mid H^C) = 0.70 \] 
     Incorrectly identifies people 185 cm or taller as being shorter than 185 cm 30% of the time
     \[ P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.30 \]

**Joint witness testimony:**
   \[ P(E \mid H) = P(E_1 \mid H) \times P(E_2 \mid H) = 0.80 \times 0.30 = 0.24 \]
   \[ P(E \mid H^C) = P(E_1 \mid H^C) \times P(E_2 \mid H^C) = 0.20 \times 0.70 = 0.14 \]

**Overall evidence:**
   \[ P(E) = P(E \mid H) \times P(H) + P(E \mid H^C) \times P(H^C) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \]

**Applying Bayes' Theorem:**
   \[ P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \]

Thus, the probability the attacker is 185 cm or taller, given the witnesses' testimony, is approximately **0.2323**.
