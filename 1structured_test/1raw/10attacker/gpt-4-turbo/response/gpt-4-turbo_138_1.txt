To solve this question, we'll employ Bayes' Theorem, which states:

\[ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \times P(H)}{P(E)} \]

where:
- \( P(H|E) \) is the probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller given evidence from the witnesses.
- \( P(H) \) is the prior probability that the attacker is 185 cm or taller (15% or 0.15).
- \( P(E|H) \) is the likelihood of the evidence given that the attacker was indeed 185 cm or taller.
- \( P(E) \) is the total probability of evidence.

### Step 1: Define Events

Let \( H \) be the event "attacker is 185 cm or taller" and \( H^c \) be "attacker is shorter than 185 cm". From the data:
- \( P(H) = 0.15 \)
- \( P(H^c) = 0.85 \)

Let \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) be events:
- \( E_1 \) is that the first witness claims the attacker is 185 cm or taller.
- \( E_2 \) is that the second witness claims the attacker is shorter than 185 cm.

Witness 1's accuracy:
- \( P(E_1|H) = 0.8 \) (80% accuracy when attacker is indeed 185 cm or taller)
- \( P(E_1|H^c) = 0.2 \) (20% error rate results in witness claiming taller, when actually shorter)

Witness 2's accuracy:
- \( P(E_2|H) = 0.3 \) (30% error rate results in claiming shorter, when actually taller)
- \( P(E_2|H^c) = 0.7 \) (70% accuracy when attacker is indeed shorter)

### Step 2: Apply Total Probability Law for \( P(E_1 \cap E_2) \)

The joint event probability \( P(E_1 \cap E_2) \) is calculated by:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = P(E_1 \cap E_2|H)P(H) + P(E_1 \cap E_2|H^c)P(H^c) \]

\( P(E_1 \cap E_2|H) \) can be calculated (assuming independence of witnessesâ€™ observations given the height):
- \( = P(E_1|H) \times P(E_2|H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 \)

\( P(E_1 \cap E_2|H^c) \):
- \( = P(E_1|H^c) \times P(E_2|H^c) = 0.2 \times 0.7 \)

Plug values:
\[ P(E_1 \cap E_2) = (0.8 \times 0.3 \times 0.15) + (0.2 \times 0.7 \times 0.85) \]
\[ = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 \]
\[ = 0.036 + 0.119 \]
\[ = 0.155 \]

### Step 3: Calculate \( P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) \) using Bayes' Theorem 

\[ P(H|E_1 \cap E_2) = \frac{P(E_1 \cap E_2|H) \times P(H)}{P(E_1 \cap E_2)} \]
\[ = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \]
\[ = \frac{0.036}{0.155} \]
\[ \approx 0.232 \]

### Conclusion:

The probability that the attacker was 185 cm or taller, given the conflicting witness statements, is approximately 0.232.
