To find the probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller given the testimonies of the two witnesses, we can make use of Bayes' theorem. Let \( H \) denote the event that the attacker is 185 cm or taller, and let \( W_1 \) and \( W_2 \) denote the testimonies of the first and second witnesses respectively, where \( W_1 = \text{tall} \) and \( W_2 = \text{short} \).

1. **Prior probabilities**:
   - \( P(H) = 0.15 \) (15% of the population is 185 cm or taller)
   - \( P(\neg H) = 0.85 \) (85% of the population is shorter than 185 cm)

2. **Witness accuracies**:
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \mid H) = 0.8 \) (First witness correctly identifies tall 80% of the time)
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \) (First witness incorrectly identifies short people as tall 20% of the time)
   - \( P(W_2 = \text{short} \mid H) = 0.3 \) (Second witness incorrectly identifies tall people as short 30% of the time)
   - \( P(W_2 = \text{short} \mid \neg H) = 0.7 \) (Second witness correctly identifies short 70% of the time)

3. **Joint probability of witness testimonies**:
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short}) = P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short} \mid H) \cdot P(H) + P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short} \mid \neg H) \cdot P(\neg H) \)
    
    By independence of testimonies given the height:
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short} \mid H) = P(W_1 = \text{tall} \mid H) \cdot P(W_2 = \text{short} \mid H) = 0.8 \times 0.3 = 0.24 \)
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short} \mid \neg H) = P(W_1 = \text{tall} \mid \neg H) \cdot P(W_2 = \text{short} \mid \neg H) = 0.2 \times 0.7 = 0.14 \)
   - \( P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short}) = 0.24 \times 0.15 + 0.14 \times 0.85 = 0.036 + 0.119 = 0.155 \)

4. **Bayes' theorem**:
   - \( P(H \mid W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short}) = \frac{P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short} \mid H) \cdot P(H)}{P(W_1 = \text{tall} \cap W_2 = \text{short})} \)
   - \( = \frac{0.24 \times 0.15}{0.155} \approx \frac{0.036}{0.155} \approx 0.2323 \)

Hence, the estimated probability that the attacker's height was 185 cm or taller, as the first witness claimed, is about 0.2323.
