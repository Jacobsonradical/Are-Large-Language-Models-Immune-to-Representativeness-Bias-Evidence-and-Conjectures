{odds: 8} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' Theorem. Let A represent drawing the 4 cards from Deck A (where most cards are marked X) and let B represent drawing the 4 cards from Deck B (where most cards are marked O).

We want to find P(A|3X, 1O)/P(B|3X, 1O).

P(A|3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]
= ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2 ) / ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2 + (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2 )
= 8/9

P(B|3X, 1O) = 1 - P(A|3X, 1O) = 1/9

Therefore, the posterior odds are P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/9) / (1/9) = 8.
