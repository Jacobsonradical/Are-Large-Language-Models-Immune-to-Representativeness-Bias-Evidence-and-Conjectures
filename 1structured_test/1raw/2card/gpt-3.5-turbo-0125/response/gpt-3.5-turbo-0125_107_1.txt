{odds: 16} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as event A and Deck B as event B. Let X be the event of drawing an X card and O be the event of drawing an O card.

We are given:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

We want to find P(A|3X, 1O), the probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A given that 3 X's and 1 O were drawn.

By Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)]

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Plugging in the values:
P(A|3X, 1O) = [8/81 * 1/2] / [8/81 * 1/2 + 2/81 * 1/2] = 16/18 = 8/9

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8:1, which simplifies to 8.
