{odds: 9} 

To determine the posterior odds, we need to calculate the likelihood of the observed data happening under each deck and then compare them.

Let's denote:
- Event A: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A
- Event B: Drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B

The likelihood of Event A happening under Deck A:
Deck A: P(Event A | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

The likelihood of Event A happening under Deck B:
Deck B: P(Event A | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

Therefore, the posterior odds in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
P(A|Event A) / P(B|Event A) = (P(Event A|A) * P(A)) / (P(Event A|B) * P(B)) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (2/81 * 1/2) = 4 / 1 = 4

This means that the odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A is 4 times greater than the odds that they were drawn from Deck B.
