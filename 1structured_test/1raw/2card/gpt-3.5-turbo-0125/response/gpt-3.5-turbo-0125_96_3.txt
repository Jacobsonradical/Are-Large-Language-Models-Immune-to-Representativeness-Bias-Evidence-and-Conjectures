{odds: 8} 

To calculate the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A, and let B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We are given:
P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck A)
P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck A)
P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck B)
P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck B)

We are also given that 3 out of the 4 cards drawn are marked X and 1 is marked O.

P(3 X's and 1 O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 8/81
P(3 X's and 1 O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 2/81

Using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = (Prior odds) x (Likelihood ratio)
              = (P(A) / P(B)) x (P(3 X's and 1 O | A) / P(3 X's and 1 O | B))
              = (1/2) x (8/2) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
