{odds: 4} 

To calculate the posterior odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote event A as drawing 3 Xs and 1 O, and event B as drawing from Deck A.

P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / P(A)
P(A) = 1/2 (since the deck was picked by chance)
P(B) = 2/3 * 2/3 * 2/3 * 1/3  = 8/81 (probability of drawing 3 Xs and 1 O from Deck A)
P(A|B) = 1

P(A)  * P(B) / P(A) = (1/2 * 8/81) / 1/2 = 8/81

Thus the odds of selecting Deck A over Deck B is 8:1, which simplifies to 4:1.
