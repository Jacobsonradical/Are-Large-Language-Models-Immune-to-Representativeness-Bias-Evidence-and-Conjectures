{odds: 8} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

We are given:
P(X|A) = 2/3
P(O|A) = 1/3
P(X|B) = 1/3
P(O|B) = 2/3

We want to find the posterior odds:
P(A|3X,1O)/P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / [ P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) ]
P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / [ P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) ]

Calculate the probabilities of drawing 3X and 1O from each deck:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Plugging in the values:
P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2 / [ (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2 + (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2 ]
P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2 / [ (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2 + (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2 ]

Find the ratio of these probabilities to get the posterior odds:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = ( (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 ) / ( (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 )
                            = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 8.
