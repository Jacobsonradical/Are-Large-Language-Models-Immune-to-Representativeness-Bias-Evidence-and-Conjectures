{odds: 16} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let's denote Deck A as event A and Deck B as event B.

Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1/1 = 1 (since both decks are equally likely to be selected initially)

Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A = (2/3)^3 * 1/3 = 8/81
Likelihood of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B = (1/3)^3 * 2/3 = 2/81

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * (8/81) / (2/81) = 4 * 4 = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 16:1.
