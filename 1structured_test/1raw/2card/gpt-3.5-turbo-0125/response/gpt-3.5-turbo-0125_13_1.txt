{odds: 2} 

To find the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' Theorem:

Let A be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A and B be the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B.

P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(A) = 1/2

P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
P(B) = 1/2

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
P(A|3X,1O) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2 + 2/81 * 1/2) = 4/5

Therefore, the odds in favor of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 4:1, which simplifies to a posterior odds of 2.
