{odds: 16} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we first need to find the prior odds and likelihood ratio.

Prior odds = (probability of selecting Deck A) / (probability of selecting Deck B)
Since the deck was selected by chance, the prior odds are equal, so Prior odds = 1.

Likelihood ratio = (probability of observing the data under Deck A) / (probability of observing the data under Deck B)
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A is (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
The probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B is (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81
So, likelihood ratio = (8/81) / (2/81) = 4.

Posterior odds = Prior odds * Likelihood ratio = 1 * 4 = 4.

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1, which can also be expressed as 4.
