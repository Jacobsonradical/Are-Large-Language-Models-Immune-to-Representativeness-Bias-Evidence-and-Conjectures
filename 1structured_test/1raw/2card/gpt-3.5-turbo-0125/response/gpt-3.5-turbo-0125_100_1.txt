{odds: 4} 

To calculate the posterior odds, we can use Bayes' theorem. Let event A be drawing 3 X's and 1 O, and event B be drawing the cards from Deck A.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / [P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)]

P(3 X's and 1 O|Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * 1/3 = 8/81
P(3 X's and 1 O|Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * 2/3 = 2/81
P(Deck A) = 0.5
P(Deck B) = 0.5

Plugging in the numbers, we get:
P(Deck A|3 X's and 1 O) = P(3 X's and 1 O|Deck A) * P(Deck A) / [P(3 X's and 1 O|Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3 X's and 1 O|Deck B) * P(Deck B)]
= (8/81 * 0.5) / (8/81 * 0.5 + 2/81 * 0.5)
= 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 4:1.
