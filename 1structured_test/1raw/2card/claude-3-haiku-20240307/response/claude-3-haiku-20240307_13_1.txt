To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We want to calculate the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

The posterior odds are then:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The cards drawn are 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074
P(A) = 1/2 (assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected)
P(B) = 1/2

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.296 * 1/2) / (0.074 * 1/2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
