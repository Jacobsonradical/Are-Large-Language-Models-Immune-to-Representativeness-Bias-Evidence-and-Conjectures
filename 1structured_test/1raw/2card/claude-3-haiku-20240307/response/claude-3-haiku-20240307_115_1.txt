To calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that 3 out of the 4 cards are marked X
- O: the event that 1 out of the 4 cards is marked O

The posterior odds are given by:

Odds(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(X,O|A) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(X,O|B) is the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B, respectively. Since the decks were selected by chance, we can assume they are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Substituting the values:
Odds(A|X,O) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 4}
