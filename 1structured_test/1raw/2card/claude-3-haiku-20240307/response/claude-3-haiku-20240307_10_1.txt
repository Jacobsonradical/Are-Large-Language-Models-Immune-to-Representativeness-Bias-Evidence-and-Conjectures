To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by the formula:

Posterior odds = (P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)) * (P(Deck A) / P(Deck B))

where:
- P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) is the probability of Deck A given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O
- P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) is the probability of Deck B given that 3 cards are marked X and 1 is marked O
- P(Deck A) is the prior probability of Deck A being selected
- P(Deck B) is the prior probability of Deck B being selected

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, the prior probabilities are P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 0.5.

To calculate the probabilities of observing 3 X and 1 O, we can use the binomial distribution:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296296
P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.148148

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Posterior odds = (0.296296 / 0.148148) * (0.5 / 0.5) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.
