To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A compared to B can be calculated as:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(3X, 1O|A) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(3X, 1O|B) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/81

The posterior odds of A compared to B are:

{odds: 81/8}
