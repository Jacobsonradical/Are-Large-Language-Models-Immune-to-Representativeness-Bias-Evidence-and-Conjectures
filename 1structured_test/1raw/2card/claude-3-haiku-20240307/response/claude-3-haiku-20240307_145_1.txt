To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, we want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, which can be expressed as:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate this as:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, i.e., P(Deck A) = P(Deck B) = 1/2, the posterior odds can be simplified to:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) / P(3X, 1O | Deck B))

To calculate the likelihood ratios, we can use the given information about the card distributions in the two decks:

P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 27}
