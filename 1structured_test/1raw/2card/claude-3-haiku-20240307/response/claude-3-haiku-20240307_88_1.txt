To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let A and B be the events that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

We need to find the posterior odds P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O), where X and O represent the observed cards (3 X and 1 O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for Deck A and Deck B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

The posterior odds are:
P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
