To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 out of the 4 drawn cards are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, the posterior odds can be simplified to:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

To calculate P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O), we can use the given information about the composition of the decks:

P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) = 4.0

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4.0}.
