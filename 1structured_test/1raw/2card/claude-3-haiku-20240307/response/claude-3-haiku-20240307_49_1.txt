To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Bayes' theorem states:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)

where P(A|X,O) is the posterior probability that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We can calculate the necessary probabilities as follows:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074
P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
P(B) = 1/2

Substituting these values into Bayes' theorem, we get:

P(A|X,O) = (0.148 * 1/2) / (0.148 * 1/2 + 0.074 * 1/2)
P(A|X,O) = 0.667

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
