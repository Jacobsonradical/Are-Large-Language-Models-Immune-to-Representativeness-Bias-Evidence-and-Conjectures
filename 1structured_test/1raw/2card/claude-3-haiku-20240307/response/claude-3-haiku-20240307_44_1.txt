To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
- P(B|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), the posterior odds can be calculated as:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) / (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
