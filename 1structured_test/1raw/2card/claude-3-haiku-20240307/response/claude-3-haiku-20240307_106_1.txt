To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked X)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck A are marked O)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (1/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked X)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (2/3 of the cards in Deck B are marked O)
- The observed data: 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O were drawn.

We want to calculate the posterior odds of Deck A being selected compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)] / [P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)]

Assuming the prior probabilities of Deck A and Deck B being selected are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3)] / [(1/3)^3 * (2/3)]
= (8/27) / (4/27)
= 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 2}
