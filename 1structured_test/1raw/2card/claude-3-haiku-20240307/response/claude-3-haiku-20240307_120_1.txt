To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of A vs. B can be calculated as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

where P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the decks are selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5.

To calculate the probabilities P(X|A) and P(X|B), we need to consider the probability of obtaining 3 X's and 1 O from each deck.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.0741 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
