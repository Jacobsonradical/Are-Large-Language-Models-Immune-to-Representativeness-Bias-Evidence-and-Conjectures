To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The 4 cards drawn contain 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(B) / P(A))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(B) and P(A) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck B and Deck A, respectively.

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate the probabilities P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O), we need to use the binomial distribution:

P(A|X,O) = (3C3 * 2/3^3 * 1/3) / (3C3 * 2/3^3 * 1/3 + 3C3 * 1/3^3 * 2/3)
P(B|X,O) = (3C3 * 1/3^3 * 2/3) / (3C3 * 2/3^3 * 1/3 + 3C3 * 1/3^3 * 2/3)

Simplifying the calculations, we get:

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (2/3)^3 / (1/3)^3 = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 8.
