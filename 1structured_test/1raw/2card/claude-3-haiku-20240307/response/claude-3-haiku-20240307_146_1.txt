To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior odds = (P(A) × P(3X,1O|A)) / (P(B) × P(3X,1O|B))

Step 1: Calculate the prior probabilities.
Assume that the decks are equally likely to be chosen, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Step 2: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 × (1/3) = 0.148148

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 × (2/3) = 0.074074

Step 4: Calculate the posterior odds.
Posterior odds = (1/2 × 0.148148) / (1/2 × 0.074074) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.
