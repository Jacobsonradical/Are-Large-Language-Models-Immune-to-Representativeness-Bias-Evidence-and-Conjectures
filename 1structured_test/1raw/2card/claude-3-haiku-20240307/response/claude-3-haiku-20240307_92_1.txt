To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, which is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A, and P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate these probabilities:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Plugging in the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B)) = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * 1

Posterior odds â‰ˆ 4.5

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4.5}
