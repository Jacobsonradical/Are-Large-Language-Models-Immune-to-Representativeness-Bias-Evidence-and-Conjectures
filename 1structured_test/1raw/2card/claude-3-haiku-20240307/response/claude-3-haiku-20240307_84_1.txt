To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A versus B, which is given by:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074

P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B) = 0.111111

Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (0.148148 * 1/2) / (0.074074 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
