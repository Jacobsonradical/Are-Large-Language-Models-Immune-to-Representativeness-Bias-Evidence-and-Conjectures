To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, given the observed data.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively. Since the decks are selected by chance, we can assume that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27
P(O|A) = (1/3)
P(O|B) = (2/3)

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))
             = ((8/27) * (1/3)) / ((2/27) * (2/3)) * (1/2)
             = 12

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 12}
