To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

The posterior odds of A compared to B can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probabilities in the numerator and denominator:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X, 1O)

The prior probabilities are assumed to be equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck A is:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card given Deck B is:
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/81

The probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card, regardless of the deck, is:
P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B) = (8/81 + 4/81) / 2 = 6/81

Substituting these values, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (4/81 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
