To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X) / P(B|X)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X) is the probability of A given X
- P(B|X) is the probability of B given X
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculations:
1. Probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A:
   P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

2. Probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B:
   P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

3. Posterior odds:
   Posterior odds = (P(A|X) / P(B|X)) * (P(A) / P(B))
   Posterior odds = (8/27) / (4/27) * (1/2) / (1/2)
   Posterior odds = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.
