To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) × (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B.
- P(A) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A, which is assumed to be 0.5 (since the decks were selected by chance).
- P(B) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B, which is also 0.5.

To calculate the probabilities, we can use the binomial probability formula:

P(X = x | n, p) = (n! / (x! * (n-x)!)) * p^x * (1-p)^(n-x)

Where:
- n is the number of trials (in this case, 4 cards drawn).
- x is the number of successes (in this case, 3 X cards and 1 O card).
- p is the probability of success (in this case, the proportion of X or O cards in the deck).

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) = (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 = 0.296
P(B|3X, 1O) = (4! / (3! * 1!)) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 = 0.148

Posterior odds = (0.296 / 0.148) × (0.5 / 0.5) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.
