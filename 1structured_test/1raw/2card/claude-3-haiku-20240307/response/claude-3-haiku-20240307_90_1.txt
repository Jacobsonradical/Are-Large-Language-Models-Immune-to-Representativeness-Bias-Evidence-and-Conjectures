To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Bayes' theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)

Where:
- P(A|B) is the posterior probability of A given B
- P(B|A) is the likelihood of observing B given A
- P(A) is the prior probability of A
- P(B) is the prior probability of B

In this case, we want to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by:

Posterior Odds = P(A|B) / P(B|A)

Let's calculate the individual terms:

P(B|A): The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O cards, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
P(B|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

P(A): The prior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)

P(B): The probability of observing 3 X and 1 O cards, regardless of which deck they were drawn from.
P(B) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2) = 8/81 + 8/81 = 16/81

Plugging these values into the formula for the posterior odds:

Posterior Odds = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
            = (8/27) * (1/2) / (16/81)
            = 4/3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 4/3}
