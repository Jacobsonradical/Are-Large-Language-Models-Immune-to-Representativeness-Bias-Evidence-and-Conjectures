To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

The posterior odds are given by the ratio of the posterior probabilities:

Posterior odds = P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)

We can calculate these posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem:

P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A)) / P(3X, 1O)
P(Deck B | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B)) / P(3X, 1O)

Where:
- P(Deck A) = 0.5 (assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected)
- P(Deck B) = 0.5 (assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected)
- P(3X, 1O | Deck A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(3X, 1O | Deck B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27
- P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O | Deck A) * P(Deck A) + P(3X, 1O | Deck B) * P(Deck B) = 12/27

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(Deck A | 3X, 1O) / P(Deck B | 3X, 1O)) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
