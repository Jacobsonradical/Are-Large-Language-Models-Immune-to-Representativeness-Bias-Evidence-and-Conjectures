To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- D: The observed data, which is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(D|A) is the likelihood of observing the data given that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- P(A) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A
- P(D|B) is the likelihood of observing the data given that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- P(B) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- The observed data is 3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O.

Calculating the likelihood and prior probabilities:
- P(D|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(A) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities)
- P(D|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27
- P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probabilities)

Calculating the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = (P(D|A) * P(A)) / (P(D|B) * P(B))
Posterior odds = (8/27 * 0.5) / (2/27 * 0.5)
Posterior odds = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
