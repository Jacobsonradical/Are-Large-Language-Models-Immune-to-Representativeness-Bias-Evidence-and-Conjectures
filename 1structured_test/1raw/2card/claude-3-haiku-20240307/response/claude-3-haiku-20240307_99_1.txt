To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- 3 cards drawn are marked X, and 1 card drawn is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B)
P(X,O) = (2/3 * 1/3) * 1/2 + (1/3 * 2/3) * 1/2 = 1/3

P(A|X,O) = (2/3 * 1/3 * 1/2) / (1/3) = 1/3
P(B|X,O) = (1/3 * 2/3 * 1/2) / (1/3) = 2/3

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = 1/3 / 2/3 = 1/2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 1/2}
