To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O).

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

The posterior odds are then:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

To calculate the probabilities, we can use the given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3, P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3, P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since one of the decks has been selected by chance)

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

The posterior odds are then:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/81 * 1/2) / (8/81 * 1/2) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is {odds: 1}.
