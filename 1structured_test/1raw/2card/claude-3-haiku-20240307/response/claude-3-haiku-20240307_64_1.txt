To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The likelihood of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

The probability of observing the given outcome, P(X), is the sum of the probabilities of the two events:
P(X) = P(X|A) * P(A) + P(X|B) * P(B) = (8/27 * 1/2) + (4/27 * 1/2) = 6/27

Finally, the posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
