To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

To calculate P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O), we need to use the conditional probabilities:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X|A) * P(O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O))
P(B|X,O) = (P(X|B) * P(O|B) * P(B)) / (P(X,O))

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 0.5), we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5 / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5 / P(X,O)

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)
            = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 0.5) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 0.5)
            = (2^3 * 1/3) / (1^3 * 2/3)
            = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
