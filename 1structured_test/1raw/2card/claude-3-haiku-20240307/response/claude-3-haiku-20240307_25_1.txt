To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A is selected
- B: Deck B is selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3
- P(O|A) = 1/3
- P(X|B) = 1/3
- P(O|B) = 2/3
- P(3X, 1O) = the probability of drawing 3 X cards and 1 O card from the selected deck

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, which is:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)] / P(3X, 1O)
P(B|3X, 1O) = [P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)] / P(3X, 1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities for the decks, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X, 1O) = P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B)

Substituting the values, we get:
P(A|3X, 1O) = [(2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)] / [((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)) + ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2))]
P(B|3X, 1O) = [((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2))] / [((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * (1/2)) + ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * (1/2))]

The posterior odds of A over B is:
P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)

Simplifying the calculations, the answer is:

{odds: 4}
