To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B are equal, we have:

P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

To calculate the likelihoods, we can use the binomial distribution:

P(3X,1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X,1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
                      = ((4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2) / ((4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2)
                      = (2 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / (2 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
                      = (2 * (8/27) * (1/3)) / (2 * (1/27) * (2/3))
                      = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 8}
