To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963 (probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741 (probability of observing 3 X and 1 O, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B)
- P(A) = 0.5 (prior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck A)
- P(B) = 0.5 (prior probability that the cards were drawn from Deck B)

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X) / P(B|X)) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
Posterior odds = (0.2963 * 0.5) / (0.0741 * 0.5) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
