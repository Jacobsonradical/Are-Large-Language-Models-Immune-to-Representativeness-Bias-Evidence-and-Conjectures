To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: A card is marked X.
- O: A card is marked O.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)

Step 1: Calculate P(X,O|A)
P(X,O|A) = P(3 X cards, 1 O card|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

Step 2: Calculate P(X,O|B)
P(X,O|B) = P(3 X cards, 1 O card|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Step 3: Calculate P(A) and P(B)
Since the decks were selected by chance, we assume P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Step 4: Calculate P(X,O)
P(X,O) = P(X,O|A) * P(A) + P(X,O|B) * P(B) = (8/81) * (1/2) + (8/243) * (1/2) = 16/324

Step 5: Calculate the posterior odds of A compared to B
Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 27/7

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 27/7}
