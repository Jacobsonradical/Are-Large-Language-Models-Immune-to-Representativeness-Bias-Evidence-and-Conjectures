To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: The card is marked X
- O: The card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck B)
- Observed data: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

We can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, we can simplify the expression:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B))

Calculating the probabilities:
P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (8/27) / (8/81) = 81/27 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 3}
