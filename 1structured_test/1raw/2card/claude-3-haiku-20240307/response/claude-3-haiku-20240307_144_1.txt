To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, with 3 marked X and 1 marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds, P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

The posterior odds are then:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate the likelihoods, P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B), we can use the binomial distribution:

P(3X,1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X,1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
                       = ((4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1 * 1/2) / ((4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1 * 1/2)
                       = (4 * 8 / 27 * 1/3 * 1/2) / (4 * 1 / 27 * 2/3 * 1/2)
                       = 16

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 16}
