To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck B)
- P(3X, 1O) = the probability of observing 3 X-marked cards and 1 O-marked card

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (equal prior probabilities of selecting either deck),

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))

To calculate P(3X, 1O|A) and P(3X, 1O|B), we can use the binomial distribution:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (4 choose 3) * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)^1
P(3X, 1O|B) = (4 choose 3) * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)^1

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B)) = (8 * (2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / (8 * (1/3)^3 * (2/3)) = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 8}
