To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the card is marked X
- O: the card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 out of the 4 drawn cards are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(B) / P(A))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B.
- P(B) / P(A) is the prior odds, which is 1 since the decks are equally likely to be chosen.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(A|3X, 1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
- P(B|3X, 1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(B) / P(A))
Posterior odds = (8/81) / (8/243) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 3.
