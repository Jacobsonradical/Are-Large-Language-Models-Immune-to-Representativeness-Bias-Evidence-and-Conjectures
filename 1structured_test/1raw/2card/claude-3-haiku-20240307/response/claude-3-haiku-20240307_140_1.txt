To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

The posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|3X, 1O) is the probability of Deck A being selected given the observed data (3 cards marked X and 1 card marked O)
- P(B|3X, 1O) is the probability of Deck B being selected given the observed data
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively (assumed to be equal in this problem)

Calculating the probabilities:

P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)) = (8/81) / (8/81) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1.
