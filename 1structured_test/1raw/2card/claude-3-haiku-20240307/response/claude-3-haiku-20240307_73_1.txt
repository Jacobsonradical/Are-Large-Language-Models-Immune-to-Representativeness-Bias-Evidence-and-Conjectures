To find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, we need to use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

The posterior odds of A vs. B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

First, let's calculate the probabilities:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296 (the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck A)
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.148 (the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from Deck B)
P(A) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probability for selecting Deck A or Deck B)
P(B) = 0.5 (assuming equal prior probability for selecting Deck A or Deck B)

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (0.296 * 0.5) / (0.148 * 0.5) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
