To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the card is marked X
- O: the card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).

Using Bayes' theorem:
Posterior odds = (P(A) * P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(B) * P(3X, 1O | B))

Assuming that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (equal prior probabilities),
Posterior odds = (P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(3X, 1O | B))

P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
