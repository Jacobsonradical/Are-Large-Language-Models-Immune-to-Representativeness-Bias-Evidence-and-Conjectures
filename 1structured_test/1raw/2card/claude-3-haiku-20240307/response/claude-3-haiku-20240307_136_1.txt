To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds P(A|X) / P(B|X).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:
P(A|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / P(X)
P(B|X) = (P(X|B) * P(B)) / P(X)

Since the decks are selected with equal probability, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

To calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B), we need to consider the probability of getting 3 X's and 1 O from each deck:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Finally, the posterior odds are:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
