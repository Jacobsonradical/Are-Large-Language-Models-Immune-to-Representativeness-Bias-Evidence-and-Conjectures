To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the cards were drawn from Deck B

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data))

Where:
- P(A|data) is the probability of Deck A given the observed data (3 X cards and 1 O card).
- P(B|data) is the probability of Deck B given the observed data.

To calculate these probabilities, we need to find the likelihood of the observed data under each hypothesis (Deck A or Deck B) and the prior probabilities of the decks being selected.

Assuming the prior probabilities of the decks being selected are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), the posterior odds can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(data|A) / P(data|B))

Where:
- P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
- P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:

{odds: 2.0}

The posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is 2.0.
