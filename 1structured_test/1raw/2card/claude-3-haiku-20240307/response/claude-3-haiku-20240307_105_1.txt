To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 cards are marked X, 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Given information:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27
- P(A) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)
- P(B) = 1/2

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/27) * (1/2) / (4/27) * (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.
