To calculate the posterior odds, we need to use Bayes' theorem. Let's define the following:
* A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
* B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
* X: the event that a card is marked X
* O: the event that a card is marked O

The posterior odds are given by:
posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
* P(A|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A
* P(B|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B
* P(A) is the prior probability of selecting Deck A
* P(B) is the prior probability of selecting Deck B

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:
* P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
* P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
posterior odds = (0.2963 / 0.0741) * (1/2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 4}
