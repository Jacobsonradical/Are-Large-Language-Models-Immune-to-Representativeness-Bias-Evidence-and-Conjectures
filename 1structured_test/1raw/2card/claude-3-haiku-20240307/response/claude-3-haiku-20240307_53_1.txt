To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X-marked cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O-marked cards in Deck B)
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) / P(3X,1O)

Assuming equal prior probabilities, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

P(3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) = (8/27) * (1/2) + (8/27) * (1/2) = 8/27

Posterior odds = P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/27) / (8/27) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, are:

{odds: 1}
