To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
- P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
                = (8/27 * 1/2) / (8/27 * 1/2)
                = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 1.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 1}
