To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

The posterior odds of A compared to B is given by:
Odds(A|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]

Step 1: Calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B).
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.296296
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074

Step 2: Calculate the prior odds P(A) / P(B).
Assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds.
Odds(A|X) = [P(X|A) * P(A)] / [P(X|B) * P(B)]
Odds(A|X) = (0.296296 * 1/2) / (0.074074 * 1/2)
Odds(A|X) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 4}.
