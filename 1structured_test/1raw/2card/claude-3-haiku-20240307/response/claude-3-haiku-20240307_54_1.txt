To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X
- O: 1 card is marked O

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the individual probabilities:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, we can simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = (P(X,O|A) / P(X,O|B))

Now, let's calculate the probabilities:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Substituting these values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(X,O|A) / P(X,O|B)) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 3.
