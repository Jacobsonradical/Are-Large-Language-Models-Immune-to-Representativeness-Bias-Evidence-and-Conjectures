To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: The 3 cards are marked X.
- O: The 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck A, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards from Deck B, given that 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming that the two decks are equally likely to be selected, we have:
P(A) = P(B) = 1/2

Now, we need to calculate the conditional probabilities P(A|X,O) and P(B|X,O).

P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))
P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) / ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) + (1/3)^3 * (2/3))

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B)) = (0.296 / 0.704) * 1 = 0.42

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 0.42}
