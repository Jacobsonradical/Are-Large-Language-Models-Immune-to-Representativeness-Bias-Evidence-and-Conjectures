To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards are drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of a card being marked X in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of a card being marked O in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of a card being marked X in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of a card being marked O in Deck B)
- Observed data: 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O))

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Assuming that P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (since the decks were selected by chance), we can simplify the expression:

Posterior odds = (P(3X,1O|A) / P(3X,1O|B))

To calculate P(3X,1O|A) and P(3X,1O|B), we can use the given probabilities:

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/81

Posterior odds = (8/27) / (8/81) = 27/9 = 3

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 3.
