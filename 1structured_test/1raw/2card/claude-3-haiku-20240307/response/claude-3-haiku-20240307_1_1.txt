To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

The posterior odds of A compared to B is given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

where:
- P(A|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards (3 X, 1 O) from Deck A
- P(B|X,O) is the probability of drawing the 4 cards (3 X, 1 O) from Deck B
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively, which are both 0.5 since the decks are selected by chance.

Calculating the probabilities:
- P(A|X,O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
- P(B|X,O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Plugging the values into the formula:
Posterior odds = (0.148 / 0.074) * (0.5 / 0.5) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 2}.
