To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B.

The posterior odds can be calculated as:
Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the probabilities:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal (P(A) = P(B) = 1/2), we can simplify the calculation:

P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) / P(X,O))
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) / P(X,O))

The posterior odds can then be calculated as:
Posterior odds = (P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O)) = (P(X,O|A) / P(X,O)) / (P(X,O|B) / P(X,O)) = P(X,O|A) / P(X,O|B)

To calculate P(X,O|A) and P(X,O|B), we can use the given information:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9
P(X,O|B) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9

The posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = P(X,O|A) / P(X,O|B) = (2/9) / (2/9) = 1

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 1}
