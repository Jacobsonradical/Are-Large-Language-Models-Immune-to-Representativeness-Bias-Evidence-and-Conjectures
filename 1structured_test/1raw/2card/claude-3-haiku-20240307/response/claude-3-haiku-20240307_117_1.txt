To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A over B, given the observed data X.

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Assuming that the decks were equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Calculating the likelihoods:
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074

Substituting the values:
P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.148148 * 1/2) / (0.074074 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are 2:1.

The answer in the requested format is:
{odds: 2}
