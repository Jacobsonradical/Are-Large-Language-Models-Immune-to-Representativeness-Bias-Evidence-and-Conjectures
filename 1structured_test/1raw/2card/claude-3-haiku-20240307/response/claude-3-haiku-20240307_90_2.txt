To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards drawn are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

We can calculate the probabilities as follows:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Assuming equal prior probabilities for A and B, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
