To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 out of the 4 drawn cards are marked X, and 1 is marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Odds(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B))

where:
- P(X,O|A) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(X,O|B) is the probability of observing 3 X's and 1 O given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2, the posterior odds can be calculated as:

P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074

Odds(A|X,O) = (0.148 * 1/2) / (0.074 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is:

{odds: 2}
