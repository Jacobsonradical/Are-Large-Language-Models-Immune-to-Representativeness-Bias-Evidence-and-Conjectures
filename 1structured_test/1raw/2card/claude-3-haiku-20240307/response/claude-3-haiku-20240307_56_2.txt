To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following probabilities:
- P(A) = the probability that Deck A was selected
- P(B) = the probability that Deck B was selected
- P(3X, 1O | A) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that Deck A was selected
- P(3X, 1O | B) = the probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that Deck B was selected

Bayes' theorem states that:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O | A) * P(A) + P(3X, 1O | B) * P(B))

Assuming that P(A) = P(B) = 0.5 (since the decks were selected by chance), we can simplify the expression:
P(A | 3X, 1O) = (P(3X, 1O | A)) / (P(3X, 1O | A) + P(3X, 1O | B))

Now, we need to calculate the probabilities P(3X, 1O | A) and P(3X, 1O | B).

For Deck A:
P(3X, 1O | A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

For Deck B:
P(3X, 1O | B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/243

Finally, we can calculate the posterior odds:
Posterior odds = P(A | 3X, 1O) / P(B | 3X, 1O) = (8/81) / (8/243) = 3

Therefore, the answer is:
{odds: 3}
