To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

We can simplify the calculation by assuming that the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B are equal, i.e., P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.0741

Substituting the values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.0741 * 1/2) = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
