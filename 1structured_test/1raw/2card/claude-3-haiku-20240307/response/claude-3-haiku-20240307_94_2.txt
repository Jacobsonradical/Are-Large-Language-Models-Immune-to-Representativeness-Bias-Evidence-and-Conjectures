To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random from one of the decks, and 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

We want to find the posterior odds of A compared to B, which is:
P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:
P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / P(3X,1O)
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / P(3X,1O)

The prior probabilities of A and B are assumed to be equal, so P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of observing 3X and 1O, given the deck is A, is:
P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/81

The probability of observing 3X and 1O, given the deck is B, is:
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/81

The probability of observing 3X and 1O, regardless of the deck, is:
P(3X,1O) = P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B) = (8/81 + 2/81) / 2 = 5/81

Therefore, the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B are:
{odds: 4}
