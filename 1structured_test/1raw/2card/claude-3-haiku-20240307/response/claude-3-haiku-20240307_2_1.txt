To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card drawn is marked X
- O: A card drawn is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of drawing an X card from Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of drawing an O card from Deck B)
- P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) (probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck A)
- P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) (probability of drawing 3X and 1O from Deck B)
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (prior probabilities of selecting Deck A or Deck B)

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
              = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))
              = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3) * 1/2) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3) * 1/2)
              = 8

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is {odds: 8}.
