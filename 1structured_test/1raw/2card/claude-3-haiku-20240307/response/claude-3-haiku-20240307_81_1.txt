To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds.

Let's define the following:
- A: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: the event that a card is marked X
- O: the event that a card is marked O

Given information:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (probability of a card being marked X in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (probability of a card being marked O in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (probability of a card being marked X in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (probability of a card being marked O in Deck B)
- 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

The posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, can be calculated as:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O))

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior probabilities:

P(A|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))
P(B|3X,1O) = (P(3X,1O|B) * P(B)) / (P(3X,1O|A) * P(A) + P(3X,1O|B) * P(B))

Since the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

P(3X,1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(3X,1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 8/27

Substituting the values, we get:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) = (8/27) / (8/27) = 1

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, compared to Deck B, is:

{odds: 1}
