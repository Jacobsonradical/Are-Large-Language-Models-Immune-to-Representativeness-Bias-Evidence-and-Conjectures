To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A versus Deck B.

Let's define the following:
- A: Deck A was selected
- B: Deck B was selected
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given:
- P(X|A) = 2/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck A)
- P(O|A) = 1/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck A)
- P(X|B) = 1/3 (proportion of X cards in Deck B)
- P(O|B) = 2/3 (proportion of O cards in Deck B)
- P(3X, 1O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) (probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given Deck A was selected)
- P(3X, 1O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) (probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given Deck B was selected)
- P(A) = P(B) = 1/2 (assume equal prior probabilities)

The posterior odds of Deck A being selected compared to Deck B is given by:

Posterior odds = P(A|3X, 1O) / P(B|3X, 1O)
            = (P(3X, 1O|A) * P(A)) / (P(3X, 1O|B) * P(B))
            = (P(3X, 1O|A) / P(3X, 1O|B))
            = ((2/3)^3 * (1/3)) / ((1/3)^3 * (2/3))
            = (8/27) / (2/27)
            = 4

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 4.
