To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: A card is marked X
- O: A card is marked O

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 3 cards are marked X, and 1 card is marked O.

We want to find the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B, denoted as P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O).

Using Bayes' theorem:
P(A|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / P(X,O)
P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) / P(X,O)

Assuming that the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck A, is:
P(X,O|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, given that the cards were drawn from Deck B, is:
P(X,O|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card, regardless of the deck, is:
P(X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) + (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) = (8/27 * 1/2) + (4/27 * 1/2) = 6/27

Finally, the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:
P(A|X,O) / P(B|X,O) = (P(X,O|A) * P(A)) / (P(X,O|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
