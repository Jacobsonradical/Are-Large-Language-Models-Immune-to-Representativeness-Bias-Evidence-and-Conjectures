To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, 1/3 of the cards are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, 2/3 of the cards are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' Theorem, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B is:

Posterior odds = (P(A|3X,1O) / P(B|3X,1O)) * (P(A) / P(B))

Where:
- P(A|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck A.
- P(B|3X,1O) is the probability of drawing 3 X and 1 O from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively, which are both 0.5 since one of the decks has been selected by chance.

Calculating the probabilities:
P(A|3X,1O) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.148148
P(B|3X,1O) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.074074
P(A) / P(B) = 1

Substituting the values, we get the posterior odds:

Posterior odds = (0.148148 / 0.074074) * 1 = 2

Therefore, the answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
