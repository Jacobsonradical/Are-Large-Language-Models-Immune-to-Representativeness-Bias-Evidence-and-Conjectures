To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards have been drawn at random, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's denote the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A as A, and the event that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck B as B.

Using Bayes' theorem, the posterior odds are given by:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data)) = (P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) * P(B))

Where:
- P(data|A) is the probability of observing the data (3 X cards and 1 O card) given that the cards were drawn from Deck A.
- P(data|B) is the probability of observing the data given that the cards were drawn from Deck B.
- P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities of selecting Deck A and Deck B, respectively.

Assuming the prior probabilities are equal, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck A is:
P(data|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27

The probability of observing 3 X cards and 1 O card given that the cards were drawn from Deck B is:
P(data|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 2/27

Therefore, the posterior odds are:
Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data)) = (P(data|A) * P(A) / P(data|B) * P(B)) = (8/27) / (2/27) = 4

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 4}
