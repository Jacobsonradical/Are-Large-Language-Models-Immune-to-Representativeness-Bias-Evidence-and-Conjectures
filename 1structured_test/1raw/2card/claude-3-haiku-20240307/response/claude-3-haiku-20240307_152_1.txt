To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the 4 cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O.

Given information:
- In Deck A, 2/3 of the cards are marked X and 1/3 are marked O.
- In Deck B, 1/3 of the cards are marked X and 2/3 are marked O.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Step 1: Calculate P(X|A) and P(X|B)
P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.1481

Step 2: Calculate the prior odds P(A) / P(B)
Assuming the decks are equally likely to be selected, P(A) = P(B) = 1/2.
Prior odds = P(A) / P(B) = 1

Step 3: Calculate the posterior odds
Posterior odds = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))
Posterior odds = (0.2963 * 1/2) / (0.1481 * 1/2) = 2

Therefore, the answer is:

{odds: 2}
