To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Given information:
- Deck A: 2/3 of the cards are marked X, and 1/3 are marked O.
- Deck B: 1/3 of the cards are marked X, and 2/3 are marked O.
- 4 cards were drawn, of which 3 are marked X and 1 is marked O.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A.
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B.

Using Bayes' theorem, we can calculate the posterior odds as follows:

Posterior odds = (P(A|data) / P(B|data))

To calculate the numerator, P(A|data), we need to find the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck A.
P(A|data) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 0.2963

To calculate the denominator, P(B|data), we need to find the probability of getting 3 X cards and 1 O card from Deck B.
P(B|data) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 0.1481

Posterior odds = P(A|data) / P(B|data) = 0.2963 / 0.1481 = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, is 2.

The answer in the requested format is:

{odds: 2}
