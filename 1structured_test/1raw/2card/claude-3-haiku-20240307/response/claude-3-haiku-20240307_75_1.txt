To solve this problem, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior odds of the cards being drawn from Deck A compared to Deck B.

Let's define the following events:
- A: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck A
- B: The 4 cards were drawn from Deck B
- X: 3 cards are marked X and 1 card is marked O

We want to find the posterior odds of A vs B, given the observed outcome X.

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (P(X|A) * P(A)) / (P(X|B) * P(B))

Now, let's calculate the individual probabilities:

P(X|A) = (2/3)^3 * (1/3) = 8/27
P(X|B) = (1/3)^3 * (2/3) = 4/27
P(A) = 1 (since one of the decks has been selected)
P(B) = 1 (since one of the decks has been selected)

Substituting these values, we get:

P(A|X) / P(B|X) = (8/27) / (4/27) = 2

Therefore, the posterior odds that the 4 cards were drawn from Deck A, the deck where most cards are marked X, compared to Deck B, the deck where most cards are marked O, are:

{odds: 2}
